ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
No O’Reilly book that I author can go to print without me acknowledging the 
awesome team at O’Reilly. Dawn Schanafelt is editor extraordinaire. She can spot 
potential points of confusion in my writing from a mile away and usually comes up 
with a wonderfully clear alternative. If she’s stumped, she asks for clarification in a 
way that even a diva (oh, I so hope I haven’t become one) wouldn’t mind. She stays on 
top of details so they’re taken care of before anyone even thinks to ask. She keeps me 
company via email as we both work weekend after weekend to complete this book.
My thanks also go to Kara Ebrahim and the rest of the O’Reilly folks for shepherding 
my book through the production process. There’s nothing like curling up in a comfy 
chair with a glass of wine and a great book index. My thanks to Ron Strauss for 
making this book’s index special. I am grateful for the eagle eye of proofreader Julie 
Van Keuren for wrangling punctuation, capitalization, and ungainly sentences into 
submission. Michael Cobb was my technical go-to guy. He made sure my explanations 
make sense, my instructions are accurate, and answered the questions I couldn’t.

T
housands of small companies and nonprofit organizations turn to QuickBooks 
to keep their finances on track. And over the years, Intuit has introduced various 
editions of the program to satisfy the needs of different types of companies. 
Back when milk was simply milk, you either used QuickBooks or you didn’t. But now, 
when you can choose milk from soybeans, nuts, rice, and cows—with five different 
levels of fat—it’s no surprise that QuickBooks comes in a variety of editions (which, 
in some cases, are dramatically different from their siblings), as well as six industry-
specific editions. From the smallest of sole proprietorships to burgeoning enterprises, 
one of these editions is likely to meet your organization’s needs and budget.
QuickBooks isn’t hard to learn. Many of the features that you’re familiar with from 
other programs work the same way in QuickBooks—windows, dialog boxes, drop-
down lists, and keyboard shortcuts, to name a few. And with each new version, Intuit 
has added enhancements and features to make your workflow smoother and faster. 
The challenge is knowing what to do according to accounting rules, and how to do 
it in QuickBooks. This book teaches you how to use QuickBooks and explains the 
accounting concepts behind what you’re doing.
What’s New in QuickBooks 2015
Despite the fluctuating size of the tax code, accounting and bookkeeping practices 
don’t change much each year. The changes in QuickBooks 2015 are mostly small 
tweaks and subtle improvements, but some of them might be just what you’ve 
been waiting for:
Introduction

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
xvi
WHAT’S 
NEW IN 
QUICKBOOKS 
2015
• Insights tab in the Home window. In previous versions of QuickBooks, the 
Home window contained, well, the Home Page, which shows bookkeeping 
workflow and helps you access the QuickBooks features you use most often. In 
QuickBooks 2015, the Home window has two tabs at its top left. As you might 
expect, the Home Page tab displays the Home Page you’re familiar with. When 
you click the new Insights tab (page 44), you see a dashboard that highlights 
your company’s financial status and activity. Initially, the tab’s top panel displays 
a colorful Profit & Loss graph: green bars represent your monthly income, blue 
bars indicate your monthly expenses, and a black line graphs your profit by 
month. But that’s not all! You can click the arrows on either side of this panel to 
view other high-level graphs, such as a comparison between the current year and 
the previous year, top customers by sales, and trends in income and expenses.
The bottom half of the Insights tab displays more details about your income 
and expenses. On the left, the Income section is like a mini Income Tracker 
(described next, and covered in detail on page 338); it lets you quickly scan 
totals for unpaid invoices, overdue invoices, and customer payments received 
in the past 30 days. And the Expenses list and pie chart on the right help you 
identify where you spend the most money.
• Income Tracker upgrades. Income Tracker (page 338) boasts a couple of helpful 
enhancements. In addition to colored boxes for estimates, open invoices (that is, 
invoiced income that isn’t due yet), overdue invoices, and recent customer pay­
ments, Income Tracker now also displays a box for unbilled time and expenses. 
In QuickBooks 2015, you can specify the unbilled categories you want to see 
by clicking the Settings icon at the window’s top right (it looks like a gear), and 
then clicking the checkboxes to turn unbilled categories on or off.
• Updated Reminders window. The Reminders window (page 483) has a new 
look. On the left side of the window, you now see to-dos and transactions that 
are due as of today, so you know what’s on deck for your workday. The list on 
the window’s right shows to-dos and transactions that are coming up soon. If a 
category is collapsed, click the flippy triangle next to its heading to show each 
reminder in that section. To collapse a category, click the flippy triangle to hide 
its individual reminders.
• Pinned notes. QuickBooks’ various centers have a new twist: You can now 
select a note associated with a vendor, customer, or employee and “pin” it so it 
appears at the center’s top right when you select that name in the center’s name 
list (page 481). For example, say you create a note about an issue a customer 
has with an order. You can pin that note in the Customer Center so that, when­
ever you select that customer in the Customer Center, the note is easy to spot. 
• New report formatting. QuickBooks’ reports sport new formatting that makes 
them much easier to read (page 583). The rows for top-level categories are 
shaded gray, lower-level category rows are shaded beige, and rows with totals 
are shaded light gray.

INTRODUCTION

WHEN 
QUICKBOOKS 
MAY NOT BE 
THE ANSWER
• Updated online payments. If you install QuickBooks 2015 when it’s first released 
(this version of the program is called R1 and usually comes out in September), 
you won’t see online payment links and settings. Big changes for online pay­
ments were still in the works when this book was written. To learn about these 
new features, download Appendix E from this book’s Missing CD page at www.
missingmanuals.com/cds.
When QuickBooks May Not Be the Answer
When you run a business (or a nonprofit), you track company finances for two rea­
sons: to keep your business running smoothly and to generate the reports required 
by the IRS, SEC, and anyone else you have to answer to. QuickBooks helps you 
perform basic financial tasks, track your financial situation, and manage your busi­
ness to make it even better. But before you read any further, here are a few things 
you shouldn’t try to do with QuickBooks:
• Work with more than 14,500 unique inventory items or 14,500 contact 
names. QuickBooks Pro and Premier company files can hold up to 14,500 inven­
tory items and a combined total of up to 14,500 customer, vendor, employee, 
and other (Other Names List) names. (In the QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 
edition of the program, the number of names is virtually unlimited.)
• Track personal finances. Even if you’re a company of one, keeping your personal 
finances separate from your business finances is a good move, particularly when 
it comes to tax reporting. In addition to opening a separate checking account 
for your business, you should also track your personal finances somewhere else 
(like in Quicken). If you do decide to use QuickBooks, at least create a separate 
company file for your personal financial info.
• Track the performance of stocks and bonds. QuickBooks isn’t meant to keep 
track of the capital gains and dividends you earn from investments such as 
stocks and bonds. Of course, companies invest in things like equipment and 
office buildings, and you should track investments such as these in QuickBooks. 
However, in QuickBooks, they show up as assets of your company (page 57).
• Manage specialized details about customer relationships. Lots of information 
goes into keeping customers happy. With QuickBooks, you can stay on top of 
customer activities with features like to-dos, notes, reminders, and memorized 
transactions. You can also keep track of leads before they turn into customers. 
But if you need to track details for thousands of members or customers, items 
sold on consignment, project progress, or tasks related to managing projects, 
a customer-management program or a program like Microsoft Excel or Access 
might be a better solution.
 NOTE 	 Some third-party customer-management programs integrate with QuickBooks (page 94).

CHOOSING THE 
RIGHT EDITION
Choosing the Right Edition
QuickBooks comes in a gamut of editions, offering options for organizations at both 
ends of the small-business spectrum. QuickBooks Pro handles the basic needs of 
most businesses, whereas Enterprise Solutions (the most robust and powerful edi­
tion of QuickBooks) boasts enhanced features and speed for the biggest of small 
businesses. On the other hand, the online editions of QuickBooks offer features that 
are available anytime you’re online.
 WARNING 	 QuickBooks for Mac and QuickBooks Online both differ significantly from the Windows version 
of the program, so this book isn’t meant to be a guide to the Mac version or QuickBooks Online. Likewise, features 
vary in the desktop editions for different countries; this book covers the U.S. version.
This book focuses on QuickBooks Pro because its balance of features and price 
makes it the most popular edition. Throughout this book, you’ll find notes about 
features offered in the Premier edition, which is one step up from Pro. (Whether 
you’re willing to pay for these additional features is up to you.) Here’s an overview 
of what each edition can do:
• QuickBooks Online Simple Start is a low-cost online option for small businesses 
with very simple accounting needs and only one person running QuickBooks 
at a time. It’s easy to set up and use, but it doesn’t offer features like entering 
bills, managing inventory, tracking time, or sharing your company file with your 
accountant, and you can download transactions from only one bank (or credit 
card) account.
• QuickBooks Online Essentials allows up to three people to run QuickBooks 
at a time and lets you connect to as many bank or credit card accounts as you 
want. As its name suggests, it offers essential features like automated invoicing, 
entering bills, and controlling what users can access.
• QuickBooks Online Plus has most of the features of QuickBooks Pro, but you 
access the program via the Web instead of running it on your PC.
 NOTE 	 These online editions let you use QuickBooks anywhere, on any computer, tablet, or smartphone, 
so they’re ideal for someone who’s always on the go. They’re subscription-based, so you pay a monthly fee to 
use them. Although a year’s subscription adds up to more than what you’d typically pay to buy a license for 
QuickBooks Pro, with a subscription, your software is always up to date—you don’t have to upgrade it or convert 
your company files to the new versions you install.
• QuickBooks Pro is the workhorse desktop edition. It lets up to three people work 
on a company file at a time and includes features for tasks such as invoicing; 
entering and paying bills; job costing; creating estimates; saving and distribut­
ing reports and forms as email attachments; creating budgets; projecting cash 
flow; tracking mileage; customizing forms; customizing prices with price levels; 
printing shipping labels; and integrating with Word, Excel, and hundreds of other

RIGHT EDITION
programs. QuickBooks Pro’s name lists—customers, vendors, employees, and 
so on—can include up to a combined total of 14,500 entries. Other lists, like the 
chart of accounts, can have up to 10,000 entries each.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks Pro Plus is a subscription product that costs a little more than the one-time license fee you 
pay for QuickBooks Pro, but QuickBooks Pro Plus offers mobile access, unlimited phone support, online backups, 
and always-up-to-date software. Similarly, QuickBooks Premier Plus is the premier version of the subscription 
product.
• QuickBooks Premier is another multi-user edition (up to five simultaneous us­
ers). It can handle inventory items assembled from other items and components, 
generate purchase orders from sales orders and estimates, apply price levels 
to individual items, export report templates, produce budgets and forecasts, 
and work with different units of measure for items. Plus, it offers enhanced 
invoicing for time and expenses, and includes a few extra features like revers­
ing journal entries. When you purchase QuickBooks Premier, you can choose 
from six different industry-specific flavors (see the next section). Like the Pro 
edition, Premier can handle a combined total of up to 14,500 name list entries.
• Enterprise Solutions is the edition for midsized operations. It’s faster, big­
ger, and more robust than its siblings. Up to 30 people can access a company 
file at the same time, and this simultaneous access is at least twice as fast as 
in the Pro or Premier edition. The program’s database can handle more than 
100,000 names in its Customer, Vendor, Employee, and Other Names lists. It 
can track inventory in multiple warehouses or stores and produce combined 
reports for those companies and locations. And because more people can use 
your company file at once, this edition has features such as an enhanced audit 
trail, more options for assigning or limiting user permissions, and the ability to 
delegate administrative functions to the other people using the program. And 
if you subscribe to Intuit’s Advanced Inventory service, you can value inventory 
by using first in/first out (FIFO) valuation.
 TIP 	 You don’t have to pay list price for QuickBooks. Your local office supply store, Amazon, and any number of 
other retail outlets usually offer the program at a discount. (If you buy QuickBooks from Intuit, you pay full price, 
but you also have 60 days to return the program for a full refund.) In addition, accountants can resell QuickBooks 
to clients, so it’s worth asking yours about purchase and upgrade pricing. QuickBooks ProAdvisors (you can find 
a local one by going to http://proadvisor.intuit.com/find-a-proadvisor/search.jsp) can get you up to a 40 percent 
discount on QuickBooks Pro or Premier, and you’ll have 60 days to return the program for a refund.
The QuickBooks Premier Choices
If you work in one of the industries covered by QuickBooks Premier, you can get 
additional features unique to your industry. (When you install QuickBooks Premier, 
you choose the industry version you want to run. If your business is in an industry 
other than one of the five options, choose General Business.) Some people swear that 
these customizations are worth every penny, while others say the additional features 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

CHOOSING THE 
RIGHT EDITION
don’t warrant the Premier price. On the QuickBooks website (http://quickbooks.
intuit.com/premier), you can tour the Premier features to decide for yourself. Or you 
can purchase QuickBooks Accountant, which can run any QuickBooks edition, from 
QuickBooks Pro to the gamut of Premier’s industry-specific versions.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks’ Accountant edition is designed to help professional accountants and bookkeepers deliver 
services to their clients. It lets you run any QuickBooks edition (Pro or any of the Premier versions). It also lets 
you review your clients’ data and easily correct mistakes you find, transfer an accountant’s copy to your client, 
design financial statements and other documents, process payroll for clients, reconcile clients’ bank accounts, 
calculate depreciation, prepare clients’ tax returns, and work on two company files at a time.
Here are the industries that have their own Premier editions:
• The General Business edition has Premier goodies like per-item price levels, 
sales orders, and so on. It also has sales and expense forecasting, the Inventory 
Center, more built-in reports than QuickBooks Pro, and a business plan feature.
• The Contractor edition includes features near and dear to construction con­
tractors’ hearts: job-cost and other contractor-specific reports, the ability to 
set different billing rates by employee, and tools for managing change orders.
• Manufacturing & Wholesale is targeted at companies that manufacture prod­
ucts. Its chart of accounts and menus are customized for manufacturing and 
wholesale operations. You can use it to manage inventory assembled from 
components and to track customer return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) 
and damaged goods.
• If you run a nonprofit organization, you know that several things work differently 
in the nonprofit world, as the box on page xxi details. The Nonprofit edition 
of QuickBooks includes features such as a chart of accounts customized for 
nonprofits, forms and letters targeted to donors and pledges, info about using 
the program for nonprofits, and the ability to generate Statement of Functional 
Expenses 990 forms.
• The Professional Services edition (not to be confused with QuickBooks Pro) 
is designed for companies that deliver services to their clients. Unique features 
include project-costing reports, templates for proposals and invoices, billing 
rates that you can customize by client or employee, and professional service–
specific reports and help.
• The Retail edition is customized for retail businesses. It includes specialized 
menus, reports, forms, and help, as well as a custom chart of accounts. Intuit 
offers companion products that you can integrate with this edition to support 
all aspects of your retail operation. For example, QuickBooks’ Point of Sale 
product tracks sales, customers, and inventory as you ring up purchases, and 
it shoots that information over to your QuickBooks company file.

ACCOUNTING 
BASICS: THE 
IMPORTANT 
STUFF
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Nonprofit Dilemma
I’m doing the books for a tiny nonprofit corporation. I’d really 
like to avoid spending any of our hard-raised funds on a special 
edition of QuickBooks. Can’t I just use QuickBooks Pro?
You may be tempted to save some money by using QuickBooks 
Pro instead of the more expensive QuickBooks Nonprofit edi-
tion, and you can—if you’re willing to live with some limita-
tions. As long as funding comes primarily from unrestricted 
sources, the Pro edition will work reasonably well. You’ll have 
to accept using the term “customer” when you mean donor or 
member, or the term “job” for grants you receive. Throughout 
this book, you’ll find Notes and Tips about tracking nonprofit 
finances with QuickBooks Pro or Premier (the General Business 
edition—not the Nonprofit edition).
However, if you receive restricted funds or track funds by 
program, if you use QuickBooks Pro, you’ll have to manually 
post them to equity accounts and allocate them to accounts in 
your chart of accounts, since the program doesn’t automati-
cally perform these staples of nonprofit accounting. Likewise, 
QuickBooks Pro doesn’t generate all the reports you need to 
satisfy your grant providers or the government, although 
you can export reports (page 688) and then modify them 
in a spreadsheet program. In that case, QuickBooks Premier 
Nonprofit might be a real timesaver.
Accounting Basics: The Important Stuff
QuickBooks helps people who don’t have a degree in accounting handle most ac­
counting tasks. However, you’ll be more productive and have more accurate books 
if you understand the following concepts and terms:
• Double-entry accounting is the standard method for tracking where your 
money comes from and where it goes. Following the old saw that money doesn’t 
grow on trees, money always comes from somewhere when you use double-
entry accounting. For example, as shown in Table I-1, when you sell something 
to a customer, the money on your invoice comes in as income and goes into 
your Accounts Receivable account. Then, when you deposit the payment, the 
money comes out of the Accounts Receivable account and goes into your 
checking account. (See Chapter 16 for more about double-entry accounting 
and journal entries.)
 NOTE 	 Each side of a double-entry transaction is either a debit or a credit. As you can see in Table I-1, when you 
sell products or services, you credit your income account (since your income increases when you sell something), 
but debit the Accounts Receivable account (because selling something also increases how much customers owe 
you). You’ll see examples throughout the book of how transactions translate to account debits and credits.

• Chart of accounts. In bookkeeping, an account is a place to store money, just 
like your real-world checking account is a place to store your ready cash. The 
difference is that you need an account for each kind of income, expense, asset, 
and liability you have. (See Chapter 3 to learn about all the different types of 
accounts you might use.) The chart of accounts is simply a list of all the accounts 
you use to keep track of your company’s money.
• Cash vs. accrual accounting. Cash and accrual are the two different ways 
companies can document how much they make and spend. Cash accounting is 
the choice of many small businesses because it’s easy: You don’t show income 
until you’ve received a payment (regardless of when that happens), and you 
don’t show expenses until you’ve paid your bills.
The accrual method, on the other hand, follows something known as the 
matching principle, which matches revenue with the corresponding expenses. 
This approach keeps income and expenses linked to the period in which they 
happened, no matter when cash comes in or goes out. The advantage of this 
method is that it provides a better picture of profitability because income and 
its corresponding expenses appear in the same period. With accrual accounting, 
you recognize income as soon as you record an invoice, even if you’ll receive pay­
ment during the next fiscal year. For example, if you pay employees in January 
for work they did in December, those wages are part of the previous fiscal year.
• Financial reports. You need three reports to evaluate the health of your com­
pany (they’re described in detail in Chapter 17):
• The income statement, which QuickBooks calls a Profit & Loss report (page 
445), shows how much income you’ve brought in and how much you’ve 
spent over a period of time. This QuickBooks report gets its name from 
the difference between income and expenses, which results in your profit 
(or loss) for that period.
• The balance sheet (page 451) is a snapshot of how much you own and how 
much you owe. Assets are things you own that have value, such as buildings, 
equipment, and brand names. Liabilities are the money you owe to others 

INTRODUCTION
xxiii
ABOUT THIS 
BOOK
(like money you borrowed to buy one of your assets, say). The difference 
between your assets and liabilities is the equity in the company—like the 
equity you have in your house when the house is worth more than you owe 
on the mortgage.
• The statement of cash flows (page 454) tells you how much hard cash you 
have. You might think that a profit and loss report would tell you that, but 
noncash transactions—such as depreciation—prevent it from doing so. The 
statement of cash flows doesn’t include noncash transactions; it shows 
only the money generated or spent operating the company, investing in 
the company, or financing.
UP TO SPEED
Learning More about Accounting
If you need to learn a lot about QuickBooks and a little some-
thing about accounting, you’re holding the right book. But if 
bookkeeping and accounting are unfamiliar territory, some 
background training may help you use QuickBooks better 
and more easily (without calling your accountant for help 
five times a day).

About This Book
QuickBooks Help provides a healthy dose of accounting background and trouble­
shooting tips. If you don’t find the answer you need in the program’s “Have a Ques­
tion?” window (page 746), the Intuit Community—which lets you ask your peers 
and experts for answers (page 747)—or by searching with keywords, where do you 
turn next?
This book provides lots of real-world examples, and you can search for topics in its 
index. In addition, with this book, you can mark your place, underline key points, jot 
notes in the margin, or read about QuickBooks while sitting in the sun—stuff that’s 
hard to do when reading on a screen.
This book applies to the U.S. Windows version of QuickBooks Pro and Premier. 
(Because the Mac version of the program differs significantly from the Windows 
one, this book won’t be of much help if you have QuickBooks for Mac. For the same 
reason, this book doesn’t cover QuickBooks Online. Versions for other countries 
differ from the U.S. version, too, primarily in how you work with payroll and taxes.)

ABOUT THE 
OUTLINE
In these pages, you’ll find step-by-step instructions for using every QuickBooks Pro 
feature, including progress invoicing (page 284), making journal entries (page 426), 
writing off losses (page 387), handling customer refunds (page 288), and so on. If 
you’re just starting out with QuickBooks, read the first few chapters as you set up 
your company file. After that, go ahead and jump from topic to topic depending on 
the bookkeeping task at hand. As mentioned earlier, you’ll also learn about some 
of the extra bells and whistles in the QuickBooks Premier edition. (All the features 
in QuickBooks Pro—and in this book—are also in Premier.) To keep you productive, 
this book evaluates features to help you figure out which ones are most useful and 
when to use them.
 NOTE 	 Although each version of QuickBooks introduces new features and enhancements, you can still use this 
book if you’re using an earlier version. Of course, the older your version of the program, the more discrepancies 
you’ll run across.
QuickBooks 2015: The Missing Manual is designed to accommodate readers at every 
technical level. The primary discussions are written for people with beginner or 
intermediate QuickBooks skills. If you’re using QuickBooks for the first time, read 
the boxes titled “Up to Speed,” which provide the introductory info you need to 
understand the current topic. On the other hand, people with advanced skills should 
watch for similar boxes labeled “Power Users’ Clinic,” which include tips, tricks, and 
shortcuts for more experienced QuickBooks wranglers.
About the Outline
This book is divided into five parts, each containing several chapters:
• Part One: Setting Up QuickBooks explains how to set up QuickBooks based 
on your organization’s needs. These chapters cover creating a company file and 
setting up accounts, customers, jobs, vendors, invoice items, and other lists.
• Part Two: Bookkeeping follows the money from the moment you rack up time 
and expenses for your customers and add charges to a customer’s invoice to 
the tasks you have to perform at the end of the year to satisfy the IRS and other 
interested parties. These chapters describe how to track time and expenses, 
pay for things you buy, bill customers, manage the money that customers owe 
you, pay for expenses, manage your bank accounts, and perform other book­
keeping tasks.
• Part Three: Managing Your Business delves into the features that can help 
you make your company a success—or even more successful than it already 
is. These chapters explain how to keep track of the financial tasks you need to 
perform, manage QuickBooks files, keep your inventory at just the right level, 
work with sales tax, build budgets, and use QuickBooks reports to evaluate 
every aspect of your enterprise.

The Very Basics
To use this book (and QuickBooks), you need to know a few basics. This book as­
sumes that you’re familiar with the following terms and concepts:
• Clicking. This book includes instructions that require you to use your computer’s 
mouse or trackpad. To click means to point your cursor (the arrow pointer) 
at something on the screen and then—without moving the cursor—press and 
release the left button on the mouse (or laptop trackpad). To right-click means 
the same thing, but you press the right mouse button instead. (Clicking usually 
selects an onscreen element or presses an onscreen button, whereas right-
clicking typically reveals a shortcut menu, which lists some common tasks 
specific to whatever you right-clicked.) To double-click means to click the left 
button twice in rapid succession, without moving the pointer. And to drag means 
to move the cursor while holding down the left mouse button the entire time.
When you’re told to Shift-click something, you click while pressing the Shift 
key. Related procedures, like Ctrl-clicking, work the same way—just click while 
pressing the specified key.
• Menus. The menus are the words at the top of your screen: File, Edit, and so on. 
Click one to make a list of commands appear, as though they’re written on a 
window shade you’ve just pulled down. Some people click to open a menu and 
then release the mouse button; after reading the menu choices, they click the 
option they want. Other people like to press the mouse button continuously as 
they click the menu title and drag down the list to the desired command; only 
then do they release the mouse button. Both methods work, so use whichever 
you prefer.
• Keyboard shortcuts. Nothing is faster than keeping your fingers on your key­
board to enter data, choose names, trigger commands, and so on—without losing

time by grabbing your mouse, carefully positioning it, and then choosing a com­
mand or list entry. That’s why many experienced QuickBooks fans use keyboard 
shortcuts to accomplish most tasks. In this book, when you read an instruction 
like “Press Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window,” start by pressing the 
Ctrl key; while it’s down, type the letter A; and then release both keys.
About→These→Arrows
Throughout this book, and throughout the Missing Manual series, you’ll find sentences 
like this one: “Choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Customer Type List.” 
That’s shorthand for a much longer instruction that directs you to navigate three 
nested menus in sequence, like this: “At the top of your screen, click the Lists menu. 
On the Lists menu, point to the Customer & Vendor Profile Lists menu item. On the 
submenu that appears, choose Customer Type List.” Figure I-1 shows the menus 
this sequence opens.
Similarly, this arrow shorthand also simplifies the instructions for opening nested 
folders, such as Program Files→QuickBooks→Export Files.
FIGURE I-1
Instead of filling pages with 
long and hard-to-follow 
instructions for navigating 
through nested menus and 
nested folders, the arrow nota-
tion is concise and just as infor-
mative. For example, choosing 
Lists→Customer & Vendor 
Profile Lists→Customer Type 
List takes you to the menu item 
shown here.

CHAPTER
1
A 
company file is where you store your company’s financial records in Quick­
Books, so it’s the first thing you need to work on in the program. You can 
create a company file from scratch or convert records that you previously 
kept in a different small-business accounting program, Quicken, or even another 
edition of QuickBooks like QuickBooks for Mac. 
If you’re new to bookkeeping, another approach is to use a file that someone else 
created. For example, if you’ve worked with an accountant to set up your company, 
she might provide you with a QuickBooks company file already configured for your 
business so you can hit the ground running.
This chapter starts by explaining how to launch your copy of QuickBooks. Then, if you 
need to create your company file yourself, you’ll learn how to use the QuickBooks 
Setup dialog box or the EasyStep Interview to get started (and find out which other 
chapters explain how to finish the job). If you’re converting your records from another 
program, this chapter provides some hints for making the transition as smooth as 
possible. Finally, you’ll learn how to open a company file, update one to a new ver­
sion of QuickBooks, and modify basic company information.
Opening QuickBooks
Here are the easiest ways to open QuickBooks:
• Desktop icon. Double-click the desktop shortcut that QuickBooks created 
during installation.
	 	
Creating a Company File

4
BEFORE YOU 
CREATE A 
COMPANY FILE
• Windows taskbar. The fastest way to open QuickBooks is to click its icon on 
the Windows taskbar, shown in Figure 1-1—but first you have to put it there. 
To do that in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, right-click the QuickBooks desktop 
icon and then, on the shortcut menu that appears, choose “Pin to Taskbar.” If 
you’re still using Windows 8 (not 8.1), pinning the QuickBooks desktop icon to 
the taskbar takes a few more steps: Point the cursor at the screen’s upper-right 
corner to display the Charms menu, click the Search icon (the magnifying glass), 
type quickbooks in the Search box, and then press Enter. When you see the 
QuickBooks icon, right-click it, and then choose “Pin to Taskbar.”
FIGURE 1-1
Windows’ taskbar keeps your favorite icons near at hand. The taskbar 
is easy to reach, because program windows don’t hide it the way they 
do desktop shortcuts. You can rename desktop icons, as was done 
here. To do that, right-click the icon, and then choose Rename on the 
shortcut menu. Type the label you want to use, and then press Enter.
• Start menu. You can also launch QuickBooks from the Start menu. In Windows 
7, click Start→QuickBooks Pro 2015 (or QuickBooks Premier 2015). If Quick­
Books isn’t already listed in the Start menu, choose Start→All Programs→ 
QuickBooks→QuickBooks Pro 2015 (or QuickBooks Premier 2015). In Windows 
8, point the cursor at the screen’s upper-right corner to display the Charms 
menu, click Start, and then click the QuickBooks icon on the screen’s right. And 
in Windows 8.1, you can right-click the QuickBooks desktop icon and choose 
“Pin to Start.”
The first time you launch QuickBooks, you’re greeted by the QuickBooks Setup dialog 
box, whose sole purpose is to help you create a company file in one way or another. 
The rest of this chapter explains how to create a company file, and then how to 
open company files you create. After that, you’ll be ready to dive into bookkeeping.
Before You Create a Company File
If you’ve just started a business and want to inaugurate your books with QuickBooks, 
your prep work will be a snap. If, on the other hand, you have existing records for your 
business, you have a few small tasks to complete before you jump into QuickBooks’ 

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File

COMPANY FILE
setup. Whether your books are paper ledgers or electronic files in another program, 
gather your company information before you open QuickBooks. That way, you can 
hunker down in front of your computer and crank out a company file in record time. 
This section explains what you need to create a company file in QuickBooks.
Choosing a Start Date
To keep your entire financial history at your fingertips, you need to put every transac­
tion and speck of financial information in your QuickBooks company file. But you have 
better things to do than enter years’ worth of checks, invoices, and deposits, so the 
comprehensive approach is practical only if you just recently started your company.
The more realistic approach is to enter your financial data into QuickBooks starting 
as of a specific date and, from then on, add all new transactions to QuickBooks. 
The date you choose is called the start date. (The start date isn’t something that 
you enter in a field in QuickBooks; it’s simply the earliest transaction date in your 
company file.) You should choose it carefully. Here are your start date options and 
the ramifications of each one:
• The last day of the previous fiscal year. The best choice is to fill in your records 
for the entire current fiscal year. To do that, use the last day of your company’s 
previous fiscal year as the company file’s start date. That way, the account 
balances on your start date are like the ending balances on a bank statement, 
and you’re ready to start bookkeeping fresh on the first day of the fiscal year.
Yes, you have to enter checks, credit card charges, invoices, payments, and 
other transactions that have happened since the beginning of your fiscal year 
(see the box on page 6), but that won’t take as much time as you think. And 
you’ll regain those hours when tax time rolls around, as you nimbly generate 
the reports you need to complete your tax returns.
If more than half of your fiscal year has already passed, the best approach is 
to be patient and postpone your QuickBooks setup until the next fiscal year. 
(Intuit releases new versions of QuickBooks in October or November each year 
for just that reason.) But waiting isn’t always feasible. In cases like that, go with 
the next option in this list.
 TIP 	 For practice, you can start entering transactions that occur after the closing date of your bank statement 
from the month before you begin entering transactions in QuickBooks. For example, if you plan to start tracking 
your business finances in QuickBooks starting January 1, grab the bank statement whose closing date is before 
that (December 15, say). In QuickBooks, record all the transactions that occurred between that statement’s opening 
and closing dates—November 16 through December 15, in this example. Then you can practice reconciling that 
statement with your QuickBooks records (page 389).
• The last day of the previous fiscal period. The next best start date is the last 
day of the previous fiscal quarter (or fiscal month, at the very least). Since your 
company file won’t contain a full year’s worth of detail if you go this route,

you might have to switch between QuickBooks and your old filing cabinets to 
prepare your tax returns and look up financial information.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Entering History in the Right Order
If you enter transactions from the beginning of your fiscal year, 
it’s important to add them in the right order so the information 
you need is available when you need it. Here’s the order to use:
1.	 Add purchase transactions, such as purchase orders, bills, 
bill payments, checks, credit card charges, and so on. By 
entering these transactions first, you’ll have inventory 
information and reimbursable expenses ready to go when 
you start entering invoices and other sales transactions.
2.	 If you charge customers for hours worked or pay 
employees by the hour, then enter timesheet infor-
mation next. By doing so, you can create invoices or 
generate paychecks for hours worked. 
3.	 Enter sales transactions, such as sales receipts, invoices, 
and credit memos. You need these transactions in place 
before you can record customer payments or process 
sales tax.
4.	 Record customer payments and other deposits.
5.	 Record sales tax payments for the goods and services 
you sold.
6.	 If you use QuickBooks for payroll, add payroll transactions.
7.	 Enter other bank transactions, such as transfers and 
bank fees.
Account Balances and Transactions
Unless you begin using QuickBooks when you start your business, to get things 
rolling, you need to know your account balances as of your selected start date. For 
example, if your checking account has $342 at the end of the year, that value goes 
into QuickBooks during setup. You also need every transaction that’s happened since 
the start date you chose—expenses you’ve incurred, sales you’ve made, payroll and 
tax transactions, and so on—to establish your asset, liability, equity, income, and 
expense accounts. So dig that information out of your existing accounting system 
(or shoebox). (If you don’t want to record individual transactions, the box on page 
8 tells you how to quickly enter your account totals as of a specific date.)
Here are the balances and transactions you need and where you can find them in 
your records:
• Cash balances. For each bank account you use in your business (checking, 
savings, money market, and so on), find the bank statements with statement 
dates as close to—but earlier than—the start date of your QuickBooks company 
file. Hop onto your bank’s website to identify the transactions that haven’t yet 
cleared; you’ll need them to enter transactions, unless you download transac­
tions from your bank (page 617). If you have petty cash lying around, count it 
and use that number to set up your petty cash account (page 215).

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File
7
BEFORE YOU 
CREATE A 
COMPANY FILE
 TIP 	 For Subchapter C corporations, Subchapter S corporations, and partnerships, the balance sheet that you 
included with your previous year’s tax return is a great starting point for account balances. Your tax return also 
shows your federal tax ID number, which you’ll need, too.
• Customer balances. If customers owe you money, pull the paper copy of every 
unpaid invoice or statement out of your filing cabinet (or find the electronic ver­
sions you saved on your computer) so you can give QuickBooks what it needs 
to calculate your Accounts Receivable balance. If you didn’t keep copies, you 
can ask your customers for copies of the invoices they haven’t paid or simply 
create invoices in QuickBooks to match the payments you receive.
• Vendor balances. If your company thinks handing out cash before you have to 
is more painful than data entry, then find the bills you haven’t yet paid and get 
ready to enter them in QuickBooks so you can generate your Accounts Payable 
balance. (Or, to reduce the number of transactions you have to enter, simply 
pay those outstanding bills and then record the bill payments in QuickBooks.)
• Asset values. When you own assets such as buildings or equipment, their value 
depreciates over time. If you included a balance sheet with the tax return you 
filed for your company, you can find asset values and accumulated depreciation 
on your most recent tax return (yet another reason to start using QuickBooks 
at the beginning of your fiscal year). If you haven’t filed a tax return for your 
company yet, an asset’s value is typically the price you paid for it.
• Liability balances. Find the current balances you owe on any business loans 
or mortgages.
• Inventory. If you stock products that you sell and track them as inventory, you 
need to know how many items you had in stock as of the start date, how much 
you paid for them, and what you expect to sell them for.
• Payroll. Payroll services are a great value for the money, which you’ll grow to 
appreciate as you collect the info you need for payroll (including salaries and 
wages, tax deductions, benefits, pensions, 401(k) deductions, and other stray 
payroll deductions you might have). You also need to know who receives with­
holdings, such as tax agencies or the company handling your 401(k) plan. Oh, 
yeah—and you also need payroll details for each employee. Chapter 15 explains 
the payroll options available inside and outside of QuickBooks.
 TIP 	 If you have outstanding payroll withholdings such as employee payroll taxes, then send in the payments 
before you start recording transactions in QuickBooks so you don’t have to enter those open transactions in your 
company file.

WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Summarizing Midyear Account Balances
If you need to switch to QuickBooks in the middle of a fiscal 
year but don’t want to trudge through transaction data entry, 
don’t despair. A single journal entry can bring your income and 
expense account totals up to date. Although you won’t have 
the details you get from individual transactions, your account 
balances will be accurate and ready for tasks like creating 
financial reports and filing taxes.
First, you need to know your income and expense accounts’ 
totals. To get those numbers, generate an income statement 
from your previous accounting system. (Run a cash-basis or 
accrual-basis report, depending on which method you use. 
See page xxii to learn about cash versus accrual accounting.)
To record those year-to-date income and expense numbers in 
QuickBooks, create a journal entry (page 426). Fill in the Date 
field with the last day of the historical period, such as 6/30/15, 
to record financial results for the first half of the calendar 
year. In the journal entry’s table, add a line for each income 
and expense account, as shown in Figure 1-2. Finally, enter 
values for income accounts in the Credit column and values 
for expense accounts in the Debit column.
FIGURE 1-2
A journal entry that records income and expense totals 
is a compromise you can make when you must start us-
ing QuickBooks midyear. Each row in the journal entry’s 
table allocates funds to an income or expense account. 
Enter an income account total in the Credit cell. Enter an 
expense account total in the Debit cell. 
If total expense is less than total income, assign the 
leftover amount in the debit column to the Opening 
Balance Equity account. (That remaining amount is 
profit, which becomes your equity in the company, as 
described on page 454.)

Creating a Company File
Keeping books requires accuracy, attention to detail, and persistence—hence the 
customary image of spectacled accountants scanning row after row of numbers. 
QuickBooks can help you keep your books without ruining your eyesight—as long 
as you start your company file with good information. If you want to practice with 
QuickBooks, you can experiment with a sample file, as the box below explains.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Experimenting with a Sample File
You don’t have to use your real company file to test out Quick-
Books features you’ve never used. The program comes with a 
couple of sample files: one for a basic product-based business 
and one for a basic service-based business. And if you have 
QuickBooks Premier, you can experiment with several other 
sample files for more specialized pursuits like contracting, 
consulting, manufacturing, and so on.
To experiment with QuickBooks features before you put them 
into production, in the No Company Open window, click “Open a 
sample file,” and then choose the one you want. (To display the 
No Company Open window, you have to close any open com-
pany files by choosing File→Close Company [or File→Close 
Company/Logoff if there’s more than one user set up for the 
file]. If the QuickBooks Setup dialog box is open, close it, too.)
Don’t try to use one of these sample files as your actual 
company file. They come with accounts, customers, vendors, 
and transactions (such as checks, invoices, and purchase 
orders). Besides, QuickBooks sets “today’s” date in these 
files to 12/15/2019, which makes transactions later than you 
or your vendors would like (although you can edit the values 
in date boxes).
QuickBooks makes it easy to create a company file from scratch. (The box on page 
10 tells you how to find someone who can help you create one.) You can opt for 
a short and sweet process, which asks you for the bare minimum of info before it 
creates your file. Or you can use a wizard that guides you through the process with 
a series of questions that takes about 15 minutes to answer. The questions cover the 
basics of creating and customizing a company file to fit your business. QuickBooks 
needs to know some company information, the industry you’re in, and the features 
you want to use. The program then sets your preferences and creates a few accounts 
(like basic income and expense accounts and your checking account). The box on 
page 21 lists additional setup tasks you need to perform to flesh out your company 
file—and where in this book to learn more about those tasks.
Options for Creating a Company File
You can create a company file in several ways, and the QuickBooks Setup dialog 
box—which opens automatically the very first time you start QuickBooks—is your 
ticket to all of them. If you don’t see this dialog box, choose File→New Company (or 
click “Create a new company” in the No Company Open window). The dialog box 
takes up most of the screen, so you can stay focused on creating your company file.

Getting Help Creating a New Company File
The proud owners of brand-new businesses face a dilemma: 
They have more important things to do than muddle through 
setting up company files in QuickBooks, but money is usually 
as short as free time. If you don’t know much about book-
keeping or accounting, a few hours of an accountant’s time 
is a worthwhile investment when you’re getting started in 
QuickBooks. You’ll not only save untold hours, but you’ll 
also know that your books are set up properly. Accountants 
well versed in QuickBooks can create a flawless company file 
without breaking a sweat.
If you plan to do without an accountant but you want some 
help setting up your company file, you can choose Help→Find 
A Local QuickBooks Expert. By answering a few questions on 
the Local QuickBooks Expert website (http://tinyurl.com/
find-qbadvisor), you can locate someone in your area who 
can help you get started.
The three basic approaches to creating a company file are covered by the QuickBooks 
Setup dialog box’s three buttons:
• Express Start. This button is in pole position because it’s the best option if 
this is your first time creating a company file. If you go this route, QuickBooks 
holds your hand and asks for a few bits of info at a time before moving to each 
new screen. If you stop filling in information before QuickBooks creates your 
company file, the program won’t save any of the values you entered. So make 
sure you have at least 15 minutes to complete the first set of steps. Instructions 
for Express Start begin on page 11.
• Advanced Setup. If you’ve been around the QuickBooks block before, choose 
this option to launch the EasyStep Interview window, which asks for more 
information on each screen than Express Start does. If you need help during 
the process, you can always click the “Get answers” link at the top right of the 
window. You can also use Advanced Setup to go back and modify info you 
entered previously, whether you entered it using Express Start or the EasyStep 
Interview. (The instructions for the EasyStep Interview begin on page 14. If 
you’re unsure what to put in any of the fields you’re supposed to fill in, they’re 
described in the Express Start section, because you fill in much of the same 
information regardless of which approach you use.)
• Other Options. This button covers the rest of the bases. You can use it to open 
an existing company file or convert existing records that are in Quicken or an­
other accounting program (page 23) for use in QuickBooks.
 NOTE 	 If you use QuickBooks Accountant edition, you can create a company file from an existing file by 
choosing File→“New Company from Existing Company File.”

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File

CREATING A 
COMPANY FILE
Whether you use Express Start or the EasyStep Interview, you tell QuickBooks 
the basic 411 about your company, such as its name and tax ID. (If any of the fields 
confuse you, try clicking the “Need help? Give us a call” button in the QuickBooks 
Setup dialog box or the “Get answers” link in the upper-right corner of the EasyStep 
Interview window.) The next section has the full scoop on the information you need 
to provide.
Using Express Start
As its name implies, Express Start gets you going as quickly as possible by asking 
for the minimum amount of info (you can fill in the details later). To use it, choose 
File→New Company and then, in the QuickBooks Setup dialog box, click Express 
Start. The “Tell us about your business” screen appears, and you can start entering 
info. The following sections explain what the program needs to know to create your 
company file.
COMPANY INFORMATION
On the “Tell us about your business” screen, shown in Figure 1-3, you need to cough 
up only three answers, but these responses are the foundation of many of the pref­
erences that QuickBooks sets:
• Company Name. Type the name you want to appear on invoices, reports, and 
other forms. (QuickBooks also uses the name you type here to name your 
company file.) Later on, you can specify your company’s legal name (page 28).
• Industry. Start typing your industry in this box (as shown in Figure 1-3) and see 
if QuickBooks finds a match. If not, click “Help me choose” to the right of this 
field to see all your options. If you don’t see an obvious choice in the Industry 
list, then scroll to the bottom and choose either General Product-based Business 
or General Service-based Business.
Choose your industry carefully. QuickBooks adjusts its preferences and chart 
of accounts based on your choice to match how your business operates. For 
example, the program creates income and expense accounts for your type 
of business and automatically turns on features like sales tax and inventory if 
your industry typically uses them. If QuickBooks makes assumptions you don’t 
like, you can alter your preferences (Chapter 25) and accounts (page 56) later.
• Company Type. The tax form you use depends on the type of business entity 
you have. This drop-down list contains the most common types, from sole 
proprietorships and partnerships to corporations and nonprofits. When you 
select a type, QuickBooks assigns the corresponding tax form to your company 
file. After you finish creating your company file, you can see the tax form the 
program selected by choosing Company→My Company, which brings up the 
dialog box shown in Figure 1-9 (page 27). The Income Tax Form Used box at the 
bottom of that dialog box lists the tax form for your company type.

FIGURE 1-3
QuickBooks’ list of indus-
tries is robust, so chances 
are good you’ll find one 
that’s close to what your 
company does. You can 
start typing an industry, 
and the program displays 
options that match what 
you’ve typed so far, such 
as cater to display the 
industry “Restaurant, 
Caterer, or Bar” shown 
here. Or you can click the 
“Help me choose” link to 
see all the industries the 
program offers.
• Tax ID #. This box is for the federal tax ID number you use when you file taxes. 
You don’t have to enter it now, but you’ll need it come tax time. You’ll use a 
federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) if your company is a corporation 
or partnership, you have employees, or fit a few other criteria (go to www.irs.
gov to see if you need an EIN). Otherwise, your tax ID is your Social Security 
number or Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN).
• Do you have employees? The choice you make in this box doesn’t affect the 
settings in your company file. If this field is set to Yes (as it is initially) or to “No, 
but I might in the future,” then Intuit will tempt you with payroll service offers. 
If you don’t have employees or don’t want to receive those offers, choose No 
in the drop-down list.
When you finish filling out this screen, click Continue.
BUSINESS CONTACT INFORMATION
Next, you can enter your basic contact info. If you’re itching to start printing and 
emailing invoices, bills, and other forms, fill in the following fields:
• Legal Name. This is the name you use on contracts and other legal documents. 
Your company name and legal name are usually the same unless you use a DBA 
(doing business as) company name. If you own a corporation, the legal name is 
what appears on your Certificate of Incorporation.

• Contact info. Enter your mailing address, telephone number, email address, 
and website address, if you have one. The Zip and Phone fields are the only 
ones that are required.
Click Preview Your Settings to see which features QuickBooks selected for you based 
on the industry and company type you provided (Figure 1-4). The Preview Your 
Company Settings dialog box lets you fine-tune the accounts QuickBooks selected 
and choose a different place to store your company file. Here’s what you can do on 
each tab of this dialog box:
• Features Selected. This tab is purely informational. You can’t modify the set­
tings listed here, but you can change the program’s preferences later (Chapter 
25) to suit your needs.
• Chart of Accounts. This tab lists accounts typically used in your industry. The 
accounts that QuickBooks chose have checkmarks next to their names. You 
can include or exclude accounts in your chart of accounts by turning their 
checkmarks on or off.
FIGURE 1-4
You can’t use this dialog 
box to change the features 
listed on the Features 
Selected tab. However, you 
can adjust those settings 
in the Preferences dialog 
box (page 696). 
To modify the accounts 
in your company file or 
where the file is stored, 
click the Chart of Accounts 
or Company File Location 
tab, respectively.
• Company File Location. This tab shows where on your computer the program 
plans to save your company file. To choose a different spot, click Change Lo­
cation, and then select the folder you want. If the folder doesn’t exist, in the 
“Browse for Folder” dialog box, click Make New Folder, type the folder’s name, 
and then press Enter. To close the “Browse for Folder” dialog box, click OK.
When you’ve made the changes you want to your company settings, in the Preview 
Your Company Settings dialog box, click OK to return to the main QuickBooks Setup 
dialog box.

CREATING YOUR COMPANY FILE
Once everything is the way you want it, in the main QuickBooks Setup dialog box, 
click Create Company File. A Working message box appears to show QuickBooks’ 
progress in creating your file. You know it’s finished when the “You’ve got a company 
file! Now add your info” screen appears. 
If you have time, you can now add your customers, vendors, and employees; the 
products and services you sell; and your bank accounts. To learn how, jump to page 19.
Using the EasyStep Interview
The EasyStep Interview also guides you through the setup process, but it gives 
you more control over setting up your company file than Express Start does. For 
example, you can provide more info about your company up front and choose which 
features to turn on.
To access the EasyStep Interview, choose File→New Company and then, in the 
QuickBooks Setup dialog box, click Advanced Setup. The “Enter your company 
information” screen appears. As you enter the following info, click Next to proceed 
to each new screen:
• Name and contact info. The first screen wants to know the name of your com­
pany, its legal name, its tax ID, and your contact info. The “Company name” 
field is the only one that’s required—you can fill in the other fields later on as 
described on page 26.
• Industry. On the “Select your industry” screen, choose the industry closest to 
yours. That way, most of the settings the program chooses will be what you want.
• Type of company. On the “How is your company organized?” screen, select the 
option for your company type. This setting determines which tax form, accounts, 
and tax form lines you’ll use to prepare your business tax return.
• First month of fiscal year. When you start a company, you choose a fiscal year. 
On the “Select the first month of your fiscal year” screen, QuickBooks auto­
matically sets the “My fiscal year starts in” box to January because so many 
businesses stick with the calendar year for simplicity. If you start your fiscal 
year in another month, choose it from the drop-down list.
• Administrator password. The administrator can do absolutely anything in your 
company file: set up other users, log in as other users, and access any area of 
the company file. Although QuickBooks lets you click Next and skip right past 
the “Set up your administrator password” screen, this is no time for shortcuts, 
as the box on page 15 explains. Type the password you want to use in both the 
“Administrator password” and “Retype password” boxes, and then keep the 
password in a safe but memorable place. (Page 718 explains how to change the 
administrator name and password.)

Safe Login Practices
Don’t even think about having everyone who works with a 
company file share one login. You don’t want everyone to 
have access to payroll data, and you wouldn’t know which 
person to fire if you found any less-than-legal transactions 
in the file. Even if you run a small business from home, an 
administrator password prevents the chimney sweep from 
swiping your business credit card number. Chapter 28 has 
much more about keeping your QuickBooks files secure, but 
here are some password basics:
• Choose a password that’s at least eight characters long 
and is a combination of letters and numbers.
• Passwords are case sensitive, so make sure that Caps 
Lock isn’t turned on by mistake. 
• Type the password in both the “Administrator password” 
and “Retype password” boxes. If you copy and paste the 
password from one box to the other, you could copy a typo 
and not be able to open the company file you just created.
If you forget the administrator login and password or lose the 
piece of paper they’re written on, you won’t be able to open 
your company file without some fancy footwork, so keep a 
record of them someplace safe. If you’ve tried everything and 
your administrator password is still missing in action, see page 
720 to learn how to reset it.
CREATING YOUR COMPANY FILE
After you set the administrator password and click Next, the “Create your company 
file” screen appears. (If you’re new to QuickBooks, click the “Where should I save 
my company file?” link, which opens a Help Article dialog box that explains the pros 
and cons of storing company files in different places.)
When you’re ready to create the file, on the “Create your company file” screen, 
click Next to wrap up the creation process by specifying the filename and location. 
QuickBooks opens the “Filename for New Company” dialog box, which is really just 
a Save As dialog box. Navigate to the folder where you want to store your company 
file. QuickBooks automatically sets the “File name” box to the company name you 
entered, and the “Save as type” box to “QuickBooks Files (*.QBW, *.QBA).” Here are 
some guidelines for naming and saving your company file:
• If you want to call the file something other than the company name you entered 
earlier in the interview, simply type a new name in the “File name” box. For ex­
ample, you may want one that’s shorter or that better identifies the company’s 
records within.
• Consider storing your company file in a folder with the rest of your company 
data so that it gets backed up along with everything else. For example, if you’re 
the only person who uses QuickBooks, you could create a Company Files folder 
inside your Documents folder. See page 742 for more about choosing a location 
for company files.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
16
CREATING A 
COMPANY FILE
When you click Save in the “Filename for New Company” dialog box, QuickBooks 
may take a minute or so to create the new file. In the meantime, a message box 
with a progress bar appears. When the company file is ready, the “Customizing 
QuickBooks for your business” screen appears. Click Next to dig in.
 TIP 	 At this point, the progress bar in the left margin of the EasyStep Interview window is depressingly short 
because you still have to do the bulk of the company file setup. If you need a break before continuing, click Leave 
at the bottom of the window. The next time you open that company file, the EasyStep Interview continues where 
you left off.
CUSTOMIZING YOUR COMPANY FILE
Click Next on the “Customizing QuickBooks for your business screen” to see a se­
ries of EasyStep Interview screens that ask questions about your business to help 
QuickBooks decide which features to turn on, what to include on your Home Page, 
and so on. The interview displays “(recommended for your business)” next to the 
options that are typical for a company in your industry, as shown in Figure 1-5.
FIGURE 1-5
The EasyStep Interview 
sticks to the basics, so 
you’ll have more setup 
to do later. As you step 
through the screens in this 
section, make a list of the 
features you’re turning 
on (and the correspond-
ing page numbers in this 
book) for reference. If 
you decide to change any 
of these settings later, 
Chapter 25 tells you how.
Here are some guidelines for answering the questions on the various screens:
• The What do you sell? screen is where you tell QuickBooks whether you offer 
services, products, or both. When you choose one of these options, the program 
figures out which types of income accounts you need. If you select “Products 
only” or “Both services and products,” another screen later in the interview asks 
whether you want to track inventory.
• The Do you charge sales tax? screen has only two options: Yes and No. If you’re 
one of the unfortunate souls who has to navigate the rocky shoals of sales tax, 
select Yes. If you don’t charge sales tax, select No. For detailed instructions on 
dealing with sales tax in QuickBooks, see Chapter 21.

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File
17
CREATING A 
COMPANY FILE
• On the Do you want to create estimates in QuickBooks? screen, choose Yes or 
No to turn the estimate feature on or off. If you prepare quotes, bids, or estimates 
for your customers and want to do so in QuickBooks (page 278), select Yes.
 NOTE 	 If you use QuickBooks Premier, the “Tracking customer orders in QuickBooks” screen appears, asking 
whether you want to use sales orders to track backorders (page 261) or other orders that you plan to fill at a later 
date. QuickBooks Pro doesn’t include sales orders.
• The Using statements in QuickBooks screen is where you tell the program 
whether you generate statements to send to customers (page 295). For example, 
your wine-of-the-month club might send monthly statements to its members. 
Or if you’re a consultant, you could send invoices for work performed and then 
send a statement that summarizes the fees, payments, and outstanding balance.
• The Using invoices in QuickBooks screen appears only if you chose No on the 
“Do you want to create estimates in QuickBooks?” screen. (If you chose Yes on 
that screen, QuickBooks automatically turns on the invoicing feature.) Select 
Yes to tell the program that you want to use invoices, which you probably do 
because invoices are the most flexible sales forms (page 222). If you answer 
No (if, for example, you own a restaurant), QuickBooks jumps to the “Managing 
bills you owe” screen.
• If you answer Yes on the “Using invoices in QuickBooks” screen, the Using 
progress invoicing screen asks whether you invoice customers based on the 
percentage you’ve completed on a job. See page 284 to learn why (and how) 
you might use this feature.
• The Managing bills you owe screen asks whether you plan to write checks 
to pay bills immediately (select No) or enter bills in QuickBooks and then pay 
them later (select Yes). You can read about bill preferences on page 638 and 
payment preferences on page 657.
 TIP 	 Entering bills in QuickBooks (page 186) requires more steps than simply writing checks without entering 
the bills in QuickBooks, but there’s a benefit to the extra effort: The program can remind you when bills are due 
or qualify for timely payment discounts, and it can keep track of the total you owe.
• The Tracking inventory in QuickBooks screen is where you tell the program 
whether you keep track of the products you have in stock. This screen provides 
a few examples of when to track or bypass inventory, and page 99 has info 
about how to decide whether tracking inventory makes sense for your business.
• Tracking time in QuickBooks is ideal if you bill by the hour or pay people based 
on the number of hours they work. In that case, select Yes on this screen to track 
the hours people work and create invoices for their time. Chapter 8 explains 
how to set up time tracking.

• The Do you have employees? screen is where you specify whether you want 
to use QuickBooks’ payroll and 1099 features. If you do, select Yes and turn on 
the appropriate checkbox(es). If you use non-Intuit services to run payroll or to 
generate contractors’ 1099s, select No.
When you click Next on the “Do you have employees?” screen, you see the “Using 
accounts in QuickBooks” screen, and the progress bar indicates that you’re almost 
done with the interview. Click Next to set these final options:
• The Select a date to start tracking your finances screen summarizes what 
you learned about start dates on page 5. To start at the beginning of this fiscal 
year (which QuickBooks can figure out using the current calendar year and the 
starting month you select), choose the “Beginning of this fiscal year: 01/01/15” 
option. (The year you see listed depends on the current calendar year.) If you’ve 
decided to start on a different date, select the “Use today’s date or the first day 
of the quarter or month” option instead. You can then type or choose any date 
you want in the box, such as the last day of the previous fiscal period.
• The Review income and expense accounts screen (Figure 1-6) lists the ac­
counts typically used by companies in your industry.
FIGURE 1-6
QuickBooks places a 
checkmark in front of the 
accounts that are typical 
for your industry. Click an 
empty checkmark cell to 
add an account that the 
program didn’t select, or 
click a cell with a check-
mark to turn that account 
off. You can also drag your 
cursor over checkmark 
cells to turn several ac-
counts on or off.
When you click Next, you see a bright orange—but premature—”Congratulations!” 
You still have a few more steps to complete before you can open your company file. 
Click “Go to Setup,” and then read the next section.
Beginning to Use QuickBooks
After you create your company file with Express Start or the EasyStep Interview, 
you’ll see the “You’ve got a company file!” screen, which is where you perform the 

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File
19
CREATING A

additional steps you have to complete, such as adding people you do business with, 
items you sell, and bank accounts.
If you want to dive into your work without QuickBooks’ help on these steps, click 
Start Working at the window’s bottom right and jump to page 20. If you want step-
by-step guidance through these processes, click the Add buttons in these sections 
(if your lists already contain people and items, you’ll see Add More buttons instead):
• Add the people you do business with. Adding these folks is a snap. Click the 
first Add button, and then you can import names from your email program 
(Outlook, Yahoo, or Gmail), paste data from an Excel workbook, or enter info 
manually. If you select one of the import options and then click Continue, you’ll 
see a table with the names from your email program, as shown in Figure 1-7.
FIGURE 1-7
Initially, QuickBooks 
selects the Skip option 
(the far-left column) for 
all the names. That way, 
you can select the option 
in the Customer, Vendor, or 
Employee column for each 
name you want to import 
to designate whether it’s a 
customer, vendor, or em-
ployee. You can also select 
a cell with info in it (like a 
name or an email address) 
and edit the info.
• Add the products and services you sell. When you click the Add (or Add More) 
button in this section, you first choose either the Service or “Non-inventory 
part” option, because you fill in different fields for each type of item. Select the 
Service option to set up services you sell or the “Non-inventory part” option 
to create products you sell (see page 517 to learn about products you keep in 
inventory), and then click Continue. Fill in the names, description, and prices, 
and then click Continue again to save your items.
• Add your bank accounts. For bank accounts, you fill in the account name, ac­
count number, opening balance, and opening balance date.

Converting from Another Program to 
QuickBooks
If you launched your small business from your basement and kept your records with 
Quicken Home & Business, your accountant has probably recommended that you 
make the leap to QuickBooks. Or maybe you used another accounting program like 
Peachtree or Small Business Accounting and have decided to move to QuickBooks. 
Or perhaps you’re switching from QuickBooks for Mac to QuickBooks for Windows. 
Whatever your situation, this section tells you how to prep your file for a smooth 
conversion and bring it over into QuickBooks for Windows.
Converting from Quicken Home & Business
Quicken doesn’t report your business performance in the way that most accountants 
want to see, nor does it store your business transactions the way QuickBooks does. 
Bottom line: You have to prep your Quicken file before you convert it to QuickBooks.
CLEANING UP YOUR QUICKEN FILE
To make the conversion proceed as smoothly as possible, some cleanup of your 
Quicken file is in order. For example, record overdue scheduled transactions and 
send online payments before you convert your Quicken file. Also, in Quicken, de­
lete accounts you no longer need, because once they’re in QuickBooks, you can’t 
delete them if they contain any transactions. And make sure that customer names 
are consistent and unique. 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
22
CONVERTING 
FROM 
ANOTHER 
PROGRAM TO 
QUICKBOOKS
QuickBooks doesn’t support repeating online payments, so you also have to tell 
Quicken to delete any repeating online payments you’ve set up. In addition, you 
need complete reports of your past payrolls because Quicken payroll transactions 
don’t convert to QuickBooks.
Intuit publishes a detailed guide to help you prepare for a Quicken conversion. Go 
to http://tinyurl.com/pu6vntq and follow the instructions there.
CONVERTING YOUR QUICKEN FILE
When your Quicken file is ready for conversion to QuickBooks, you have two op­
tions in QuickBooks:
• Choose File→New Company. In the QuickBooks Setup dialog box, click Other 
Options, and then choose Convert Quicken Data.
• Choose File→Utilities→Convert→From Quicken.
 NOTE 	 If you cleaned up your Quicken file but you run into conversion problems in QuickBooks, check the 
QuickBooks company file for errors by choosing File→Utilities→Verify Data, as described on page 507. Another 
potential solution is to remove transactions prior to the current fiscal year in Quicken before converting the file. If 
nothing you try works and you’re willing to send your Quicken file to Intuit, contact QuickBooks technical support 
by choosing Help→Support. A browser window opens to the Intuit QuickBooks Support page. In the horizontal 
navigation bar, click Contact Us. QuickBooks may agree to convert the file for you (for a fee).
FINE-TUNING YOUR CONVERTED QUICKEN DATA
Now that your Quicken data is resting comfortably in a QuickBooks file, you might 
think you’re ready to start using QuickBooks. However, there are some post-
conversion steps you should take to get your newly minted company file into shape:
• Enter your company information in QuickBooks. Info like your company’s 
legal name and address, federal Employer Identification Number, and business 
type don’t come over with your Quicken data. See page 26 to learn how to add 
them to your company file.
• Set up your bank feeds in QuickBooks. Page 610 tells you how to get your 
QuickBooks bank accounts and your real-world bank accounts talking.
• Change Quicken names to QuickBooks customers, vendors, and employ­
ees. When you convert from Quicken to QuickBooks, QuickBooks adds all the 
converted names to its Other Names List. See page 148 to learn how to move 
these names to other lists.
 TIP 	 If your Quicken data file has tons of names, an easy way to convert them is to export them to a spreadsheet 
and then import them using QuickBooks’ Add/Edit Multiple List Entries feature (page 124).

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File
23
OPENING AN 
EXISTING 
COMPANY FILE
• Set up Accounts Payable in QuickBooks. If your Quicken file contained unpaid 
bills, simply write checks (page 202) to pay them in QuickBooks. Once your 
vendor balances are zero, you’re ready to enter new bills in QuickBooks. When 
you record your first bill, the program automatically adds a new account called 
Accounts Payable to your chart of accounts.
Converting from QuickBooks for Mac
Moving a file from QuickBooks for Mac to QuickBooks for Windows is mainly about 
getting the file into a QuickBooks for Windows format. To do that, simply create a 
backup of the file in QuickBooks for Mac, and then restore that backup (page 501) 
in QuickBooks for Windows.
Converting from a Non-Intuit Program
To convert files created in other accounting programs, like Peachtree or Small Busi­
ness Accounting, you have to download a conversion tool from the Intuit website. 
In QuickBooks, choose File→Utilities→Convert, and then choose the program you 
want to convert from. In the browser window that opens, scroll down to the “Are 
you ready to convert your data?” section, click the “Convert from Peachtree, Micro­
soft SBA, & Microsoft Office Accounting” link, and then click the Download button 
that appears. In the File Download dialog box that opens, click Save to download 
QuickBooksConversionToolSetup.exe to your computer.
Opening an Existing Company File
After you’ve opened a company file in one QuickBooks session, the next time you 
launch the program, it automatically opens that same company file. If you keep the 
books for only one company, you might never have to manually open a QuickBooks 
company file again.
But if you’re an irrepressible entrepreneur or a bookkeeper who works on several 
companies’ books, you can open another company file in QuickBooks anytime, and 
the program automatically closes the previous one. Because QuickBooks stores data 
in a database, you don’t have to save a company file before you close it. (And if you 
use QuickBooks Accountant edition, you can have two company files open at the 
same time, as the Tip below explains.) The following sections describe the different 
ways to open a company file.
 TIP 	 With QuickBooks Accountant and QuickBooks Enterprise, you can have two company files open at the 
same time, although the second file that you open has some restrictions. (To learn about these restrictions, search 
QuickBooks Help for “second company.”) To open a second company file, choose File→Open Second Company, 
and your computer launches a new instance of QuickBooks. In the new window, double-click the name of the file 
you want to open. The second company file opens with the text “(Secondary)” after the company name in the 
QuickBooks window’s title bar. (In the first QuickBooks window, the text “(Primary)” appears after the company 
name.)

Opening a Recently Opened Company File
If you work on more than one company file, you may frequently switch between 
them. The easiest way to open a recent file is to choose File→Open Previous Com­
pany, and then choose the file you want to open, as shown in Figure 1-8. If the Open 
Previous Company submenu doesn’t list the file you want, follow the steps in the 
next section instead.
FIGURE 1-8
To open a company file 
you’ve worked on recently, 
click it in the Open Previ-
ous Company submenu. 
If the No Company Open 
window (not shown here) 
is visible, you can open a 
recent file by double-
clicking its filename in that 
window’s list. (Opening 
a sample file is the only 
task the No Company Open 
window performs that you 
can’t also perform via the 
File menu.)
Opening Any Company File
Sometimes, a company file you want to open falls off the recent-file list. (The box on 
page 25 explains how to tell QuickBooks how many files to include on the File→Open 
Previous Company submenu.) Say your bookkeeping business is booming and you 
work on dozens of company files every month. Or maybe you want to update a file 
from a previous version of QuickBooks (see the box on page 26). Here’s how to open 
any company file, no matter how long it’s been since you last used it:
1.	 Choose File→“Open or Restore Company.”
If the No Company Open window is visible, you can click “Open or restore an 
existing company” instead.
2.	 In the “Open or Restore Company” dialog box, select the “Open a company 
file” option, and then click Next.
QuickBooks closes your current company file and then opens the “Open a 
Company” dialog box.

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File
25
OPENING AN 
EXISTING 
COMPANY FILE
3.	 Navigate to the folder with the company file you want and double-click 
the file’s name.
You can also click the filename and then click Open.
4.	 If the QuickBooks Login window appears (which it will if you’ve assigned a 
password to the Administrator user account or set up multiple users), type 
your user name and password.
If the Administrator is the only user, the Password box is the only one that ap­
pears. But if you have more than one user for the company file, both the User 
Name and Password boxes appear.
5.	 Click OK.
QuickBooks opens the company file, and you’re ready to keep the books.
 NOTE 	 Backup files are the answer to the adrenaline rush you get when you do something dumb with your 
company file, when your hard drive crashes, or when a plume of smoke wafts up from your computer. To learn 
how to create or restore backup files, see page 495 or page 501, respectively.
ORGANIZATION STATION
Fast Access to Several Companies
If you work on several sets of company books at the same time, 
choosing File→Open Previous Company is the quickest way to 
hop between company files. 
Out of the box, QuickBooks lists up to 20 companies on this 
submenu (it lists them starting with the most recent). If you 
work with fewer companies, the submenu may have company 
files that you’d rather forget. You can change the number of 
companies QuickBooks lists on this submenu to match the num-
ber of companies you work with. With a clever workaround, 
you can also clear out old entries that you don’t want to see.
Here’s how to change the number of companies on the Open 
Previous Company submenu:
1.	 Make sure you have a company file open, and then 
choose File→Open Previous Company→“Set number 
of previous companies.” 
2.	 In the “Set Number of Previous Companies” dialog box, 
type the maximum number of companies you want to see 
on the submenu, and then click OK. 
3.	 To clear old entries off the menu, change the number of 
entries to 1, and then click OK. After you do so, QuickBooks 
lists only the most recent company file, clearing all the 
others off the list.
4.	 If you want to see more than one company, reset the 
number of entries again, this time to a higher number. 
Now, when you open another company file, it will appear 
on the list.
Opening a Portable Company File
A portable file is a special type of file that makes QuickBooks company files compact 
so you can email them more easily. These files take up less space because they don’t 
contain other files related to your company file, like letters, templates, logos, and 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
26
MODIFYING 
COMPANY INFO
images. A portable file also doesn’t contain a transaction log (.tlg file), which Intuit 
Technical Support can use to restore transactions if your file is damaged in some way.
Opening a portable file is similar to opening a regular company file:
1.	 Choose File→“Open or Restore Company.”
The “Open or Restore Company” dialog box opens.
2.	 Select the “Restore a portable file” option, and then click Next.
The Open Portable Company File dialog box appears. QuickBooks automatically 
sets the “Files of type” box to “QuickBooks Portable Company Files (*.QBM).”
3.	 Navigate to the folder with the portable file and double-click its filename.
QuickBooks opens the file.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Updating a QuickBooks File
How do I update a company file to the newest version of 
QuickBooks?
If you’ve used a previous version of QuickBooks, your company 
file is set up to work with that version. When you upgrade to 
QuickBooks 2015, the program has to make some changes to 
your company file.
Once you update a company file, your coworkers won’t be able 
to open it until you install QuickBooks 2015 on their computers. 
So to prevent work disruptions, plan to upgrade all copies of 
QuickBooks and the company file during downtime.
Fortunately, updating a company file is easy: All you have to 
do is open it in the new version of QuickBooks and follow the 
onscreen instructions. Here are the steps:
1.	 In your new version of QuickBooks, choose File→“Open 
or Restore Company.”
2.	 In the “Open or Restore Company” dialog box, select 
the “Open a company file” option, and then click Next. 
3.	 In the “Open a Company” dialog box, double-click the 
company file you want to update. If you see the User Name 
and Password box, enter your user name and password.
4.	 In the “Update Company File for New Version” dialog box, 
turn on the “I understand that my company file will be 
updated to this new version of QuickBooks” checkbox, 
and then click Update Now.
5.	 Click OK to create a backup before you upgrade. Follow 
the steps to create a backup copy of your company file 
(page 495).
6.	 When the Update Company message box appears, click 
Yes to start the update. Keep in mind that this process 
could take a while if your company file is large or if you’re 
updating from several QuickBooks versions back.
Modifying Company Info
When you use Express Start or the EasyStep Interview, QuickBooks gets the basic 
facts about your company in small chunks spread over several screens. But after 
you create your company file, you can easily view and edit any of this information. 
Here’s how:

Chapter 1: Creating a Company File
27
MODIFYING 
COMPANY INFO
1.	 Choose Company→My Company or click the My Company entry in the icon 
bar (page 30).
The My Company window opens. As shown in Figure 1-9 (background), info 
about your copy of QuickBooks appears on the window’s left and your com­
pany info appears on the right. Apps, services, and subscriptions that you’ve 
signed up for (like accepting credit cards, payroll, and so on) appear below 
your company info. Other products that Intuit would like to sell you appear at 
the bottom of the window.
2.	 To edit your company info, click the edit icon at the window’s top right (it 
looks like a pencil).
The Company Information dialog box opens with your company information 
grouped into several categories (see Figure 1-9, foreground).
FIGURE 1-9
Some bits of company 
information change more 
often than others. For 
instance, you might relo-
cate your office or change 
your phone number, 
email address, or website 
address. But stuff like your 
company’s legal name and 
address, federal Employer 
Identification Number, and 
business type (corpora-
tion, sole proprietorship, 
and so on) usually stays 
the same.
3.	 To edit your company’s contact info, in the Company Information dialog 
box, click the Contact Information category on the left, and then make the 
changes you want.
This category includes fields for your company address, phone number, email 
address, and website.

COMPANY INFO
4.	 To change your company’s legal name and address, click the Legal Infor­
mation category.
Remember, your company’s legal name and address are the ones you use on 
federal and state tax forms.
5.	 To edit the tax identification number you use, click the Company Identifica­
tion category.
This category includes the federal Employee Identification Number (EIN) and 
Social Security Number (SSN) fields. Fill in (or edit) the one that you use for 
your company.
6.	 To specify info for reports you generate, click the Report Information 
category.
You can specify the starting month for both your fiscal year and your tax year. 
In addition, this category is where you set the tax form you use for your com­
pany tax return.
7.	 If you have payroll, click the Payroll Tax Form Information category and 
make the changes you want.
You can fill in the name, title, and phone number for the person who prepares 
and signs your company payroll forms, so QuickBooks can fill those fields in 
automatically when you use an Intuit payroll service.
8.	 When you’re done editing, click OK.
The Company Information dialog box closes. Click the X at the top right of the 
My Company window to close it, too.

ou have more than enough to do running your business, so you don’t want 
bookkeeping to take any more time than necessary. QuickBooks’ icon bar 
(which comes in two flavors: left and top) offers shortcuts to your favorite 
features. Each version of the icon bar has its pros and cons, so you have to decide 
which one you prefer (or you can hide them). This chapter shows you how to access 
QuickBooks’ features from both the menu bar and icon bars.
During a rousing bookkeeping session, you might end up with several QuickBooks 
windows open at the same time. In this chapter, you learn how to work with all the 
windows you open. For example, if you prefer to focus on one task, you can tell 
QuickBooks to display only one window at a time.
Another way to get your accounting done quickly and efficiently is by accessing fea­
tures via the QuickBooks Home Page. This page not only provides a visual roadmap 
of the bookkeeping tasks you perform regularly, but it also gives you quick access 
to tasks and information related to vendors, customers, and employees, along with 
the features and overall financial info you use most often. Click an icon, and the 
corresponding window or dialog box appears, such as Chart of Accounts, Item List, 
Write Checks, or everyone’s favorite—Make Deposits. 
This chapter explains how to use the workflow icons on the Home Page, as well 
as the Vendor, Customer, and Employees Centers that open when you click the 
corresponding buttons in the Home Page’s panels. (The Inventory Center, which is 
available in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise, is described on page 538.) You’ll 
also see how to review your company’s finances in the Company Snapshot window 
and the Home window’s new Insights tab.

MENUS AND 
THE ICON BAR
Menus and the Icon Bar
The menu bar at the very top of the QuickBooks window (Figure 2-1) is a convenient 
way to launch different activities. It’s handy because it’s always visible and serves 
up every feature the program has to offer.
FIGURE 2-1
Every feature in Quick-
Books is always within 
reach via the menu bar. 
Choose a top-level menu 
like Customers (as shown 
here), and then choose an 
entry from the drop-down 
menu or a submenu. 
For one-click access to 
your favorite features, use 
the left icon bar (visible 
here) or top icon bar, both 
of which you can custom-
ize to include the features 
and reports you use the 
most (page 700).
You can use the View menu to choose between two versions of the icon bar: top 
and left. The top icon bar (View→Top Icon Bar) has been around for years. If you 
haven’t graduated to a large, widescreen monitor, this icon bar is both convenient 
and space-saving. (If you really need more space, you can hide the icon bar by 
choosing View→Hide Icon Bar.) It sits just below the menu bar and displays your 
favorite features as icons with brief identifying labels. Click an icon, such as Home, 
Calendar, or Bill, and the corresponding feature launches. 
The left icon bar (View→Left Icon Bar), shown in Figure 2-2, appears the first time 
you launch QuickBooks 2015. The categories in the middle section of this icon bar 

Chapter 2: Getting Around in QuickBooks
31
MENUS AND 
THE ICON BAR
determine what’s displayed in its top section. Here’s what the entries in the middle 
section of the left icon bar do:
• My Shortcuts. This category, which appears at the top of the left icon bar 
whenever you launch QuickBooks, is a great way to keep your favorite features 
within easy reach. Out of the box, this category includes features that most 
people use frequently. But you can add other features you use all the time and 
get rid of shortcuts you don’t use simply by right-clicking anywhere within the 
My Shortcuts section (except on the My Shortcuts heading), and then clicking 
Customize Shortcuts.
FIGURE 2-2
The left icon bar includes 
three sections that help 
you access your favorite 
features. 
The unlabeled middle 
section contains categories 
like My Shortcuts and View 
Balances. When you click 
an option in this section, 
the top section displays 
the entries for that 
category, like the shortcuts 
shown here. 
The bottom section 
contains links to other 
products and services 
that Intuit offers, such 
as payroll and merchant 
credit card services.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
32
MENUS AND 
THE ICON BAR
 NOTE 	 The shortcuts in the My Shortcuts list are the same ones you see as icons if you display the top icon 
bar.
• View Balances. When you use the left icon bar, the Home Page doesn’t display 
account balances on its right side as it does when you use the top icon bar. To 
see your account balances at the top of the left icon bar, click this category. 
(Page 699 explains how to customize which account balances you see.)
• Run Favorite Reports. Clicking this category lists the reports that you’ve 
flagged as your favorites (page 579). The reports you see are the same ones 
that appear when you choose Reports→Favorite Reports or display the Report 
Center’s Favorites tab.
• Open Windows. If you turn on the preference to use multiple windows (page 
643), you can click this category to see a list of open windows at the top of the 
left icon bar. Click a window’s name to make it active. This category displays 
the same windows you see if you choose View→Open Window List when using 
the top icon bar.
 TIP 	 The left icon bar takes up a couple of inches on the left side of the main QuickBooks window, so it’s 
more useful if you have a widescreen monitor. With older and smaller monitors, you’ll have trouble fitting the 
left icon bar and your transaction windows onscreen at the same time. In that case, the menu bar, top icon bar, 
and Home Page (which you’ll learn about in a sec) are ready to assist you.
After shortcut menus (which you display by right-clicking things) and keyboard 
shortcuts (which you can read about in online Appendix C, available at www.
missingmanuals.com/cds), the icon bar is the fastest way to launch your favorite 
features. As page 700 explains, you can customize the icon bar to add features, 
memorized reports, and windows you open often—and remove features you don’t 
use. 
Resizing Drop-Down Lists and Columns
Throughout QuickBooks, you can resize drop-down lists to change their heights and 
widths. This comes in handy, for example, when you want to see your customers’ full 
names in a Customer:Job List drop-down list or view more accounts in an account 
drop-down list so you don’t have to scroll as much to locate the account you want. 
You can also resize columns in transaction windows’ tables so you can read more of 
those columns’ contents. For example, you might widen the Memo column on the 
Enter Bills window’s Expenses tab while narrowing the Amount column.
Here’s what you do:
• To resize a drop-down list, open it, and then put your cursor over the dots in 
the list’s lower-right corner (circled in Figure 2-3). When the cursor changes to 
a two-headed arrow, drag to adjust the list’s width and height.

Chapter 2: Getting Around in QuickBooks
33
SWITCHING 
AMONG OPEN 
WINDOWS
• To change the widths of columns in a table, place your cursor over the vertical 
dots between two column headings (also circled in Figure 2-3), and then drag 
left or right to shrink or widen the column to the left.
FIGURE 2-3
Resizable drop-down lists 
include a triangle made of 
dots below their scrollbars 
(circled, left). When you 
put your cursor over 
these dots, it changes to a 
two-headed arrow, which 
is your cue that you can 
drag to resize the drop-
down list. 
The same technique works 
with the vertical dots 
between columns in a 
table (circled, right): Place 
your cursor over the dots, 
and then drag left or right 
to resize the column to 
the left.
Switching among Open Windows
If you tend to work on one bookkeeping task for hours on end, you can set Quick­
Books up to display one full-size window at a time by choosing View→One Window. 
That way, when you open additional windows, they get stacked on top of one another 
so you see only the last one you opened.
If you go with the one-window approach, you have several ways to choose the 
window you want to see:
• In the middle section of the left icon bar, click Open Windows as shown in 
Figure 2-4. Then, in the top section of the left icon bar, click the name of the 
window you want.
• If you use the top icon bar, you can see a list of open windows by choosing 
View→Open Window List. Then, in the list, simply click the name of the window 
you want to work with.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
34
SWITCHING 
AMONG OPEN 
WINDOWS
• On the menu bar, choose Window, and then choose the name of the one you 
want to see.
FIGURE 2-4
You can switch to another 
window by clicking the 
Window menu at the top 
of the screen and then 
choosing the window you 
want to display. 
When you have mul-
tiple windows open, the 
Window menu includes 
entries for arranging them, 
such as Cascade and Tile 
Vertically.
If, on the other hand, you flit between bookkeeping tasks like a honeybee in an alfalfa 
field, you probably want to display several windows at a time. QuickBooks can do 
that: just choose View→Multiple Windows. 
Like windows in other programs, simply click a window to bring it to the front, or use 
the buttons in its upper right to minimize, maximize, or close it. You can reposition 
windows by dragging their title bars or resize them by dragging their edges and 
corners. If the window you want is hidden behind other windows, choose the one 
you want in the Open Windows List or from the Window menu on the menu bar.
Supermax View
When you want to see as much information as possible in a transaction window, 
such as Create Invoices, Supermax view, shown in Figure 2-5, is just the ticket. To 
switch a transaction window to Supermax mode, at the window’s top right, click 
the four-headed arrow.

Chapter 2: Getting Around in QuickBooks
35
THE HOME 
PAGE
FIGURE 2-5
Supermax view hides the 
menu bar, the icon bar, 
and the ribbon at the top 
of the transaction window. 
It also hides the transac-
tion history panel on the 
window’s right side. 
You can restore or hide 
the ribbon and transaction 
history panel by clicking 
the appropriate icons at 
the window’s top right 
(labeled).
This view does several things so you can see more of the data-entry lines:
• Hides the QuickBooks menu bar and (if you use it) the icon bar.
• Minimizes the ribbon (which is similar to the ribbons in Microsoft programs) at 
the top of the transaction window.
• Fills the entire QuickBooks window with the transaction window you 
Supermaxed.
• Hides the transaction history panel on the window’s right side.
To revert to regular window mode, click the icon that looks like a square with an 
arrow pointing to its lower left (labeled in Figure 2-5). When you revert to regular 
window mode, the menu bar, icon bar, and feature panel at the top of the transac­
tion window all reappear.
The Home Page
The QuickBooks Home Page (Figure 2-6, background) is a slick way to work through 
your company’s bookkeeping tasks in the right order. (If it isn’t visible, display it by 
choosing Company→Home Page or clicking Home in the left icon bar’s My Short­
cuts section.) This section explains how to use the Home Page to best advantage.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
36
THE HOME 
PAGE
FIGURE 2-6
If a feature you use 
doesn’t appear on the 
Home Page, choose 
Edit→Preferences→ 
Desktop View, and then 
click the Company Prefer-
ences tab (foreground). 
For example, if you want 
to enter sales receipts, 
turn on the Sales Receipts 
checkbox, as shown here. 
Some features (like 
Estimates and Sales Tax) 
have their own section 
of preferences. At the 
bottom of the Company 
Preferences tab, the Re-
lated Preferences section 
includes links you can click 
to jump to the correspond-
ing preferences.
The settings you chose when you created your company file determine what initially 
appears on the Home Page. Depending on your choices, you’ll see several pan­
els—Vendors, Customers, Employees, Company, and Banking—that each contain 
various icons. For example, if you told QuickBooks that you invoice customers and 
send statements, the Customers panel includes icons for invoicing and preparing 
statements. Or if you run a one-person shop with no employees, you won’t see the 
Employees panel.
 NOTE 	 In Figure 2-6, the Invoices and “Enter Bills and Pay Bills” checkboxes are grayed out. That’s because 
QuickBooks turns on some settings automatically based on other settings you chose. For example, if you turn on 
the estimates feature (as in Figure 2-6), the program automatically turns on invoices, because you can convert 
estimates you create into invoices.

Chapter 2: Getting Around in QuickBooks
37
THE HOME 
PAGE
The Home Page also has icons for other important features, like the Chart of Accounts 
icon in the Company panel, which opens the Chart of Accounts window, and the 
Check Register icon in the Banking panel, which opens an account register window 
for the bank account you select.
 TIP 	 The Home Page appears each time you log into a company file. If you prefer to keep the Home Page 
hidden, choose Edit→Preferences→Desktop View, click the My Preferences tab, and then turn off the “Show 
Home page when opening a company file” checkbox. After that, when you want to see the Home Page, simply 
choose Company→Home Page.
Vendors, customers, and employees each have their own panel on the Home Page, 
and the various arrows show how bookkeeping tasks fit together so you can follow 
your money from start to finish. The bookkeeping tasks for each group are laid out 
like breadcrumbs you can follow. However, each company is different, so you don’t 
have to use every icon you see. This section outlines the tasks you can perform from 
each panel and where to find detailed instructions elsewhere in this book.
Vendors
Whether you purchase products and services to run your company or to sell to your 
customers, the Home Page’s Vendors panel steps you through purchasing and pay­
ing for those goods and services; these steps are described in detail in Chapter 9.
The Vendor Center (Figure 2-7) is the best place to create, edit, and view what’s going 
on with your vendors and vendor-related transactions. To open it, click the Vendors 
button at the top of the Home Page’s Vendors panel or choose Vendors→Vendor 
Center. Here’s what you can do there:
• Create a new vendor. In the Vendor Center toolbar at the top of the window, 
click New Vendor→New Vendor and the New Vendor window opens so you 
can create a new vendor record, as described on page 84. If you click New 
Vendor→Add Multiple Vendors instead, QuickBooks lets you create several 
vendors in one window (page 127).
• Find a vendor. If you have a bazillion vendors, you can shorten the vendor list 
that you see in the Vendors tab on the window’s left side. The tab’s unlabeled 
drop-down list is initially set to Active Vendors. If you want to see active and 
inactive vendors alike, click the field and choose All Vendors instead. If you’d 
rather see only the vendors you owe money to, choose “Vendors with Open 
Balances.” Choose Custom Filter to specify exactly the criteria you want.
To do a quick search of vendor records, type part of a vendor’s name in the 
Vendors tab’s second unlabeled box, and then click the Find button, which has 
a magnifying glass on it. (The Find button then changes to an X, which you can 
click to clear the value in the Find box and redisplay the full list.)
• Review a vendor’s record. When you select a vendor on the Vendors tab, basic 
info about that vendor appears at the window’s top right, as shown in Figure 2-7.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
38
THE HOME 
PAGE
FIGURE 2-7
The Vendor Center puts all 
vendor-related tasks in a 
single window. When you 
choose a vendor in the 
list on the left, the Vendor 
Information pane on the 
right displays info about 
that vendor. Click the Open 
Balance link (circled) to 
see the transactions that 
contribute to your balance 
with that vendor. You 
can even click the Map or 
Directions link to find out 
how to get to your vendor. 
And new in QuickBooks 
2015, you can pin a note 
(page 481) you created 
in a vendor’s record so 
it appears at the Vendor 
Information pane’s top 
right, as shown here.
• Edit an existing vendor’s record. To change a vendor’s record, on the Vendors 
tab, right-click the vendor’s name, and then choose Edit Vendor; or, on the right 
side of the Vendor Center, click the Edit button (its icon looks like a pencil tip). 
Either way, the Edit Vendor window opens with the same fields you filled in 
when you created the vendor’s record (page 84).
• Attach an electronic document to a vendor record. Page 314 explains how to 
add attachments to a vendor’s record.
• Create transactions for a vendor. In the Vendor Center toolbar, click New Trans­
actions to display a drop-down menu of vendor-related features like Enter Bills, 
Pay Bills, and Receive Items. (These do the same thing as the icons in the Home 
Page’s Vendors panel.) If you need to review and record several transactions for 
the same vendor, this drop-down menu is a real timesaver. After you select the 
vendor in the Vendors tab and then choose an entry on this drop-down menu, 
the corresponding transaction window opens with that vendor already selected.
• Review and manage transactions, contacts, to-dos, notes, and emails for a 
vendor. When the Vendors tab is displayed, the bottom-right part of the Vendor 
Center displays tabs for transactions, contacts, to-dos, notes, and sent email.

Chapter 2: Getting Around in QuickBooks
39
THE HOME 
PAGE
When you select a vendor in the Vendors tab, the Transactions tab at the bot­
tom right of the Vendor Center lists that vendor’s transactions. By filtering these 
transactions, you can find out which purchase orders are still open, whether 
any bills are overdue, and what payments you’ve made. To see a specific kind 
of transaction, in the Show drop-down list, choose a type, like Bills or Bill Pay­
ments. The Filter By drop-down list lets you restrict the transactions in the table 
by their status, such as Open Bills or Overdue Bills. To track down transactions 
within a specific date range, choose an option from the Date drop-down list. 
(The options in this menu are the same as the ones available in report windows; 
see page 591.)
 TIP 	 To view a transaction in its corresponding window, double-click it in the Transactions tab’s table.
Click the Contacts, To Do’s, Notes, or Sent Email tab to create, edit, or view 
contacts, to-dos, notes, or sent email for the selected vendor.
• Review transactions for all vendors. When you click the Transactions tab 
on the left side of the window (not the bottom right) and then click a type of 
transaction, such as Bills or Bill Payments, you’ll see transactions of that type 
for all vendors on the right side of the window. You can filter these transactions 
by status (such as open or overdue), by date, and, if you use multiple curren­
cies, by currency.
• Print or export vendor information. When you click the Vendors tab on the 
left side of the window, you can easily print, copy, import, or export vendor 
info. In the Vendor Center toolbar, click Print to print vendor lists, vendor info, 
or vendor transactions. Click Excel to paste, import, or export vendor info and 
transactions (page 133). If you click the Transactions tab on the left side of the 
window instead, you can print or export transactions.
• Prepare vendor letters. When the Vendors tab on the left side of the window 
is selected, click Word in the Vendor Center toolbar to create letters to vendors 
(page 672).
Customers
The Home Page’s Customers panel has icons for creating customer-oriented features 
like invoices, statements, sales receipts, and so on. (Chapter 10 describes how to 
work with invoices, estimates, sales orders, refunds, and customer credits. Chapter 
11 covers creating statement charges and statements. And Chapter 13 explains how 
to receive payments and create sales receipts for cash sales.) Click the Customers 
button at the top of the panel (or choose Customers→Customer Center) to open the 
Customer Center (Figure 2-8), where you can perform the following tasks:
• Create a new customer or job. In the Customer Center toolbar at the top of 
the window, click New Customer & Job. In the drop-down menu, choose New 
Customer to create a new customer record (page 70), or choose Add Multiple 
Customer:Jobs to add several customers.

• Add a job to an existing customer. Select the customer in the Customers & 
Jobs tab on the left side of the Customer Center, and then click New Customer 
& Job→Add Job (page 81).
• Find a customer. You can filter the list in the Customers & Jobs tab to show 
active customers, only customers who owe you money (customers with open 
balances), and so on, simply by choosing an option in the tab’s unlabeled drop-
down list (it’s initially set to Active Customers). Choose Custom Filter to specify 
criteria for the customers you want to see. To search for a specific customer, 
type part of the customer’s name in the tab’s second unlabeled box, and then 
click the Find button (it has a magnifying glass on it). The Find button then 
changes to an X, which you can click to clear the value in the Find box and 
redisplay the complete list.
• Review a customer or job record. When you select a customer or job in the 
Customers & Jobs tab, the right side of the center displays the basic 411 about 
that customer or job. In the Customer Information (or Job Information) section, 
shown in Figure 2-8, you can get directions to its location, look at key informa­
tion like the customer’s or job’s open balance, attach electronic documents to 
the record, or run reports about the customer or job.

• Review a customer’s or job’s status. Suppose you want to look at a bar graph 
of sales you’ve made to a customer by time period, review the items that cus­
tomer buys the most, and then scan a customer’s recent invoices and payments. 
First, select the customer in the Customers & Jobs tab. Then, on the right side 
of the Customer Center, click the Customer Snapshot link to open the Company 
Snapshot window (page 43) to the Customer tab.
• Edit a customer or job. To open the Edit Customer or Edit Job window, in the 
Customers & Jobs tab, right-click a customer’s or job’s name, and then choose 
Edit Customer or Edit Job, respectively. Or select a customer or job, and then 
click the Edit button labeled in Figure 2-8.
• Attach an electronic document to a customer’s or job’s record. You can 
add attachments to a customer’s or job’s record or scan images of them into 
QuickBooks, as described on page 314.
• Create transactions for a customer or job. If you’re reviewing a customer’s or 
job’s transactions and realize you forgot to record an invoice or other transac­
tion, you can easily create transactions right from the Customer Center win­
dow. Select the customer or job on the Customers & Jobs tab and then, in the 
window’s toolbar, click New Transactions and choose a transaction type from 
the drop-down menu, such as Estimates, Invoices, or Receive Payments. The 
items in this menu are the same as the icons in the Home Page’s Customers 
panel and open the corresponding window to record that type of transaction.
• Review and manage transactions, contacts, to-dos, notes, and emails for a 
customer or job. When the Customers & Jobs tab is displayed on the left side of 
the window, the bottom right of the Customer Center includes tabs for transac­
tions, contacts, to-dos, notes, and sent emails. If you click the Transactions tab 
at the bottom right of the window, you’ll see a table with the transactions for 
the customer or job you selected in the Customers & Jobs tab. You can filter 
these transactions by type (estimates or invoices, for example), status, and 
date. Double-click a transaction in the list to open a window with details about 
it. Click the Contacts, To Do’s, Notes, or Sent Email tabs to create, edit, or view 
contacts, to-dos, notes, or emails for the selected customer.
• Review transactions for all customers. When you click the Transactions tab 
on the left side of the window and then click a type of transaction (such as Es­
timate, Invoices, or Received Payments), the right side of the window displays 
transactions of that type for all customers. Depending on the type you choose, 
you can filter these transactions by status (such as open or overdue), payment 
method, date, and—if you use multiple currencies—currency.
• Print or export customer information. When you click the Customers & Jobs tab 
on the left side of the window, you can print, copy, import, or export customer 
info. In the center’s toolbar, click Print to print customer information (page 158) 
or click Excel to import or export customer and job info (page 133). If you click 
the Transactions tab on the left side of the window instead, you can print or 
export customer transactions.

Employees
The Home Page’s Employees panel has only a few icons. The devilish details arise 
when you click one of these icons to enter time, set up paychecks, or pay payroll tax 
liabilities. The Employee Center works the same way as the Vendor and Customer 
centers you just learned about. To open it, click the Employees button at the top of 
the panel on the Home Page or choose Employees→Employee Center.
In the Employee Center, you can create new records for employees, update info for 
existing employees, and view transactions like paychecks. On the Employees tab on 
the left side of the center, you can filter the list to view active employees, released 
employees (ones who no longer work for you), or all employees. See Chapter 8 to 
learn how to record the time that employees work. And online Appendix D (avail­
able at www.missingmanuals.com/cds) covers the process of paying employees 
and other payroll expenses.
Company Features
The Company panel is on the right side of the Home Page. The two icons in this panel 
that you’ll probably click most often are Chart of Accounts and Items & Services, 
which open the Chart of Accounts (page 56) and Item List (page 106) windows, 
respectively. Click Calendar to review transactions and to-dos in the Calendar win­
dow (page 486).
If you track inventory, click the Inventory Activities icon and then choose a feature, 
such as Adjust Quantity/Value On Hand, which lets you change the quantity and 
value of your inventory (page 542). If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, 
click Inventory Center to open a window similar to the Customer Center except that 
it focuses on the status of—and transactions involving—your inventory items (page 
538). If you’re interested in other apps and services that Intuit has to offer, click the 
“Web and Mobile Apps” icon, and a browser window opens to Intuit’s App Center.
Banking
The Home Page’s Banking panel is a one-stop shop for banking tasks. Whether you 
visit this panel frequently or rarely depends on how you like to record transactions. 
For example, you can click the Write Checks icon to open the Write Checks window 
(page 202) or simply press Ctrl+W to do the same thing. (Or, if you like to record 
checks in a check register window, you might prefer to click the Check Register icon 
instead.) Similarly, clicking the Enter Credit Card Charges icon opens the Enter Credit 
Card Charges window (page 213), though you can also record credit card charges 
directly in a credit card account’s register (page 374).
Clicking the Record Deposits icon opens the “Payments to Deposit” window so 
you can record bank deposits (page 368). The Reconcile icon opens the Begin 
Reconciliation dialog box so you can reconcile your QuickBooks records to your 
bank statement (page 389). And the Print Checks icon opens the “Select Checks to

 NOTE 	 If you use the left icon bar (View→Left Icon Bar), you can see account balances by clicking View 
Balances in the icon bar’s middle section. (See page 30 for more about the icon bar.)
If you use the top icon bar (View→Top Icon Bar), the top-right part of the Home Page shows account balances. 
Below those is a “Do More with QuickBooks” section that includes a few links to additional services that Intuit 
offers. You also see a Backup Status section that tells you when your last backup ran and includes info about 
the Intuit Data Protect backup service (page 497). If any of these sections are collapsed, click the section’s down 
arrow to expand it. Click a section’s up arrow to collapse it.
The Company Snapshot
The Company Snapshot window (Figure 2-9) is a dashboard that shows important 
aspects of your company’s financial state, like account balances, income breakdown 
(by top-level income accounts), customers who owe you money, best-selling items, 
and reminders. To open this window, choose Company→Company Snapshot or click 
the Snapshots icon in either icon bar. You can choose from 12 different views (page 
705) to see the information you care most about.

financial status (Figure 2-10). You can change date ranges and click various parts 
of the dashboard to get a closer look:
• Graphs. Initially, the tab’s top panel displays a Profit & Loss graph in which 
monthly income is represented by green bars above the horizontal axis and 
monthly expenses appear in blue below the axis. The black line hopping from 
month to month is your monthly profit. To change the graph’s date range, 
choose the range you want from the drop-down list at the graph’s top left. To

CHAPTER

I
f you’ve just started running a business and keeping your company’s books, all 
this talk of accounts, credits, and debits might have you flummoxed. Accounting 
is a cross between mathematics and the mystical arts; its goal is to record and 
report the financial performance of an organization. The end result of bookkeeping 
and accounting is a set of financial statements (page 443), but the starting point 
is the chart of accounts.
In accounting, an account is more than a real-world account you have at a financial 
institution; it’s like a bucket for holding money used for a specific purpose. When 
you earn money, you document those earnings in an income account, just as you 
might toss the change from a day’s take at the lemonade stand into the jar on your 
desk. When you buy supplies for your business, that expense shows up in an ex­
pense account that works a lot like the shoebox you throw receipts into. If you buy 
a building, its value ends up in an asset account. And if you borrow money to buy 
that building, the mortgage owed shows up in a liability account.
Accounts come in a variety of types to reflect whether you’ve earned or spent 
money, whether you own something or owe money to someone else, as well as a 
few other financial situations. Your chart of accounts is a list of all the accounts you 
use to track money in your business.
Neophytes and experienced business folks alike will be relieved to know that you 
don’t have to build a chart of accounts from scratch in QuickBooks. This chapter 
explains how to get a ready-made chart of accounts for your business and what to 
do with it once you’ve got it. If you want to add or modify accounts in your chart of 
accounts, you’ll learn how to do that, too.

ACQUIRING 
A CHART OF 
ACCOUNTS
 NOTE 	 Industry-specific Premier editions of QuickBooks include a chart of accounts, an Item List, Payroll 
items, and preferences already tuned to your industry (such as construction, manufacturing, nonprofit, professional 
services, or retail). The industry-specific editions also have features unique to each industry, like the Contractor 
edition’s enhanced job costing. These features may save you time during setup and in your day-to-day book­
keeping, but you have to decide whether you want to spend a few hundred dollars more than the QuickBooks 
Pro price tag to get them.
Acquiring a Chart of Accounts
When you create a new QuickBooks company file and choose an industry (page 
11), the program automatically sets up the chart of accounts with accounts that are 
typical for that industry. For example, if you choose a product-oriented industry, 
you’ll see an income account for product or parts income, while a service-oriented 
business gets an income account for service or labor income. If your company is 
like many small businesses, the chart of accounts that QuickBooks creates includes 
everything you need.
However, if you want to customize your chart of accounts to mirror your company’s 
needs, the easiest—although probably not the cheapest—way to get a chart of ac­
counts is from your accountant. Accountants understand the accounting guidelines 
set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB—pronounced “faz bee”), a 
private-sector organization that sets standards with the SEC’s blessing. When your 
accountant builds a QuickBooks chart of accounts for you, you can be reasonably 
sure that it includes all the accounts you need to track your business and that those 
accounts conform to accounting standards. If you’re a business owner and want a 
specific account or want to see your business financials in a particular way, ask your 
accountant what type of accounts to use and how to set them up.
 NOTE 	 Don’t worry—getting an accountant to build a chart of accounts for you probably won’t bust your 
budget, since the accountant won’t start from scratch. Many financial professionals maintain spreadsheets of 
accounts and build a chart of accounts by importing a customized account list into QuickBooks. Or they may keep 
QuickBooks company files around to use as templates for new ones.
If you don’t want to pay an accountant to create a chart of accounts for you, how 
about finding one built by experts and available at no charge? A quick search on 
the Web for “QuickBooks chart of accounts” returns links to sites with predefined 
charts of accounts. For example, in the not-for-profit world, the National Center for 
Charitable Statistics website includes downloadable QuickBooks files that contain 
the Unified Chart of Accounts for nonprofits (known as the UCOA); see http://nccs.
urban.org/projects/ucoa.cfm. You can download a QuickBooks backup file of a 
nonprofit company file, complete with a chart of accounts (see page 501 to learn 
how to restore a backup file), an .iif file that you can import into QuickBooks, or a 
backup file for the Mac version of QuickBooks.

 NOTE 	 If you have an Excel spreadsheet with your company account information, you can import that info 
directly into your company file. Page 133 has the full story on importing from Excel.
If you run a restaurant, you can go to www.rrgconsulting.com/restaurant_coa.htm 
and download a free .iif file with a restaurant-oriented chart of accounts that you 
can import into QuickBooks, as explained in the next section.
Importing a Chart of Accounts
If you download an .iif file with a chart of accounts, you can import that file into a 
QuickBooks company file. Because you’re importing a chart of accounts, you want to 
create your company file with basic info about your company and as few accounts as 
possible in the chart of accounts list. Here’s how you create a QuickBooks company 
file with bare-bones information and then import a chart of accounts from an .iif file:
1.	 Choose File→New Company and then, in the QuickBooks Setup dialog box 
that appears, click Express Start.
If you see a screen that asks for your email address and password, enter the 
email address and password for your Intuit account, and then click Continue.
2.	 On the “Tell us about your business” screen, enter your company’s name, 
type, and tax ID. In the Industry box, enter Other/None, and then click 
Continue.
3.	 On the “Enter your business contact information” screen, do just that.
See Chapter 1 for details. If you click Preview Your Settings and then click the 
Chart of Accounts tab, you see that the accounts list is empty, which is what 
you want. Click OK to close the preview window.
4.	 After you finish filling in your contact info, click Create Company File.
QuickBooks creates your company file and then displays the “You’ve got a 
company file! Now add your info” screen in the QuickBooks Setup dialog box.
5.	 To close the QuickBooks Setup dialog box, click Start Working, and then 
click the X at the top right of the Quick Start Center window that appears.
You can also close the QuickBooks Setup dialog box by clicking the X at the 
window’s upper right.
6.	 Choose File→Utilities→Import→IIF Files.
QuickBooks opens the Import dialog box to the folder where you stored your 
company file and sets the “Files of type” box to “IIF Files (*.IIF).”
7.	 Navigate to the folder that contains the .iif file you want to import, select 
the file, and then click Open.
A message box appears that shows how the import is progressing. If all goes 
well, QuickBooks then displays a message box that tells you that it imported 
the data successfully; click OK.

PLANNING 
THE CHART OF 
ACCOUNTS
If QuickBooks runs into problems with the data in the .iif file, it tells you that it 
didn’t import the data successfully. In that case, you have to open the .iif file in a 
text editor or Excel and correct the account info. (You can see what information 
QuickBooks expects by exporting an account list, as described on page 685.)
To admire your new chart of accounts, in the QuickBooks Home Page’s Company 
panel, click Chart of Accounts (or press Ctrl+A). Now that your chart of accounts 
is in place, you can add more accounts, hide accounts you don’t need, merge ac­
counts, or edit the accounts on the list. The rest of this chapter explains how to do 
all these things.
Planning the Chart of Accounts
A chart of accounts is a tool for tracking your company’s finances at a relatively 
high level—it helps you produce financial statements and prepare your business tax 
returns. When setting up your chart of accounts, bear in mind that it will be easier to 
work with if you keep the number of accounts to a minimum. (The published income 
statements of even ginormous global corporations typically fit on a single page.) 
This section helps you figure out which accounts you need and provides guidelines 
for naming and numbering them.
Do You Need Another Account?
QuickBooks offers several features—including items, jobs, and classes—that can 
provide details about your company’s performance without you having to add ad­
ditional accounts. So before you create an account, think about whether another 
feature can track the information you want instead. Here’s a brief description of 
what each feature does and when to use it:
• Accounts. When you create transactions in QuickBooks, the program allocates 
money to accounts in your chart of accounts. Then, when you run a Profit & 
Loss report (page 448), you see financial results by account. So create a new 
account if you want to see a particular pool of money broken out in your finan­
cial reports. For example, add an income account for services you’re offering 
in addition to your product sales.
 NOTE 	 Subaccounts (page 58) are an option if you want to break one category into several smaller pieces, 
such as divvying up travel expenses into airfare, lodging, transportation, and meals.
• Items. In QuickBooks, items track details about what you buy and sell. For ex­
ample, you might create dozens of items for each specific service you provide, 
such as cutting down trees, cutting logs, chipping wood, splitting wood, and 
hauling trash. However, each of those items can be assigned to the same services 
income account. Chapter 5 provides the full story on items.

Chapter 3: Setting Up a Chart of Accounts
51
PLANNING 
THE CHART OF 
ACCOUNTS
• Jobs. If you work on different projects for the same customer, you can create 
separate jobs for each project (page 81). That way, you can assign invoices to 
specific jobs and track income by job. You can also track job expenses by mak­
ing items, time, or other expenses billable to specific jobs.
• Classes. If your business is broken into segments—such as regions, business 
units, or partners in a partnership—you can turn to classes (page 140). You 
can assign a class to each transaction, such as an invoice or bill, which lets you 
track income and expenses across accounts, customers, vendors, and more. 
For example, if you create a class for each business unit in your company, you 
can assign the appropriate class to each transaction you record. Then a Profit 
& Loss by Class report (page 451) will produce an income statement for each 
business unit.
Naming and Numbering Accounts
Account names and numbers make it easy for accountants, bookkeepers, and 
company employees to find the accounts they need. In addition, with standardized 
naming and numbering, you can compare your company’s financial performance 
with others in your industry. This section suggests some rules to follow as you set 
up naming and numbering conventions.
If you accept the accounts that QuickBooks recommends when you set up your 
company file, then they already have assigned names and numbers, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. You might think this lets you off the hook. But by taking the time to learn 
standard account numbers and names, you’ll find working with accounts more logical 
and understand more of what your accountant and bookkeeper say.
ORGANIZING ACCOUNT NUMBERS
Account numbers are initially turned off when you create a new company file in 
QuickBooks (page 54 explains how to display them), and you don’t have to use 
them. However, account numbers make it easier for your bookkeeper or accountant 
to work with your financial records. This section explains the typical numbering 
convention that financial folks use.
Companies reserve ranges of numbers for different types of accounts, so they can 
identify the type of account by its number alone. Business models vary, so you’ll 
find account numbers carved up in different ways depending on the industry. Think 
about your personal finances: You spend money on lots of different things, but 
your income derives from a precious few sources. Businesses and nonprofits are 
no different. So you might find income accounts numbered from 4000 to 4999 and 
expense accounts using numbers anywhere from 5000 through 9999 (see Table 3-1).

PLANNING 
THE CHART OF 
ACCOUNTS
 NOTE 	 Most businesses use the same account-numbering scheme up until the number 4999. After that, things 
can differ because some companies require more income accounts, but in most businesses, expense accounts are 
the most numerous.
Account numbering conventions don’t just carve number ranges up for account 
types. If you read annual reports as a hobby, you know that companies further 
compartmentalize their finances. For example, assets and liabilities get split into 
current and long-term categories. (Current means something that’s expected to 
happen within the next 12 months, such as a loan that’s due in 3 months; long-term 
is anything beyond 12 months.) Typically, companies show assets and liabilities pro­
gressing from the shortest to the longest term, and the asset and liability account 
numbers follow suit. Here’s one way to allocate account numbers for current and 
progressively longer-term assets:
• 1000–1099. Immediately available cash, such as a checking account, savings 
account, or petty cash.
• 1100–1499. Assets you can convert into cash within a few months to a year, 
including Accounts Receivable, inventory assets, and other current assets.
• 1500–1799. Long-term assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, and other 
fixed assets.
• 1800–1999. Other assets.
Companies also break expenses down into smaller categories. For example, many 
companies keep an eye on whether their sales team is doing its job by tracking sales 
expenses separately and monitoring the ratio of sales to sales expenses. Sales ex­
penses often appear in the 5000–5999 range. QuickBooks reinforces this standard 
by automatically creating a Cost of Goods Sold account numbered 5001. (You can 
create as many Cost of Goods Sold accounts as you need to track expenses that 
relate directly to your income, such as the cost of purchasing products you sell, as 
well as what you pay your salespeople.) Other companies assign overhead expenses 
to accounts in the 7000–7999 range, so they can assign a portion of those expenses 
to each job performed.
 TIP 	 When you add new accounts to your chart of accounts, increment the account number by 5 or 10 to leave 
room in the numbering scheme for similar accounts you might need in the future. For example, if your checking 
account number is 1000, assign 1010 or 1020 to your new savings account rather than 1001.
In QuickBooks, an account number can be up to seven digits long, but the program 
sorts numbers beginning with the leftmost digit. So if you want to categorize in ex­
cruciating detail, slice your number ranges into sets of 10,000. For example, assets 
range from 10000 to 19999; income accounts span 40000 to 49999, and so on.
 NOTE 	 Because QuickBooks sorts accounts by number, beginning with the leftmost digit, account 4100020 
appears before account 4101.

To hide them, turn off this checkbox.
3.	 Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
With this setting turned on, account numbers appear in the Chart of Accounts win­
dow, account drop-down lists, and account fields. In addition, the Add New Account 
and Edit Account windows display the Number box so you can add or modify an 
account’s number.
 NOTE 	 Turning off the “Use account numbers” checkbox doesn’t remove account numbers you’ve already 
added; it simply hides them in the spots mentioned above. You can see them again by turning the checkbox back 
on. However, you can’t add account numbers to any accounts you create while the checkbox is turned off. If you 
create an account anyway, you can then edit it (page 63) to add an account number after you turn on the “Use 
account numbers” checkbox.
CHOOSING GOOD ACCOUNT NAMES
Account names should be meaningful, both to you and your accountant (or book­
keeper). In addition, your accounts should be unique in name and function because 
you don’t need two accounts for the same type of income, expense, or financial 
bucket. For example, if you consider advertising and marketing two distinctly differ­
ent activities, then create an account for each. But if advertising and marketing blur 
in your mind, then create one account with a name like “Marketing & Advertising.”
 NOTE 	 Because accounts represent high-level categories, stick to names that summarize the income or 
expense, such as Service Income and Product Income. Accounts and names like Tom’s Consulting, Dick’s Consulting, 
and Harry’s Consulting are too specific—and might cause confusion if Rosie takes over Harry’s work.
QuickBooks does its part to enforce unique account names. Say you try to create a 
new expense account named Postage, but an account by that name already exists. 
QuickBooks displays the message “This name is already in use. Please use another 
name.” What QuickBooks can’t do is ensure that each account represents a unique 
category of money. Without a naming standard, you could end up with multiple 
accounts with unique names, each representing the same category, as shown by 
the following names for accounts used to track postage:

Shipping
If you haven’t used QuickBooks before, here are some rules you can apply to help 
make your account names consistent:
• Word order. If you include the account type in the name, then append it to 
the end of the name. You’ll spot “Postage Expense” more easily than “Expense 
Postage.”
• Consistent punctuation. Choose “and” or “&” for accounts that cover more 
than one item, like “Dues and Subscriptions.” And decide whether to include 
apostrophes, as in “Owners Draw” or “Owner’s Draw.”
• Spaces. Decide whether to include spaces for readability or to eliminate them 
for brevity; for example, “Dues & Subscriptions” vs. “Dues&Subscriptions.”
• Abbreviation. If you abbreviate words in account names, then choose a standard 
abbreviation length. If you go with four-letter abbreviations, for example, “Post­
age” would become “Post.” For a three-letter abbreviation, you might use “Pst.”
 WARNING 	 QuickBooks won’t enforce your naming standards. So after you set the rules for account names, 
write them down so you don’t forget them. A consistent written standard encourages everyone (yourself included) 
to trust and follow the naming rules. Also, urge everyone to display inactive accounts (page 63) and scan the 
chart of accounts for synonyms to see if such an account already exists before creating a new one. These rules 
are easier to enforce if you limit the number of people who can create and edit accounts (page 725).
Creating Accounts and Subaccounts
As the box on page 57 explains, different types of accounts represent dramatically 
different financial animals. The good news is that every type of account in Quick­
Books shares most of the same fields, so you need to learn only one account-creation 
procedure.
If you look closely at the chart of accounts list in Figure 3-1, you’ll notice that ac­
counts fall into two main categories: those with balances and those without. If you’re 
really on your toes, you might also notice that accounts with balances are the ones 
that appear on the Balance Sheet report. (Accounts without balances appear on 
the Profit & Loss report.) To learn more about financial statements and the accounts 
they reference, see Chapter 23.

Creating an Account
After you’ve had your business for a while, you won’t add new accounts very often. 
However, you might need one if you start up a new line of income, take on a mortgage 
for your new office building, or want a new expense account for the subcontractors 
you hire to manage your workload.
Creating accounts in QuickBooks is simple. Before you can create an account, you 
have to open the Chart of Accounts window. Here are a few ways to do that:
• Press Ctrl+A (which you can do from anywhere in the program).
• At the top right of the Home Page, in the Company panel, click Chart of Accounts.
• In the menu bar, choose Lists→Chart of Accounts.
The Chart of Accounts window works much like other list windows. For example, you 
can sort the account list by different columns or drag accounts in the list to different 
locations. (See page 158 to learn how to sort and rearrange lists.)
 TIP 	 You can create accounts on the fly by choosing <Add New> in any Account drop-down list. Suppose you 
create a new Service item (in the Item List window, press Ctrl+N) and want a new income account to track revenue 
for that service. In the New Item dialog box, scroll to the top of the Account drop-down list and then choose <Add 
New>. In the Add New Account window that appears, fill in the various fields, and then click Save & Close. Back in 
the New Item dialog box, QuickBooks displays the new account in the Account field, and you can finish creating 
your item.
Once you’ve opened the Chart of Accounts window, here’s how to create an account:
1.	 Press Ctrl+N to open the Add New Account window.
Alternatively, on the menu bar at the bottom of the Chart of Accounts window, 
click Account→New. Or right-click anywhere in the Chart of Accounts window, 
and then choose New from the shortcut menu. No matter which method you 
use, QuickBooks opens the Add New Account window shown in Figure 3-2.
2.	 Select the type of account you want to create, such as Bank for a bank ac­
count, and then click Continue.
The Add New Account window lists the most common kinds of accounts. If 
you don’t see the type you want—Cost of Goods Sold, for example—select 
the Other Account Types option, and then choose from the drop-down menu 
visible in Figure 3-2.

Making Sense of Account Types
QuickBooks’ account types are standard ones used in finance. 
Here’s a quick introduction to the different types and what 
they represent:
• Bank. Accounts that you hold at a financial institution, 
such as a checking, savings, money market, or petty 
cash account.
• Accounts Receivable. The money that your customers 
owe you, like outstanding invoices and goods purchased 
on credit.
• Other Current Asset. Things you own that you’ll use 
or convert to cash within 12 months, such as prepaid 
expenses.
• Fixed Asset. Things your company owns that decrease in 
value over time (depreciate), like equipment that wears 
out or becomes obsolete.
• Other Asset. If you won’t convert an asset to cash in the 
next 12 months and it isn’t a depreciable asset, then 
it’s—you guessed it—an other asset. A long-term note 
receivable is one example.
• Accounts Payable. This is a special type of current liability 
account (money you owe in the next 12 months) that 
represents what you owe to vendors.
• Credit Card. Just what it sounds like: a credit card account.
• Other Current Liability. Money you owe in the next 12 
months, such as sales tax and short-term loans.
• Long Term Liability. Money you owe after the next 12 months, 
like mortgage payments you’ll pay over several years. 
• Equity. The owners’ equity in your company, including 
the original capital invested in the company and retained 
earnings. (Money that owners withdraw from the 
company also shows up in an equity account but reduces 
the value of the account.)
• Income. The revenue you generate through your main 
business functions, like sales or consulting services.
• Cost of Goods Sold. The cost of products and materials 
that you originally held in inventory but then sold. You 
can also use this type of account to track other expenses 
related to sales, such as commissions and what you pay 
subcontractors to do work for your customers.
• Expense. The money you spend to run your company.
• Other Income. Money you receive from sources other than 
business operations, such as interest income.
• Other Expense. Money you pay out for things other than 
business operations, like interest.
• Non-posting Account. QuickBooks creates non-posting 
accounts automatically when you use features such as 
estimates and purchase orders. For example, when you 
create an estimate (page 278), you don’t want that money 
to appear on your financial reports, so QuickBooks stores 
those values in non-posting accounts.
3.	 In the Number box in the upper right of the Add New Account window (Figure 
3-3), type the account number you want to use in the chart of accounts. (If 
you don’t see the Number box, flip to page 54 to learn how to display it.)
If you keep the Chart of Accounts window in view while creating accounts, 
you can review the account numbers for similar types of accounts. That way, 
you can give the new account a number that’s 5 or 10 higher than an existing 
account number, so that the new one snuggles in with its compatriots in the 
chart of accounts.

appears on the right side

4.	 In the Account Name box, type a name for the account.
See page 54 for tips on standardizing account names.
 NOTE 	 If you create an account and don’t see one of the fields mentioned here, it simply doesn’t apply to 
that account type.
5.	 If you want the account to be a subaccount, then turn on the “Subaccount 
of” checkbox. Then, in the drop-down list, choose the account that you 
want to act as the parent.
As the box on page 60 explains, subaccounts are a good way to track your 
finances in more detail. In the chart of accounts, subaccounts are indented 
below their parent accounts to make the hierarchy easy to see, as shown at 
the bottom of Figure 3-1.

The Bank account type 
includes every account 
field except Note, as well 
as a few fields that you 
won’t find in any other 
account type, such as Bank 
Acct. No. and Routing 
Number. If you want 
QuickBooks to remind 
you to order checks, in 
the “Remind me to order 
checks when I reach check 
number” field, type the 
check number you want 
to use as a trigger. And if 
you want the program to 
open a browser window 
to an Intuit site where you 
can order supplies, turn 
on “Order checks I can 
print from QuickBooks.” 
If you get checks from 
somewhere else, just 
reorder checks the way 
you normally do.
 TIP 	 When you use subaccounts, QuickBooks displays both the parent account’s name and the subaccount’s 
name in the Account fields throughout the program, which often makes it impossible to tell which account a 
transaction uses, as you can see in Figure 3-4 (top). If you want to see only the lowest-level subaccount in Account 
fields, head to the Accounting section of the Preferences dialog box, click the Company Preferences tab, and then 
turn on the “Show lowest subaccount only” checkbox (see page 636).
6.	 If you’ve turned on QuickBooks’ multiple currency preference, the Currency 
box appears below the “Subaccount of” checkbox. If the currency for the 
account is different from the one listed there, choose the correct currency 
in the drop-down list.
If you do business in more than one currency, see page 656 to learn how to set 
up multiple currencies in QuickBooks.

UP TO SPEED
Adding Detail with Subaccounts
Say your company’s travel expenses are sky-high and you want 
to start tracking what you spend on different types of travel, 
such as airfare, lodging, and limousine services. Subaccounts 
make it easy to track details like these. Subaccounts are noth-
ing more than partitions within higher-level accounts (called 
parent accounts).
When you post transactions to subaccounts only (not their 
parent account), your reports show the subtotals for the sub-
accounts and a grand total for the parent account, such as the 
Travel account (number 6336, say) and its subaccounts Airfare 
(6338), Lodging (6340), and Transportation (6342), for example.
Subaccounts also come in handy for assigning similar expenses 
to different lines on tax forms. For example, the IRS doesn’t 
treat all travel expenses the same: You can deduct only half 
of your meal and entertainment expenses, while other travel 
expenses are fully deductible. For this reason, you might create 
“Meals and Entertainment” as a separate subaccount within 
the Travel account.
7.	 To add a description of the account, fill in the Description box.
For instance, you can define whether a bank account is linked to another account 
or give examples of the types of expenses that apply to a particular expense

account. The Description field can hold up to 200 characters, which should be 
more than enough.
8.	 If you see a field for an account number—such as Bank Acct. No., Credit Card 
Acct. No., or simply Account No.—type in the number for your real-world 
account at your financial institution (checking account, savings account, 
loan, and so on).
If the account type you chose in step 2 doesn’t include a field for an account 
number, you see the Note field instead, which you can use to store any additional 
information you want to document about the account.
9.	 For a bank account, in the Routing Number box, type your bank’s routing 
number.
This is the nine-digit number in funny-looking font at the bottom of your checks.
10.	 To associate the account with a tax form and a specific line on that form, in 
the Tax-Line Mapping drop-down list, choose the entry for the appropriate 
tax form and tax line.
If you haven’t specified the tax form that your company files with the IRS, the 
Tax-Line Mapping field is set to <Unassigned>. See page 11 to learn how to 
choose a tax form for your company.
If QuickBooks hasn’t assigned a tax line for you, you can scan the entries in the 
drop-down list for a likely match. If you don’t find an entry that seems right or 
if QuickBooks tells you the one you chose isn’t compatible with the account 
type, your best bet is to call your accountant or the IRS. You can also get a hint 
of an appropriate tax line for the account you’re creating by examining one of 
QuickBooks’ sample files (page 9).
To remove a tax line from an account, in the drop-down list, choose <Unas­
signed>.
 NOTE 	 Below the Tax-Line Mapping field, you may see the Enter Opening Balance button. It’s easy to figure 
out the opening balance for a brand-new account—it’s zero—so you can ignore this button. If you’re setting up 
QuickBooks with accounts that existed prior to your QuickBooks start date, those accounts do have opening bal­
ances. Even so, clicking the Enter Opening Balance button isn’t the best way to specify an opening balance for an 
account you’re adding to your company file. The box on page 62 explains how to specify opening balances for all 
your accounts in just a few steps.
11.	 Click the Save & New button to save the current account and create another 
one.
To save the account you just created and close the Add New Account window, 
click Save & Close instead. Click Cancel to discard the account-in-progress and

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Doing Opening Balances Right
When I add an account to my company file, can I just click the 
Enter Opening Balance button and type the balance I want to 
start with in the Opening Balance field? That seems the most 
logical place for it.
You can, but your accountant may not be too happy about it. 
Filling in the Opening Balance field from the Add New Account 
window (or in the Edit Account window, for that matter) auto-
matically adds that balance to the Opening Bal Equity account, 
which accountants consider sloppy bookkeeping. Instead, they 
usually recommend creating a journal entry from your trial 
balance for most of your accounts. (To see what an opening 
balance journal entry looks like, head to page 429.)
The three exceptions are your Accounts Receivable (AR), Ac-
counts Payable (AP), and bank accounts. Because QuickBooks 
requires customer names and vendor names in journal entries 
that contain AR and AP accounts, you’re better off creating 
invoices and bills to define your AR and AP opening balances. 
With bank accounts, you can enter your previous reconciled bal-
ance in the journal entry and then bring the account up to date 
by recording all the transactions since your last reconciliation. 
If you work with an accountant, ask her how she’d like you to 
enter opening balances—or better yet, have her do it for you.
Whoa! What’s a journal entry? What’s a trial balance?
Here’s the deal: Journal entries (page 426) are mechanisms 
for moving money between accounts—on paper, that is. A 
trial balance (page 442) is a report (from your accountant or 
your old accounting system) that lists all your accounts with 
their balances in either the Debit or Credit column. In the days 
of paper-based ledgers, bean counters totaled the Debit and 
Credit columns. If the totals weren’t equal, the accountant 
had to track down the arithmetic error. Happily, QuickBooks’ 
digital brain does the math for you, without errors. But it’s up 
to you to set up the opening-balance journal entry properly 
in the first place.
If you look at the trial balance on the first day of your fiscal 
year, it’s quite simple—it includes balances only for your bal-
ance sheet accounts, not income and expense accounts. You 
can use these values to fill in a journal entry to assign all your 
accounts’ opening balances: First, set the journal entry’s date 
to the last day of the previous fiscal year; that way, you can 
start fresh for your current fiscal year. Next, for each account 
except your AR and AP accounts, add a line in the journal entry 
with the account name and the balance from your trial-balance 
report in either the Debit or Credit column. Finally, create 
invoices and bills to define the opening balances for your AR 
and AP accounts.
Working with Accounts
From time to time, you might need to modify your accounts to, for example, change 
an account’s name or description. If you no longer need an account, you can hide 
it to keep your chart of accounts list tidy. On the other hand, if you created an ac­
count by mistake, you can delete it. And merging accounts comes in handy if you 
find several accounts that represent the same thing. This section describes how to 
make all these changes to accounts.

Chapter 3: Setting Up a Chart of Accounts
63
WORKING WITH 
ACCOUNTS
Modifying Accounts
If you stick to your account numbering and naming conventions, you’ll have few 
reasons to edit accounts. But just in case, the Edit Account window lets you tweak an 
account’s name and description, adjust its number to make room for new accounts, 
and change its level in the chart of accounts hierarchy.
You’re not likely to change an account’s type unless you chose the wrong one when 
you created the account. If you do need to change the account type, back up your 
QuickBooks file first (see page 495) in case the change has effects that you didn’t 
anticipate. Also, note that QuickBooks has several restrictions on changing account 
types. You can’t change an account’s type if:
• It has subaccounts.
• It’s an Accounts Receivable or Accounts Payable account. (You also can’t change 
other types of accounts to AR or AP accounts.)
• QuickBooks automatically created the account, like Undeposited Funds.
To modify an account, in the Chart of Accounts window, select the account you want 
to edit, and then press Ctrl+E or click Account→Edit Account. In the Edit Account 
window that appears, make your changes, and then click Save & Close.
Hiding Accounts
If you create an account by mistake, you can delete it (you’ll learn how in a sec). 
However, because QuickBooks drops your financial transactions into account buckets 
and you don’t want to throw away historical information, you’ll usually want to hide 
accounts that you don’t use anymore instead of deleting them.
Records of past transactions are important, whether you want to review the amount 
of business you’ve received from a customer or the IRS is asking unsettling ques­
tions. When you hide an account in QuickBooks, the account continues to hold your 
historical transactions, but it doesn’t appear in account lists, so you can’t choose it 
by mistake with a misplaced click. For example, you wouldn’t delete your Nutrition 
Service income account just because you’ve discontinued your nutrition-consulting 
service to focus on selling your new book, The See Food Diet. The income you earned 
from that service in the past needs to stay in your records.
Hiding and reactivating accounts (Figure 3-5) can also come in handy if QuickBooks 
created a chart of accounts for you based on the industry you chose during setup 
(page 11). If the chart of accounts it created includes accounts you don’t think you 
need, simply hide those accounts for the time being. That way, if you find yourself 
saying, “Gosh, I wish I had an account for the accumulated depreciation of vehicles,” 
the solution might be as simple as reactivating a hidden account.

Bottom: To reactivate 
a hidden account, first 
display all your accounts 
by turning on the “Include

bottom of the Chart of 
Accounts window. When 
you do that, QuickBooks 
adds a column with an X 
as its heading and displays 
an X in that column for 
every hidden account in 
the list. To un-hide an 
account, click the X next to 
its name.
If the account has 
subaccounts, QuickBooks 
displays the Activate Group 
dialog box; there, click Yes 
to reactivate the account 
and all its subaccounts.
Deleting Accounts
You can delete an account only if nothing in QuickBooks references it in any way. An 
account with references is a red flag that deleting it might not be the right choice. If 
you try to delete such an account, QuickBooks displays a message box telling you 
it can’t delete the account and recommends making it inactive instead. If that isn’t 
enough to deter you, the sheer tedium of removing references to an account should 
nudge you toward hiding the account instead. If you insist on deleting an account, 
here are the conditions that prevent you from doing so and what you have to do to 
remove these constraints:

Chapter 3: Setting Up a Chart of Accounts
65
WORKING WITH 
ACCOUNTS
• An item uses the account. If you create any items that use the account as an 
income account, expense account, cost of goods sold account, or inventory asset 
account, you can’t delete it. You have to edit the items to use other accounts 
first, as described on page 118.
• The account has subaccounts. You have to delete all subaccounts before you 
can delete the parent account.
• Payroll uses the account. You can’t delete an account if your payroll setup 
uses it.
• A transaction references the account. If you created even one transaction that 
uses the account, either edit that transaction to use a different account or hide 
the account if you want to keep the transaction the way it is.
• The account has a balance. An account balance comes from either an opening 
balance transaction or other transactions that reference the account. You re­
move an account balance by reassigning all the transactions to another account.
To delete or reassign transactions, in the Chart of Accounts window, double-click the 
account’s name. For accounts with balances, QuickBooks opens a register window 
where you can select a transaction and then edit it or press Ctrl+D to delete it. For 
accounts without balances, QuickBooks opens an Account QuickReport window. To 
edit or delete a transaction that appears in this report, double-click the transaction. 
QuickBooks then opens a window related to that transaction (for instance, the Write 
Checks window appears if the transaction is a check). Edit the transaction to use a 
different account, or right-click anywhere in that window and choose Delete Check 
or the corresponding delete command for the type of transaction.
After you’ve deleted all references to the account, in the Chart of Accounts win­
dow, select the account you want to delete, and then press Ctrl+D or choose 
Account→Delete Account. QuickBooks asks you to confirm that you want to delete 
the account; click OK.
Merging Accounts
Suppose you find multiple accounts with the same purpose—Postage and Mail 
Expense, say—lurking in your chart of accounts. No problem! You can merge the 
accounts into one and then remind everyone who creates accounts in QuickBooks 
about your naming conventions. (If you haven’t gotten around to setting up naming 
conventions, see page 54 for some guidelines.)
 TIP 	 Before you merge accounts, see what your accountant thinks. There’s no going back once you’ve merged 
two accounts—they’re combined for good. And QuickBooks’ audit trail (page 437) doesn’t keep track of this kind 
of change.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
66
WORKING WITH 
ACCOUNTS
QuickBooks sweeps all the transactions from the account you merge into the ac­
count you keep, so you can merge accounts only if they’re the same type. (As an 
experienced manager, you can imagine the havoc that merging income and expense 
accounts would cause in your financial statements.) In addition, accounts must be 
at the same level in the chart of accounts; in other words, they both have to be 
parent accounts or subaccounts. To move an account to another level, in the Chart 
of Accounts window, position your cursor over the small diamond to the left of the 
account’s name. When the cursor turns into a four-headed arrow, drag to the left or 
right so that the account is indented the same amount as the other account.
 NOTE 	 If you find two accounts with similar names but different types, those accounts might not represent 
the same thing. For instance, an expense account named Telephone Ex. probably contains your monthly telephone 
service costs, while an asset account named Telephone Eq. might represent the money you invested in a big 
telephone switch that your mega-corporation owns. In this situation, the accounts are different types and should 
be separate, although more meaningful names and descriptions would help differentiate them.
Here’s how to eliminate an extraneous account:
1.	 Switch to single-user mode, as described on page 489.
You have to be in single-user mode to merge accounts. Be nice to your fellow 
QuickBooks users by making these changes outside of working hours. If you 
have to merge accounts during the workday, remember to tell your coworkers 
they can log into the program after you’ve switched the company file back to 
multi-user mode.
2.	 Press Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window. Then, in the chart of 
accounts list, click the name of the account you want to eliminate and then 
press Ctrl+E.
The Edit Account window opens.
3.	 In the Edit Account window, change the account number and name to match 
the values for the account you want to keep.
As long as you get the letters and numbers right, QuickBooks takes care of 
matching uppercase and lowercase for you.
If you don’t remember the number and name of the account you’re keeping, 
drag the Chart of Accounts window and the Edit Account window so you can 
see both at the same time. (If QuickBooks won’t let you do that, you might have 
the One Window preference turned on; see page 643 to learn how to change 
your settings to display multiple windows.)
4.	 In the Edit Account window, click Save & Close, read the message inform­
ing you that the name is in use and asking whether you want to merge the 
accounts, and then click Yes.
In the chart of accounts list, the account you renamed disappears, and any 
transactions for that account are now associated with the account you kept.

ou may be fond of strutting around your sales department proclaiming,

products or services, the first sale to a new customer often initiates a flurry of activ­
ity, including creating a new customer in QuickBooks, assigning a job for the work, 
and the ultimate goal of all this effort—invoicing your customer (sending a bill for 
what you sold that states how much the customer owes) to collect some income.
The people who buy what you sell have plenty of nicknames: customers, clients, 
consumers, patrons, patients, purchasers, donors, members, shoppers, and so on. 
QuickBooks throws out the thesaurus and applies one moniker to every person or 
organization that buys from you: customer. In QuickBooks, a customer is a record 
of information about your real-life customer. The program takes the data you enter 
about customers and uses it to fill in invoices and other sales forms with your cus­
tomers’ names, addresses, payment terms, and other info.
Real-world customers are essential to your success, but do you need customers in 
your QuickBooks company file? Even if you run a primarily cash business, creating 
customers in QuickBooks could still be a good idea. For example, setting up Quick­
Books records for the repeat customers at your store saves you time by automatically 
filling in their information on each new sales receipt.
If your business revolves around projects, you can create a job in QuickBooks for 
each project you do for a customer. To QuickBooks, a job is a record of a real-life 
project that you agreed (or perhaps begged) to perform for a customer—remodel­
ing a kitchen, designing an ad campaign, or whatever. Suppose you’re a plumber 
and you regularly do work for a general contractor. You could create several jobs,

one for each place you plumb: Smith house, Jones house, and Winfrey house. In 
QuickBooks, you can then track income and expenses by job and gauge each one’s 
profitability. However, if your company doesn’t take on jobs, you don’t have to cre­
ate them in QuickBooks. For example, retail stores sell products, not projects. If you 
don’t need jobs, you can simply create your customers in QuickBooks and then move 
on to invoicing them or creating sales receipts for their purchases.
Even before you start receiving payments from customers, you’re going to do busi­
ness with vendors and pay them for their services and products. The telephone 
company, your accountant, and the subcontractor who installs Venetian plaster in 
your spec houses are all vendors. The information QuickBooks needs about vendors 
isn’t all that different from what you specify for customers.
This chapter guides you through creating and managing customers, jobs, and vendors 
in QuickBooks. It also helps you decide how to apply the program’s customer, job, 
and vendor fields to your business.
ALTERNATE REALITY
Tracking Donors for Nonprofits
For nonprofit organizations, any individual or organization that 
sends money is a donor, but the term “donor” doesn’t appear 
in most QuickBooks editions. The Premier Nonprofit edition of 
the program mentions donors, pledges, and other nonprofit 
terms, but QuickBooks Pro and other Premier editions focus 
single-mindedly on customers, so you may have to get used to 
thinking “donor” whenever you see “customer” in QuickBooks.
Likewise, a job in QuickBooks is the equivalent of a contract 
or grant. If you need to report on a grant or contract, add a 
separate job for it to the customer (er, donor) who donated 
the funds.
Entering members or individual donors as separate customers 
can max out QuickBooks’ customer name limit or make the pro-
gram run slowly. The Enterprise Solutions edition of QuickBooks 
can handle a larger number of customers, but most nonprofits 
would choke at that edition’s price tag. To solve this dilemma, 
create customers in QuickBooks to represent generic pools, 
such as donors and members. For example, create a customer 
called Unrestricted and then post all unrestricted donations to 
that customer. Then keep the details of your donor and member 
names in a separate donor database, spreadsheet, or program 
designed specifically for nonprofits.
Creating Customers in QuickBooks
Alas, you first have to persuade customers to work with your company. But once 
you’ve cleared that hurdle, creating those customers in QuickBooks is easy. (The 
box above describes how to use QuickBooks customer records to set up donors for 
nonprofits, and the box on page 71 provides some hints on keeping customers straight 
in QuickBooks.) The program offers several methods for creating customer records:

CREATING 
CUSTOMERS IN 
QUICKBOOKS
• QuickBooks Setup. When you’re getting started with the program, you can 
use the QuickBooks Setup dialog box to quickly import piles of customer infor­
mation (as well as vendor and employee info) from your email program or by 
copying and pasting data from Excel, as described on page 19. You can return 
to the QuickBooks Setup dialog box at any time (page 20) to add more records.
• One at a time. The New Customer window lets you create one customer at 
a time, although you can create several records in a row without closing the 
window. The next section (page 70) describes how to create customers with 
this window and explains what each customer field represents.
 TIP 	 If you don’t add customers very often, you can create a customer record when you create that customer’s 
first invoice or sales receipt: In the invoice’s or sales receipt’s Customer:Job box, type the customer’s name, and 
then press Tab to move to the next field. When you do that, the Customer:Job Not Found dialog box appears. To 
add the new customer to the Customer:Job List without filling in any other info, click Quick Add. Alternatively, 
click Set Up to open the New Customer dialog box, where you can fill in as many fields as you want. If you typed 
a nonexistent customer name by mistake, click Cancel.
• Copying data. You can also create customers in batches. With the Add/Edit 
Multiple List Entries feature (page 124), you can paste data from Excel or copy 
values from customer to customer.
• Importing data. This method is ideal when you have scads of customer records 
to set up. After you create a map between QuickBooks’ fields and fields in an­
other program, you can transfer your customer info as described on page 133.
The Customer Center (Figure 4-1) is a one-stop shop for customers and jobs: creating, 
modifying, and viewing their records, and creating transactions for them. QuickBooks 
gives you four easy ways to open the Customer Center window:
• From anywhere in the program, press Ctrl+J.
• On the QuickBooks Home Page, at the top of the Customers panel, click Cus­
tomers.
• On the QuickBooks menu bar, choose Customers→Customer Center.
• In the icon bar, click Customers.

WORD TO THE WISE
Making Customers Easy to Identify
In QuickBooks, the Customer Name and Vendor Name fields 
don’t show the names that appear on invoices or bills. Instead, 
they display a code that uniquely identifies each customer or 
vendor so you can tell them apart.
If you own a small company, you’re not likely to mistakenly 
create multiple records for the same customer or vendor. Your 
Customer and Vendor lists are short, so you can probably 
remember all the people and companies on them. Even so, 
it’s a good idea to define a standard for names.
Consistent naming can help you avoid having multiple records 
for the same customer or vendor by preventing you from 
creating slightly different values in the Customer Name or 
Vendor Name field. For example, you could end up with three 
customer records in QuickBooks all representing the same 
real-world customer, such as Cales’s Capers, Cales Capers, and 
CalesCapers. The same holds true for vendors.
QuickBooks doesn’t enforce naming conventions. So after 
you define rules that work for your business, you have to 
be disciplined and apply those rules each time you create a 
new customer or vendor. (You’re free to use alphanumeric 
characters and punctuation in names.) Here are a few of the 
more common naming conventions:
• The first few letters of the customer’s or vendor’s company 
name, followed by a unique numeric identifier. This 
standard is easy to apply and differentiates customers 
or vendors as long as their names don’t all begin with 
the same words. For example, if the companies you 
do business with aren’t imaginative, your names could 
end up as Wine001, Wine002, and Wine003. But if the 
companies are Zinfandels To Go, Merlot Mania, and 
Cabernet Cabinet, this system works nicely.
• For individuals, the person’s last name followed by a 
comma, his first name, and then a numeric ID to make the 
name unique. Although unusual names such as Zaphod 
Beeblebrox render a numeric ID unnecessary, using this 
standard ensures that all names are unique.
• The actual company name with any punctuation and 
spaces omitted. Removing spaces and punctuation from 
company names helps eliminate multiple versions of the 
same name. If you choose this convention, using capital 
letters at the beginning of each word (called camel 
caps) makes the names more readable. For instance, 
Icantbelieveitsyogurt is a headache waiting to happen, 
but ICantBelieveItsYogurt looks more like its spaced and 
punctuated counterpart.
• A unique alphanumeric code. Customer:Job drop-down 
menus and reports sort entries by the values in the 
Customer Name field of customer records. (Vendor drop-
down menus and reports sort by the Vendor Name field.) 
Codes like X123Y4JQ use only a few characters to produce 
unique identifiers, but they’re also so cryptic that they 
make it difficult to pick out the name you want in drop-
down lists, or to sort reports in a meaningful way. Stick 
with using part of the company name (at the beginning 
of the name, since names appear alphabetically) unless 
you have hundreds or thousands of customers or vendors.
 TIP 	 If you buy from and sell to the same company or individual, you probably already know that you can’t 
use the same name in the Customer, Vendor, Employee, and Other Names lists. If a customer is also a vendor, you 
need two records for that company or individual—and they have to have different names. The solution? Add text 
to the Customer Name and Vendor Name fields to identify which list the record belongs to, such as “Tek Turner 
(Cust)” in the customer record’s Customer Name field and “Tek Turner (Vend)” in the vendor record’s Vendor 
Name field. Fortunately, QuickBooks doesn’t care if the other fields in the customer and vendor records contain 
the same info.

the first tab, Address Info. All the fields related to payments are on the Payment 
Settings tab. The Sales Tax Settings tab contains fields for sales tax, so you can skip 
it entirely if you don’t sell taxable goods. The Additional Info tab holds a few miscel­
laneous fields like customer type, sales rep, and any custom fields you’ve created. 
You’ll learn about the Job Info tab on page 83. The next several sections step you 
through each tab and the fields on each one.
 NOTE 	 If you’ve turned on QuickBooks’ multiple currency option (page 656), a Currency box appears at the 
top right of the New Customer window, as shown in Figure 4-2. QuickBooks automatically fills in this box with 
your home currency, so you usually don’t have to change this value. But if the customer pays in a foreign currency, 
choose it in the Currency drop-down list. (QuickBooks creates a separate Accounts Receivable account for each 
currency you use.)

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
How Many Names?
If you’re a big fish in the small-business pond, you might bump 
up against limitations on the number of names you can add to 
your QuickBooks company file. In QuickBooks Pro and Premier 
editions, the maximum number of names you can have in the 
Customer, Vendor, Employee, and Other Names lists combined 
is 14,500. Here are a few techniques you can use to avoid max-
ing out your name lists:
• Conserve names. Be frugal with names by creating one 
customer or vendor to represent many individual sales 
or purchases. For example, you can aggregate all your 
cash sales under a single customer named Cash Sales. 
Or you can combine all your meal expenses by using a 
single vendor named Meals. Just keep in mind that, by 
doing so, you can’t produce reports by individual names. 
However, you can store a customer’s name in the Bill To 
field in sales forms or in the Memo field in a bill, check, 
or credit card charge.
• Keep an eye on how many names you have. Press F2 
anytime to call up the Product Information window so 
you can view the number of entries you have in each list. 
They appear in the List Information box on the right side 
of the window.
• Upgrade. If there’s no getting around your company’s 
gluttony for names, QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 
lets you add more than 100,000 names, although Intuit 
warns you that the program might not run as quickly as 
the number of names increases.
ENTERING CONTACT INFORMATION
If you plan to bill your customers, ship products to them, or call them to make them 
feel appreciated, address and contact information is important. You record this 
info on the New Customer window’s Address Info tab. Here’s a guide to what you 
enter on this tab:
• Company Name. Unlike the Customer Name field, where you enter whatever 
name or code you want to use to identify this customer, this field is where 
you enter the customer’s name as you want it to appear on invoices and other 
forms you create. QuickBooks automatically copies what you type here into 
the Invoice/Bill To box below.
• Full Name. To address invoices, letters, and other company communications, 
enter the primary contact’s salutation or title, first name, middle initial, and last 
name in the appropriate fields here. QuickBooks automatically copies what you 
type in these fields into the Invoice/Bill To fields. You can also fill in the Job Title 
box with this person’s title.
 NOTE 	 After you create a customer, you can add additional contacts for that customer in the Customer Center.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Opening Act
Should I add an opening balance for new customers?
Since the Opening Balance field is always visible at the top 
of the New Customer window (Figure 4-2), you might think 
you should fill it in. But you’re actually better off skipping it.
Entering an opening balance as of a specific date is a shortcut 
that eliminates having to create the invoices that generate the 
customer’s current balance. But that shortcut comes at a price: 
If customers haven’t paid, then you might have a hard time 
collecting the money they owe you, especially if you can’t tell 
them what services and products you delivered, how much they 
cost, the invoice numbers, and when the invoices were due. And 
when your customers do pay, you can’t accept those payments 
against specific invoices to track your Accounts Receivable. In 
addition, QuickBooks creates a new account in your chart of 
accounts called Uncategorized Income and creates an invoice 
that increases (debits) your Accounts Receivable account and 
increases (credits) your Uncategorized Income account by the 
amount of the opening balance you enter.
The best way to record a customer’s balance is to create 
QuickBooks invoices for the invoices the customer hasn’t paid 
yet (called “open invoices”). That way, you’ll have complete 
documentation of those sales, the corresponding balance in 
your Accounts Receivable account, and credits to the correct 
income accounts. Also, you can then apply the payments that 
come in to settle those invoices. See Chapter 10 to learn all 
about invoicing.
 TIP 	 The Address Info tab has additional fields for contact information, including four phone numbers, two 
email addresses, the company’s website, and a field labeled “Other 1.” If you look closely, you’ll notice that the 
labels for these eight fields have down arrows on them, so you can set these fields to any of 24 contact-related 
fields, such as Home Phone, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, URL 1, and Skype ID.
• Invoice/Bill To. QuickBooks uses the address you enter in this box on invoices. 
To edit this address, click the Edit button to its right (it has a pencil icon on 
it). Then, in the Edit Address Information dialog box, fill in the street address, 
city, state, country, and postal code, or paste that info from another program. 
QuickBooks automatically turns on the “Show this window again when address 
is incomplete or unclear” checkbox, which tells the program to notify you when 
you forget a field like City or when the address is ambiguous. For example, say 
you fill in the Invoice/Bill To box with “Santa Claus, North Pole.” If you then click 
Copy>> to use that address as a shipping address, QuickBooks opens the Edit 
Address Information dialog box so you can flesh out the address with a street, 
city, and arctic postal code.
 TIP 	 You can quickly enter addresses and contact info for all your customers by importing data from another 
program (page 133) or by using QuickBooks’ Add/Edit Multiple List Entries feature (page 124).
• Ship To. If you don’t ship products to this customer, you can skip this field. If 
the billing and shipping addresses are the same, click Copy>> to replicate the 
contents of the Invoice/Bill To field in the Ship To field. (The greater-than symbols

on the button indicate the direction that QuickBooks copies the address—left 
to right.) Otherwise, click the + button to this field’s right, and then fill in the 
Add Shipping Address Information dialog box.
 TIP 	 You can define more than one ship-to address for a single customer, which is perfect if that customer 
has multiple locations. To add another ship-to address, click the + button to the field’s right, and then fill in the 
Add Shipping Address Information dialog box. Once you’ve added shipping addresses, you can choose the one 
you want from the Ship To drop-down list. When the shipping address you use most often is visible, turn on the 
“Default shipping address” checkbox below the Ship To field to tell QuickBooks to pick that address automatically. 
Click the Edit button (the pencil icon to the field’s right) or the Delete button (the trash can icon) to modify or 
remove a shipping address, respectively.
ENTERING PAYMENT INFORMATION
The Payment Settings tab (Figure 4-3) is the place to indicate how the customer 
pays and how much credit you’re willing to extend.
FIGURE 4-3
Several of the fields on this 
tab use QuickBooks’ lists. 
To jump directly to the list 
entry you want, in any 
text box with a drop-down 
list, type the first few 
characters of the entry. 
QuickBooks selects the 
first entry that matches 
what you’ve typed and 
continues to reselect 
the best match as you 
continue typing. You can 
also scroll to the entry in 
the list and click to select 
it. If the entry you want 
doesn’t exist, click <Add 
New> to create it.
You can use the following fields to specify the customer’s payment info:
• Account No. Account numbers are optional in QuickBooks. Large accounting 
programs often assign unique account numbers to customers, which reduces 
the time it takes to locate a customer’s record. In QuickBooks, the Customer 
Name field works like an identifier, so you’re best off reserving the Account No. 
field for an account number generated by one of your other business systems.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

CREATING 
CUSTOMERS IN

• Payment Terms. What you select here represents the payment terms the cus­
tomer has agreed to. The entries in this drop-down list come from the Terms List 
(page 150), which QuickBooks uses for both payment terms for your customers 
and the ones you accept from your vendors. Out of the box, this list includes 
several of the most common payment terms, such as “Due on receipt” and Net 
30, but you can choose <Add New> at the top of this list to define additional 
payment terms. If you leave this field blank in a customer’s record, you have to 
choose the payment terms every time you create an invoice for that customer.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks’ payment terms are more than just labels. If you use terms like “1% 10 Net 30” and the 
customer pays within 10 days, the program is smart enough to calculate a 1 percent discount on the customer’s 
balance. 
• Preferred Delivery Method. Choose E-mail, Mail, or None to identify the 
method that your customer prefers for receiving information. If you choose 
E-mail, QuickBooks automatically turns on the E-mail checkbox when you create 
forms (such as invoices) for this customer. The Mail method is for QuickBooks 
Billing Solutions, an add-on QuickBooks service for mailing invoices (additional 
fees apply). (In QuickBooks 2015, online payment services are undergoing big 
changes, which hadn’t been finalized when this book was written. To learn about 
the new online payment services, download online Appendix E from this book’s 
Missing CD page at www.missing manuals.com/cds.) Choose None if you typi­
cally print documents and mail them the old-fashioned way. You can’t add a 
new entry to the Preferred Delivery Method list, so if you use carrier pigeons to 
correspond with your incarcerated customers, you’ll just have to choose None 
and remember that delivery method.
• Preferred Payment Method. Choose the form of payment that the customer 
uses most frequently. This drop-down list includes several common ones, such 
as Cash, Check, and Visa, but you can add others by choosing <Add New>. The 
payment method you specify automatically appears in the Receive Payments 
window (page 345) when you choose this customer. If a regular customer pays 
with a method different from the one you chose here, you can simply select 
that method in the Receive Payments window.
• Credit Card Information. For credit card payments, you can specify the cus­
tomer’s card number, the name on the card, the billing address, the Zip/postal 
code, and the expiration date. (You can enter only one credit card number for 
each customer.)
 NOTE 	 If you store customer credit card numbers in QuickBooks, turn on the Customer Credit Card Protection 
feature (choose Company→Customer Credit Card Protection, and then click Enable Protection). That way, the 
program helps you comply with credit card industry security requirements (page 721). For example, any user 
who views complete credit card information has to create a complex password. In addition, QuickBooks doesn’t 
let you store the card’s security code (the three-digit number on the back of the card) because doing so violates 
your merchant account agreement and PCI (Payment Card Industry) standards.

• Credit Limit. This is where you can specify the amount of credit that you’re 
willing to extend to the customer. If you do, then QuickBooks warns you when 
an order or invoice exceeds this customer’s credit limit, but that’s as far as it 
goes—it’s up to you to reject the order or to ship your products COD. If you 
don’t plan to enforce the credit limits you assign, then don’t bother entering a 
value in this field.
• Price Level. More often than not, customers pay different prices for the same 
product. Just think about the labyrinth of pricing options for seats on airplanes, 
for instance. In QuickBooks, price levels represent discounts or markups that you 
apply to transactions. For example, you might have one price level called Top20, 
which applies a 20 percent discount for your best customers, and another price 
level called AuntMabel that extends a 50 percent discount to your Aunt Mabel 
because she fronted you the money to start your business. (Page 144 explains 
how to define price levels.) Once you create a price level, you can tell Quick­
Books to apply it to every transaction for a customer by choosing it in this box.
 NOTE 	 In QuickBooks 2015, Intuit e-Invoicing is the new and improved online payment subscription service. 
It replaces the Online Payment service available in previous versions of QuickBooks. If you want to email invoices 
to customers and receive payments electronically, head to Appendix E (available from this book’s Missing CD page 
at www.missing manuals.com/cds) for the full scoop on Intuit e-Invoicing.
SPECIFYING SALES TAX INFORMATION
The Sales Tax Settings tab appears whether or not you turn on QuickBooks’ Sales 
Tax preference (page 664). However, if sales tax isn’t turned on, the fields on this 
tab are grayed out. If the customer pays sales tax, choose Tax in the Tax Code drop-
down list. Then, in the Tax Item drop-down list, choose the option that specifies the 
tax rate the customer pays. (Chapter 21 tells the whole story of setting up, charging, 
and remitting sales tax.)
SPECIFYING ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER INFORMATION
The New Customer window’s Additional Info tab serves up a few fields that let you 
categorize your customers. Here are the fields and some ways to use them:
• Customer Type. You might want to classify customers so you can send cus­
tomized communications to each type or determine which types are the most 
profitable. (Turn to page 87 to learn how to set up customer and job types 
and different ways to use them.) Once you’ve set up customer types, you can 
categorize a customer by choosing from this drop-down list, which displays the 
entries from your Customer Type List, such as government, health insurance, 
or private pay, if you run a healthcare company.
• Rep. Choosing a name in this field links a customer to a sales representative, 
which is helpful if you want to track sales reps’ results. But reps don’t have to be 
sales representatives: One of the best ways to provide good customer service 
is to assign a customer service rep to each customer. When you choose <Add

New> here to create a new Rep entry (page 147), you can select existing names 
from the Employee List, Vendor List, or Other Names List, or add a new name 
to one of those lists to use as a rep.
• Custom Fields. QuickBooks offers 15 custom fields, which you can use to store 
important info that QuickBooks doesn’t include fields for out of the box. Because 
custom fields don’t use drop-down lists, you have to type your entries and take 
care to enter values consistently. The box below has more about custom fields.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Defining Custom Fields for Lists
QuickBooks’ customer, vendor, employee, and item records 
include lots of fields you can fill in, but those fields may not 
cover all the information you need. For example, you might 
want to note which branch office supports a customer. Or for 
employees, you could track whether they participate in your 
company’s community service program.
QuickBooks’ answer to this issue is custom fields. After you 
create a custom field and apply it to a list, QuickBooks adds 
the custom field’s label and a text box to the Additional Info 
tab (Figure 4-4, background). You have to type your entries 
in custom field boxes each time; there’s no drop-down list or 
a way to compare it with text you entered in other records. 
So it’s up to you to make sure that your data entry is correct 
and consistent.
To set up a custom field, follow these steps:
1.	 In the appropriate New or Edit window (New Customer or 
Edit Vendor, for example), click the Additional Info tab. 
2.	 Click the Define Fields button. The “Set up Custom Fields 
for Names” dialog box (Figure 4-4, foreground) opens.
3.	 In one of the 15 Label cells, type a name for the field.
4.	 If you’re associating a custom field with a customer, 
vendor, or employee record, click the cell for the 
appropriate list (Cust, Vend, or Empl) and QuickBooks 
puts a checkmark there. For example, if the Region custom 
field applies to both the Customer:Job List and the Vendor 
List, you’d want checkmarks in both the Cust and Vend 
columns. You can associate up to seven custom fields with 
the Customer:Job List, Vendor List, or Employee List. To 
create a custom field or assign one to an item, in the New 
Item or Edit Item window, click Custom Fields. The Item 
List can have up to five custom fields associated with it.
5.	 Click OK. QuickBooks adds your custom field to the 
appropriate Additional Info tab(s).
 NOTE 	 The New Customer window also includes a Job Info tab, which (not surprisingly) has fields for job-
related information. If a customer hires you to do more than one job, skip the Job Info tab, since you’ll create 
separate jobs to track that info, as described on page 81. On the other hand, if you don’t track jobs, you could use 
this tab’s Job Status field to store the overall status of your work for the customer, although a contact-management 
or project-management program is probably more useful.

for Names” dialog box 
(which opens when you 
click Define Fields in a 
New or Edit window for 
customers, vendors, or 
employees) lets you create 
up to 15 custom fields. 
To associate a custom 
field with a customer, 
vendor, or employee, click 
the corresponding cell 
in the field’s row in the 
table. You can associate 
a custom field with one 
or more types of names; 
for example, with both 
customers and employees.
Adding More Customer Contacts
When you create a customer, you can specify information about one contact (typi­
cally the primary contact) on the New Customer window’s Address Info tab (page 
73). After you finish creating the customer’s record, you can then add more contacts 
to it. For example, you might add contacts for the person who handles day-to-day 
billing questions, the employee who resolves shipping issues, and the person to 
contact if you need to escalate a problem. You can also edit or delete contacts as 
the people you deal with change offices or transfer to new jobs.
When you select a customer in the Customer Center’s Customers & Jobs list, you see 
contact info for that customer on the right side of the window. To add more contacts 
to the customer’s record, click the Contacts tab in the window’s lower-right pane 
(Figure 4-5). To add a new contact, click Manage Contacts at the bottom of the pane, 
and then choose Add New to open the Contacts window. Then fill in the boxes, such 
as Job Title, First Name, Last Name, and so on. After you finish filling them in, click 
“Save and New” to add another contact or “Save and Close” to close the window.
 NOTE 	 The fields in the Contacts dialog box are a subset of those on the New Customer window’s Address 
Info tab. They include Job Title and Name fields, as well as five other fields that are initially set to Work Phone, 
Work Fax, Mobile, Main Email, and Additional Email. However, if you contact the person via Skype or LinkedIn, 
click the field label and then choose the appropriate type of contact info from the drop-down list to switch the 
customer field associated with that box.

Creating Jobs in QuickBooks
Project-based work means that your current effort for a customer has a beginning 
and an end (even if it sometimes feels like the project will last forever). Whether you 
build custom homes or custom home entertainment systems, you can use Quick­
Books’ job-tracking features to analyze financial performance by project (known 
as job costing). 
Suppose you want to know whether you’re making more money on the mansion 
you’re building or on the bungalow remodel, and the percentage of profit you made 
on each project. As long as you create jobs for each project you want to track, 
QuickBooks can calculate these financial measures.
 NOTE 	 If you sell products and don’t give a hoot about job tracking, you can simply invoice customers for 
the products you sell without ever creating a job in QuickBooks.

CREATING 
JOBS IN 
QUICKBOOKS
In QuickBooks, jobs cling to customers like baby possums to their mothers. A Quick­
Books job always belongs to a customer. In fact, if you try to create a job before you 
create a customer, you’ll see a message box telling you to create a customer first. 
Both the New Customer and Edit Customer windows include tabs for customer info 
and job info. So when you create a customer, in effect, you create one job automati­
cally, but you can add as many as you need. This section explains how.
Creating a New Job
Because jobs belong to customers, you have to create a customer (page 70) before 
you can create any of that customer’s jobs. Once the customer exists, follow these 
steps to add a job to the customer’s record:
1.	 In the Customer Center’s Customers & Jobs tab, right-click the customer you 
want to create a job for, and then choose Add Job from the shortcut menu.
You can also select the customer in the Customers & Jobs tab and then, in the 
Customer Center toolbar, choose New Customer & Job→Add Job. Either way, 
the New Job window opens.
2.	 In the Job Name box, type a name for the job.
This name will appear on invoices and other customer documents. You can type 
up to 41 characters in this box. The best names are short but easily recognizable 
to both you and the customer.
QuickBooks fills in most of the remaining job fields with the information you 
entered for the customer associated with this job. The only time you have to 
edit the fields on the Address Info, Payment Settings, and Additional Info tabs 
is when the information on these tabs is different for this job. For example, if 
materials for the job go to a different shipping address than the customer’s, 
type the address in the fields on the Address Info tab.
3.	 If you want to add info about the job type, dates, or status, click the Job 
Info tab and enter values in the appropriate fields.
If you add job types (page 89), you can analyze jobs with similar characteristics, 
no matter which customer hired you to do the work. Filling in the Job Status 
field lets you see what’s going on by scanning the Customer Center, as shown 
in Figure 4-6. If you want to see whether you’re going to finish the work on 
schedule, you can document your estimated and actual dates for the job in the 
Date fields; see the box on page 83 for more about these fields.
 NOTE 	 To change the values you can choose in the Job Status field, modify the status text in QuickBooks’ 
preferences (see page 655).
4.	 After you’ve filled in the job fields, click OK to save the job and close the 
New Job window.

FIGURE 4-6
When you select a job 
in the Customer Center 
(jobs are indented below 
their customers), the Job 
Information section of 
the window displays Job 
Status, Start Date, Pro-
jected End, and End Date 
(if you’ve added values to 
those fields). 
To edit info you’ve entered 
for a job, double-click the 
job’s name in the Custom-
ers & Jobs tab to open the 
Edit Job dialog box.
 TIP 	 You can create a new job for a customer right in the Create Invoices window or the Enter Sales Receipts 
window. To do so, in either window’s Customer:Job box, type the name of the existing customer, type a colon, 
and then type the name of the job. When you press Tab or click in another field, the Customer:Job Not Found 
message box opens. To simply add the new job to the Customer:Job List, click Quick Add. To open the New Job 
window so you can enter detailed job info, click Set Up instead. Or click Cancel to close the message box without 
creating a new job. (This shortcut works only if you haven’t filled in the Job Info tab of the customer’s record. If 
the customer’s Job Info tab already has data in it, then you’ll have to create the job using the New Job window.)
Setting Up Vendors
The methods for creating vendor records are similar to those for creating customers:
• QuickBooks Setup. You can use the QuickBooks Setup dialog box to quickly 
import vendor information from your email program or by copying and pasting 
data from Excel, as described on page 133.

Chapter 4: Setting Up Customers, Jobs, and Vendors
83

UP TO SPEED
Specifying Job Information
The fields on the New Job (and Edit Job) window’s Job Info tab 
are optional—you can invoice a customer for a job even if every 
one is blank. However, both the Job Status and Job Type fields 
can help you analyze your business performance, past and 
future. You don’t even have to use the terms that QuickBooks 
provides in the Job Status drop-down list; you can custom-
ize the list by adjusting the Jobs and Estimates preferences 
described on page 655.
Here’s a guide to the Job Info tab’s fields and how you can 
put them to use:
• Job Description. Here’s where you can type a detailed 
description to remind you about the work in case the 
job’s name doesn’t ring any bells.
• Job Type. If you categorize your jobs, choose the job type 
(page 89) from this drop-down menu. 
• Job Status. This field can indicate trends in your business. 
If several jobs are set to Pending status, for example, a 
resource crunch might be in your future.
• Start Date. Set this field to your projected or actual start 
date.
• Projected End. If you’ve estimated when you’ll complete 
the job, select that date here.
• End Date. When you complete the job, set this field to 
the date you actually finished up. By comparing the 
actual end date with your projection, you can improve 
future estimates or change how you work in order to 
finish jobs on time.
• One at a time. The New Vendor window lets you create one vendor at a time, 
although you can create several records in a row without closing the window. 
Page 84 describes how to create vendors with this window and explains what 
each field represents.
• Copying data. You can also create multiple vendor records with the Add/Edit 
Multiple List Entries feature (page 124), which lets you paste data from Excel 
or copy values from vendor to vendor.
 TIP 	 You can create a vendor record when you create that vendor’s first bill (page 186). Simply choose <Add 
New> in the Enter Bills window’s Vendor drop-down list.
• Importing data. This method is another fast way to create oodles of vendor 
records. After you create a map between QuickBooks’ fields and the fields in 
another program, you can transfer all your vendor info, as described on page 133.
The Vendor Center makes it a breeze to create, edit, and review vendors. It lists the 
details of your vendors and their transactions in one easy-to-use dashboard. To open 
the Vendor Center window, choose Vendors→Vendor Center or, in the Vendors panel 
of the QuickBooks Home Page, click Vendors.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

SETTING UP 
VENDORS
Creating a Vendor
You create a new vendor from the Vendor Center window by pressing Ctrl+N or, in 
the Vendor Center menu bar, by clicking New Vendor→New Vendor. Either way, the 
New Vendor window opens.
Many of the fields in this window should be familiar from creating customers in 
QuickBooks. For example, the Vendor Name field corresponds to the Customer 
Name field, which you might remember is actually more of a code than a name. Use 
the same sort of naming convention for vendors that you use for customers (see 
the box on page 71). And, as with customer records, you’re better off leaving the 
Opening Balance field blank and building your current vendor balance by entering 
the invoices or bills they send.
The following sections explain how to fill out the rest of the fields in a vendor record.
ADDRESS INFO
If you print checks and envelopes to pay your bills, you’ll need address and contact 
information for your vendors. The New Vendor window’s Address Info tab has fields 
for the vendor’s address and contact info, which are almost identical to customer 
address and contact fields, so see page 70 if you need help filling them in.
PAYMENT SETTINGS
The fields related to payments reside on the Payment Settings tab. Here are the 
fields and how you fill them in:
• Account No. When you create customers, you can assign account numbers 
to them; when it’s your turn to be a customer, your vendors return the favor 
and assign an account number to your company. If you fill in this box with the 
account number that the vendor gave you, QuickBooks prints it in the memo 
field of checks you print. Even if you don’t print checks, keeping your account 
number in QuickBooks is handy if a question arises about one of your payments.
• Payment Terms. Choose the payment terms that the vendor extended to your 
company. The entries in this drop-down list come from the Terms List (page 
150), so they’re the same as for customers.
• Print Name On Check As. QuickBooks automatically fills in this box with what­
ever you enter in the vendor’s Company Name field on the Address Info tab. 
When you print checks, QuickBooks fills in the payee field with the contents 
of this box, so to print a different name, simply edit what’s in this box. For 
example, say you hire subcontractors and fill in the Company Name field with 
last names followed by first names. You can then fill in this box with first name 
followed by last name so the payee on a check appears the way people’s names 
are usually written.
• Credit Limit. If the vendor has set a credit limit for your company (like $30,000 
from a building supply store), type that value in this box. That way, QuickBooks 

Chapter 4: Setting Up Customers, Jobs, and Vendors
85
SETTING UP 
VENDORS
warns you when you create a purchase order that pushes your credit balance 
above this limit.
• Billing Rate Level. If you use the Contractor, Professional Services, or Accoun­
tant edition of QuickBooks, this is another list that lets you set up custom billing 
rates for employees and vendors. Billing rates let you price the services you sell 
the same way a Price Level helps you adjust the prices of products you sell. Say 
you have three carpenters: a newbie, an old-timer, and a finish carpenter. You 
can set up a Billing Rate Level for each one based on experience. Then, when 
you create an invoice for your carpenters’ billable time, QuickBooks automati­
cally applies the correct rate to each carpenter’s hours.
TAX SETTINGS
QuickBooks keeps the two sales tax–related fields on the Tax Settings tab. Here’s 
what they do:
• Vendor ID. You have to put the vendor’s Employer Identification Number (EIN) 
or Social Security number in this field only if you plan to create a 1099 for this 
vendor.
• Vendor eligible for 1099. Turn on this checkbox if you’re going to create a 1099 
for this vendor (page 468).
 NOTE 	 When you hire subcontractors to do work for you, you have them fill out a W-9 form, which tells 
you the subcontractor’s Taxpayer Identification Number. Then, at the end of the year, you fill out a 1099 tax form 
that indicates how much you paid them, which they use to prepare their tax returns. See page 468 to learn how 
QuickBooks can help with 1099s.
ACCOUNT SETTINGS
When you write checks, record credit card charges, or enter bills for a vendor, you 
have to indicate the expense account to which you want to assign the payment. 
The Account Settings tab of the New Vendor (and Edit Vendor) window lets you 
tell QuickBooks which accounts you typically use. But there’s an easier approach to 
filling in expense accounts than selecting accounts on this tab: telling QuickBooks 
to automatically recall your previous transactions. That way, when you record a bill, 
check, or credit card charge for a vendor, the program creates a new transaction 
using the total amount and the accounts you chose on the previous transaction. 
Page 650 explains how to set the “Automatically recall last transaction for this 
name” preference.
ADDITIONAL INFO
This tab is rather sparse—it contains only two fields:
• Vendor Type. If you classify vendors or generate reports based on their types, 
choose an entry in this drop-down list or choose <Add New> to create a new 
type in the Vendor Type List (page 149). For example, if you assign a Tax type 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
86
WORKING WITH 
CUSTOMERS, 
JOBS, AND 
VENDORS
to all the tax agencies you remit taxes to, you can easily prepare a report of 
your tax liabilities and payments.
• Custom Fields. If you want to track vendor information that isn’t handled by 
the fields that QuickBooks provides, you can add up to seven custom fields 
here (see the box on page 78). Say your subcontractors are supposed to have 
current certificates for workers’ comp insurance, and you could be in big trouble 
if you hire one whose certificate has expired. If you create a custom field to 
hold the expiration date for each subcontractor’s certificate, you can generate 
a report of these dates.
Working with Customers, Jobs, and 
Vendors
After you create customer, job, and vendor records, you might have to come back 
to add more data or change what’s already there. For example, you can add contact 
info as you gather it over time. Or you may decide to categorize customers, jobs, 
and vendors, which is handy for slicing and dicing your financial performance to 
analyze income, expenses, profitability, and so on.
Because customers, jobs, and vendors come and go, eventually your Customer:Job 
List and Vendor List will become cluttered with people and organizations you no 
longer do business with. Hiding these obsolete names keeps your lists focused. Of 
course, if you create records by mistake, you can delete them. You can also merge 
records to, for example, combine the records of two companies that merged in real 
life. This section explains how to perform all these modifications.
Modifying Customer, Job, and Vendor Information
You can edit customer, job, and vendor records at any time after you create them. 
For example, you might change address and contact info, increase a credit limit, or 
shorten payment terms.
QuickBooks gives you a few ways to open the edit windows for these records (Edit 
Customer, Edit Job, and Edit Vendor). Here are your options:
• Edit a customer or job. In the Customer Center (choose Customers→Customer 
Center), on the Customers & Jobs tab, double-click the customer or job you 
want to tweak. Alternatively, right-click the customer or job, and then choose 
Edit Customer:Job from the shortcut menu. You can also select the customer or 
job you want to edit, and then press Ctrl+E or, on the right side of the Customer 
Center, click the Edit button (its icon looks like a pencil).
• Edit a vendor. In the Vendor Center (choose Vendors→Vendor Center), on the 
Vendors tab, double-click the vendor you want to modify. You can also right-
click the vendor and then choose Edit Vendor from the shortcut menu. Another 
method is to select the vendor in the list and then press Ctrl+E or, on the right 
side of the Vendor Center, click the Edit button (its icon looks like a pencil).

Chapter 4: Setting Up Customers, Jobs, and Vendors
87
WORKING WITH 
CUSTOMERS, 
JOBS, AND 
VENDORS
 NOTE 	 If you want to modify multiple customer, job, or vendor records at once, see page 127.
When you edit these records, you can make changes to all the fields except Current 
Balance. QuickBooks calculates that value from the opening balance (if you provide 
one) and any unpaid invoices for that customer or job (or unpaid bills for a vendor). 
Once you create a customer, job, or vendor record, QuickBooks modifies its current 
balance when you create transactions like invoices (page 226), credit memos (page 
288), bills (page 186), journal entries (page 426), or payment discounts (page 352).
You can’t change the currency assigned to a customer, job, or vendor if you’ve 
recorded any transactions for them. So if the company moves from Florida to 
France and starts using euros, you’ll need to close its current balance by receiving 
payments for outstanding customer or job invoices, or by paying a vendor’s bills. 
Then you create a new customer, job, or vendor record in QuickBooks and assign 
the new currency to it. After the new record is ready to go, you can make the old 
record inactive (page 90).
 WARNING 	 Unless you’ve revamped your naming standard (page 71), don’t edit the value in a record’s name 
field (Customer Name, Job Name, or Vendor Name). Why? Because doing so can mess up things like customized 
reports you’ve created that are filtered by a specific name; such reports aren’t smart enough to automatically 
use the new name. So if you do modify a Customer Name, Job Name, or Vendor Name field, make sure to modify 
any customizations to use the new name.
Categorizing Customers, Jobs, and Vendors
If you want to report and analyze your financial performance to see where your 
business comes from and what you spend your money on, categorizing your 
QuickBooks customers, jobs, and vendors is the way to go. For example, customer 
and job types can help you produce a report of kitchen remodel jobs that you’re 
working on for residential customers. With that report, you can order catered din­
ners to treat those clients to customer service they’ll brag about to their friends. If 
you run a construction company, knowing that your commercial customers cause 
fewer headaches and that doing work for them is more profitable than residential 
jobs is a strong motivator to focus future marketing efforts on commercial work. 
Similarly, you might categorize vendors to track what you spend with companies 
versus individual contractors or to classify vendors by geographic location. (Page 
140 explains other ways to analyze your business.)
You can add and assign customer, job, and vendor types anytime. If you don’t have 
time to add types now, come back to this section when you’re ready to learn how.
UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER, JOB, AND VENDOR TYPES
Business owners often like to look at the performance of different segments of their 
businesses. Say your building-supply company has expanded over the years to in­
clude sales to homeowners, and you want to know how much you sell to homeowners 
versus professional contractors. In that case, you can make this comparison by using 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
88
WORKING WITH 
CUSTOMERS, 
JOBS, AND 
VENDORS
customer types to designate each customer as a homeowner or a contractor, and 
then total sales by Customer Type, as shown in Figure 4-7. Job types and vendor 
types work similarly. For example, job types could help you evaluate the profitability 
of new construction, remodeling, and maintenance work. As you’ll learn on page 77, 
categorizing a customer, job, or vendor is as easy as choosing from the Customer 
Type, Job Type, or Vendor Type lists.
FIGURE 4-7

Detail report initially

To subtotal income by 
customer type (in this 
example, government, 
professional, small biz, 
and so on), click Customize 
Report in the report win-
dow’s button bar. On the 
Display tab of the dialog 
box that appears, choose 
“Customer type” in the 
“Total by” drop-down list 
(circled), and then click OK.
Types are yours to mold into whatever categories help you analyze your business. 
A healthcare provider might classify customers by their insurance, because reim­
bursement levels depend on whether a patient has Medicare, uses major medical 
insurance, or pays privately. A clothing maker might classify customers as custom, 
retail, or wholesale, because the markup percentages are different for each. And a 
training company could categorize customers by how they learned about the com­
pany’s services. This flexibility applies to job and vendor types, too.
 NOTE 	 The Class Tracking feature is a powerful way to categorize results. Classes are particularly potent 
because of their ability to cross income, expense, account, customer, job, and vendor boundaries (which types 
can’t do). To see whether classes can help you analyze your business, turn to page 140.
If you create a company file by using an industry-specific edition of QuickBooks or 
you select an industry when creating your company file (page 11), QuickBooks fills in 
the Customer Type, Job Type, and Vendor Type lists with a few types that are typical 
for your industry. If your business sense is eccentric, you can delete QuickBooks’ 

Chapter 4: Setting Up Customers, Jobs, and Vendors
89

CUSTOMERS, 
JOBS, AND 
VENDORS
suggestions and replace them with your own entries. For example, if you’re a land­
scaper, you might include customer types such as Green Thumb, Means Well, and 
Lethal, so you can decide whether orchids, cacti, or Astroturf are most appropriate.
 TIP 	 A common mistake is creating customer types that don’t relate to customer characteristics. (The same 
holds true for job types and vendor types.) For example, if you provide several kinds of services—like financial 
forecasting, investment advice, and fortunetelling—your customers might hire you to perform any or all of those 
services. So if you classify your customers by the services you offer, you’ll wonder which customer type to choose 
when someone hires you for two different services. Instead, go with customer types that describe the customer 
in some way, like Corporate, Individual, and Government.
Here are some suggestions for using customer, job, and vendor types and other 
QuickBooks features to analyze your business in different ways:
• Customer business type. Use customer types to classify your customers by 
their business sector, such as Corporate, Government, and Small Business.
• Nonprofit “customers.” For nonprofit organizations, customer types such as 
Member, Individual, Corporation, Foundation, and Government Agency can help 
you target fundraising efforts.
• Job type. Jobs are optional in QuickBooks, so job types matter only if you track 
your work by the job. If your sole source of income is selling chocolates in your 
store, jobs and job types don’t matter—your relationship with your customers 
is one long run of selling and delivering products. But for project-based busi­
nesses, job types add another level of filtering to the reports you produce. If 
you’re a writer, then you can use job types to track the kinds of documents you 
produce (Manual, White Paper, and Marketing Propaganda, for instance) and 
filter the Job Profitability Report by job type to see which forms of writing are 
most lucrative. (Page 597 describes how to filter reports.)
• Vendor type. Use vendor types to categorize vendors in different ways, such 
as by industry, location, or type of company.
• Location or region. If your company spans multiple regions, offices, or busi­
ness units, classes can help track business performance. See page 140 for info.
• Services. To track how much of your business comes from each type of service 
you offer, set up separate income accounts or subaccounts in your chart of ac­
counts, as outlined on page 50.
• Products. To track product sales, create one or more income accounts or sub­
accounts in your chart of accounts.
 TIP 	 Create income accounts for broad categories of income, such as services and products. Don’t create 
separate accounts for each service or product you sell; instead, you can use items to track sales for each service 
and product, as described in Chapter 5.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
90
WORKING WITH 
CUSTOMERS, 
JOBS, AND 
VENDORS
• Expenses. To track expenses, create one or more expense accounts or subac­
counts in your chart of accounts.
• Marketing. To identify your income based on how customers learned about 
your services, enter this info in a custom field (page 78). That way, you can 
create a report that shows the revenue you’ve earned from different marketing 
efforts—and figure out which ones are worth the money.
CREATING A VENDOR, CUSTOMER, OR JOB TYPE
You can create these types when you set up your QuickBooks company file or at 
any time after setup. See page 148 to learn how to create customer, job, and vendor 
types and subtypes. Here’s how to see the different type lists:
• Customer types: Choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Customer 
Type List.
• Job types: Choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Job Type List.
• Vendor types: Choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Vendor Type 
List.
Hiding Records
Hiding customers, jobs, and vendors isn’t about barricading them in a conference 
room when the competition shows up to talk to you. Because QuickBooks lets you 
delete these records only in very limited circumstances, hiding them helps keep your 
lists manageable and your financial history intact.
Although your work with a customer, job, or vendor might be over, you still have 
to keep records about your past relationship. But old records can clutter up your 
QuickBooks lists, making it difficult to select the people and companies you still work 
with. The solution is to hide old records, which also removes those names from all 
the lists that appear in transaction windows so you can’t select them by mistake. 
Hiding old records is better than deleting them because QuickBooks retains the 
historical transactions for those customers, jobs, and vendors so you can reactivate 
them if you renew the relationship.
To hide a customer or job, in the Customer Center’s Customers & Jobs tab, right-click 
the customer or job and then, from the shortcut menu, choose Make Customer:Job 
Inactive. The customer and any associated jobs disappear from the list. Figure 4-8 
shows you how to unhide (reactivate) customers.
To hide a vendor, in the Vendor Center’s Vendors tab, right-click the vendor and 
then, from the shortcut menu, choose Make Vendor Inactive.

FIGURE 4-8
To make hidden customers visible again and reactivate their records, in 
the drop-down list at the top of the Customers & Jobs tab, choose All 
Customers, as shown here. 
When you do that, QuickBooks displays an X to the left of every inac-
tive customer in the list. Simply click that X to restore the customer to 
active duty.
Deleting Records
You can delete customers, jobs, or vendors only if there’s no activity for them in 
your QuickBooks file. If you try to delete a record that has even one transaction as­
sociated with it, QuickBooks tells you that you can’t delete that record. In that case, 
you can still hide the customer, job, or vendor, as described in the previous section.
If you created a customer, job, or vendor by mistake and the record has no transac­
tions associated with it, here’s how to delete it:
1.	 In the Customer Center, on the Customers & Jobs tab (or in the Vendor 
Center, on the Vendors tab), select the customer, job, or vendor you want 
to delete.
2.	 Press Ctrl+D (or choose Edit→Delete Customer:Job or Edit→Delete Vendor.)
If the customer, job, or vendor has no transactions, QuickBooks asks you to 
confirm that you want to delete the record; click OK. If you see a message stat­
ing that you can’t delete it, read the previous section (page 90) to learn how 
to hide the record instead.

Merging Records
Suppose you remodeled buildings for two companies run by brothers: Morey’s City 
Diner and Les’ Exercise Studio. Morey and Les conclude that their businesses have 
a lot of synergy—people are either eating or trying to lose weight, and usually do­
ing both. To smooth out their cash flow, they decide to merge their companies into 
More or Less Body Building and All You Can Eat Buffet. Your challenge: to create one 
customer in QuickBooks from the two businesses, while retaining the jobs, invoices, 
and other transactions that you created when the companies were separate. The 
solution: QuickBooks’ merge feature, which works the same way whether you’re 
merging customers, jobs, or vendors.
 TIP 	 Here’s another instance when merging can come in handy: If you don’t use a standard naming convention 
(page 71 offers several easy conventions), you could end up with multiple customer records representing one 
real-life customer, such as Les’ Exercise Studio and LesEx. You can merge these doppelgangers into one customer 
just as you can merge two truly separate companies into one.
When you merge records in QuickBooks (customers, for example), one customer 
retains the entire transaction history for the two original customers. In other words, 
you don’t so much merge two customers as turn one customer’s records into those 
of another. If you want to merge two customers’ records into one, the secret is to 
rename one customer to the same name as another. Likewise, if you want to merge 
two jobs’ or vendors’ records into one, you rename one job or vendor to the same 
name as another.
 NOTE 	 There’s a catch to renaming customers: The customer you rename can’t have any jobs associated with 
it. So if there are jobs associated with the customer you want to rename, you have to move all those jobs to the 
customer you intend to keep before you start the merge. Your best bet: Subsume the customer with fewer jobs 
so you don’t have to move very many. (If you don’t use jobs, then subsume whichever customer you want.)
To merge customer, job, or vendor records with a minimum of frustrated outbursts, 
follow these steps:
1.	 If you work in multi-user mode, switch to single-user mode for the duration 
of the merging process.
See page 489 to learn how to switch to single-user mode and then back to 
multi-user again after the merge is complete.
2.	 Open the Customer Center or Vendor Center.
To open the Customer Center, in the Home Page’s Customers panel, click Cus­
tomers. To open the Vendor Center, in the Home Page’s Vendors panel, click 
Vendors.
3.	 If you’re going to subsume a customer that has jobs associated with it, on 
the Customers & Jobs tab, position your cursor over the diamond to the left 

Chapter 4: Setting Up Customers, Jobs, and Vendors

CUSTOMERS, 
JOBS, AND 
VENDORS
of the job you want to reassign. If you’re merging jobs or vendors instead, 
jump to step 6.
Jobs are indented beneath the customer to which they belong.
4.	 When your cursor changes to a four-headed arrow, drag the job under the 
customer you plan to keep.
As you drag, the cursor changes to a horizontal line between two arrowheads, 
as shown in Figure 4-9, left.
FIGURE 4-9

changes to a four-headed 
arrow, drag within the 
Customers & Jobs tab to 
move the job. As you drag, 
a horizontal line between 
two arrowheads shows 
you where the job will 
go when you release the 
mouse button. 
Right: After reassigning all 
the jobs to the customer 
you intend to keep, you 
can merge the now-
jobless customer into the 
other. When the merge is 
complete, you see only the 
customer you kept.
5.	 Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each job that belongs to the customer you’re go­
ing to subsume.
If the customer has hundreds of jobs, moving them is tedious at best—but move 
them you must.
6.	 For a customer or job, on the Customers & Jobs tab, double-click the name 
of the customer or job you want to subsume. For a vendor, on the Vendors 
tab, double-click the name of the vendor you want to subsume.
You can also edit a record by selecting its name on the Customers & Jobs or 
Vendors tab and then, on the right side of the Customer or Vendor Center,

LEADS
clicking the Edit button (the pencil icon). Depending on the type of record you 
selected, the Edit Customer, Edit Job, or Edit Vendor dialog box opens.
7.	 In the edit dialog box, edit the Customer Name, Job Name, or Vendor Name 
field to match the name of the record you intend to keep, and then click OK.
QuickBooks displays a message letting you know that the name is in use and 
asking if you want to merge the records.
8.	 Click Yes to complete the merge.
In the Customer or Vendor Center, the record you renamed disappears and any 
balances it had now belong to the remaining entry, as shown in Figure 4-9, right.
Managing Leads
Suppose you attend a tradeshow and return to your office with a stack of leads. If 
you want to turn those leads into new sales, you usually have a host of to-dos, like 
following up on the questions that prospects asked, sending out more info about 
your products and services, or simply taking the next step in your sales process. The 
information you collect about leads is similar to that for customers, but leads aren’t 
customers—yet. If your lead-tracking needs are simple, QuickBooks’ Lead Center 
can help you track prospects while you’re trying to turn them into customers. Then, 
if your persuasion pays off, you can transform leads into customers in QuickBooks.
To work with leads, open the Lead Center by choosing Customers→Lead Center. The 
Lead Center looks a lot like the Customer Center with a few exceptions. The Leads 
list on the left shows the leads’ names and status. And because leads don’t have 
transactions, the tabs at the bottom of the Lead Center focus on to-dos, contacts, 
locations, and notes.
 NOTE 	 The Lead Center’s features aren’t as powerful as the ones you find in market-leading customer 
relationship management (CRM) programs. For example, you can’t send an email to a lead from the Lead Center 
or create an estimate for a lead. But if your leads are scribbled in a notebook or listed in a spreadsheet, the Lead 
Center can help you organize them—and because it’s built into QuickBooks, it doesn’t cost extra. 
If you need more sophisticated lead-tracking tools, skip the Lead Center and check out CRM programs that inte­
grate with QuickBooks. You can find a few dozen listed at the Intuit marketplace (http://tinyurl.com/7xntgpe). 
QuickBooks also integrates with Salesforce, a major CRM provider. You can learn about this program in the Lead 
Center window by clicking the “Learn about Salesforce” button to the right of the Lead Information heading.
Here are some of the actions you can perform with leads:
• Create a new lead. In the Lead Center toolbar, click New Lead. In the Add Lead 
dialog box, name the lead. The Status field lets you classify leads as Hot, Warm, 
or Cold, so you know which ones to focus on first. The Company tab contains 
fields for info such as company name, telephone number, email address, website, 
and main address. (You can add other addresses if the company has several

LEADS
locations.) The Contacts tab lets you add contact info for people in the company. 
The first contact you enter is designated the Primary Contact, but you can add 
other contacts by clicking the Add Another Contact button.
 NOTE 	 After you create a lead, you can add more contacts or locations to it by double-clicking it on the left 
side of the Lead Center to open the Edit Lead dialog box.
• View leads. Like the Customer Center, the Lead Center lists your leads on the 
left side of the window. The list shows the leads’ names and status. You can 
filter the list by choosing an entry from the drop-down menu above the lead 
list. For example, choose Active Leads to see all the leads you’re working on, 
or choose Hot to filter the list for all your most promising leads.
• Search leads. If your sales team is prolific, your lead list could be quite long. 
You can search for specific leads by typing part of the lead’s name in the unla­
beled text box above the lead list and then clicking the magnifying glass icon. 
QuickBooks filters the list to show all the leads that contain the text you typed.
• Edit a lead. After you create a lead, you can view its information and edit it. 
Simply double-click the lead in the list on the left side of the Lead Center.
• Create a to-do. To add a to-do for a lead, select the lead in the Lead Center’s 
list. Next, click the To Do’s tab at the bottom right of the Lead Center, and then 
click To Do at the bottom of the tab. (See page 478 to learn how to create dif­
ferent types of to-dos.) The To Do’s tab shows info about that lead’s to-dos, 
including the type of to-do, its priority, when it’s due, and whether it’s complete.
• Add notes. To add notes about a lead, first select the lead in the Lead Center’s 
list. Next, click the Notes tab at the bottom right of the Lead Center, and then 
click Add Notes. In the “Note For [customer]” dialog box, type the information 
you want to record. For example, you might specify the particular products or 
services that lead is interested in or her budget. When you add a note, Quick­
Books automatically records the date you wrote it. To filter the notes by date, 
choose a time period in the Notes tab’s Date drop-down list.
• Convert a lead to a customer. Leads are stored in a separate list from your 
customers. When you turn a lead into a customer in real life, you can easily do 
the same in QuickBooks. Simply right-click the lead in the Lead Center’s list and 
choose “Convert to a Customer” in the shortcut menu (or click the “Convert 
this Lead to a Customer” button in the Lead Center’s upper right). QuickBooks 
asks you to confirm this action, because you can’t undo it. When you click OK, 
the lead disappears from the Active Leads list. You can see the leads you’ve 
converted to customers by choosing Converted Leads from the drop-down 
list at the top left of the Lead Center. Although you can still view converted 
leads in the Lead Center, you can no longer edit them there. They now appear 
as customers in the Customer Center, and you can edit them there as you do 
other customers (page 86).

CHAPTER
5
W
hether you build houses, sell gardening tools, or tell fortunes on the In­
ternet, you’ll probably use items in QuickBooks to represent the products 
and services you sell. But to QuickBooks, things like subtotals, discounts, 
and sales tax are items, too. In fact, nothing appears in the body of a QuickBooks 
sales form (such as an invoice) unless it’s an item.
Put another way, to create invoices (which you’ll learn how to do in Chapter 10), 
sales receipts, and other sales forms in QuickBooks, you need customers and items. 
(You can also use items to fill in the bills and other purchase forms you record.) So, 
now that you’ve got your chart of accounts, customers, jobs, and vendors set up in 
QuickBooks, it’s time to dive into items.
This chapter begins by helping you decide whether your business is one of the few 
that doesn’t need items at all. But if your organization is like most and uses business 
forms like invoices, sales receipts, and so on, the rest of the chapter will teach you 
how to create, name, edit, and manage the items you add to forms. You’ll then learn 
how to use items in invoices and other forms in the remaining chapters of this book.
What Items Do
For your day-to-day work with QuickBooks, items save time and increase consistency 
on sales and purchase forms. Here’s the deal: Items form the link between what 
you sell (and buy) and the income, expense, and other types of accounts in your 
chart of accounts. When you create an item, you describe what the item is, how 
much you pay for it, how much you sell it for, and the accounts to which you post 
the corresponding income, expense, cost of goods sold, and asset value. You also

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

WHAT ITEMS 
DO
create items for other stuff you add to sales forms, like discounts, shipping charges, 
and subtotals.
For example, say you charge $75 an hour for the bookkeeping service you provide, 
and you want that income to show up in your Financial Services income account. In 
that case, you’d create an item for bookkeeping and associate it with your income 
account. That way, when you add the item to a sales form, QuickBooks automatically 
multiplies the price per hour by the number of hours to calculate the full charge, and 
then posts the income to your Financial Services account. 
Items make it easy to look at your company’s finances from different perspectives. 
You can set up your chart of accounts based on the accounts you want to show 
on your financial statements (page 443), which are usually summarized to include 
only what your bankers or other interested parties need to know. Items also let you 
track income and expenses to the level of detail you want. For example, you might 
set up two income accounts: one for services and one for products. However, you 
can create items for every type of service and product you sell.
When it’s time to analyze how your business is doing, items shine. QuickBooks 
has built-in item-based reports that show the dollar value of sales by item or the 
number of inventory units you’ve sold. (To learn how to use inventory reports, see 
page 534. Other item-based reports are described throughout this book.) You can 
work out which accounts to assign items to on your own or with the help of your 
accountant (a good idea if you’re new to bookkeeping), and then specify those 
accounts in your items, as shown in Figure 5-1. QuickBooks remembers these as­
signments from then on.
FIGURE 5-1
If you had to enter item 
details each time you 
added an entry to an 
invoice, you’d be bound 
to make mistakes. But by 
setting up an item using 
this window, you can make 
sure you use the same 
information on sales and 
purchase forms each time 
you sell or buy that item. 
(When the inevitable ex-
ception to the rule arises, 
you can edit the item info 
that QuickBooks fills in on 
the sales form.)

WITH ITEMS?
When You Don’t Need Items
Without items, you can’t create any type of sales form in QuickBooks, including 
invoices, statements, sales receipts, credit memos, and estimates. But if you don’t 
use sales forms, you don’t need items. Not many organizations operate without 
these forms, but here are a few examples of ones that do:
• Old Stuff Antiques sells junk—er, antiques—on consignment. Kate, the owner, 
doesn’t pay for the pieces; she just displays them in her store. When she sells 
a consignment item, she writes paper sales receipts. She deposits the money 
customers hand over into her checking account and writes checks to sellers for 
their cut of the proceeds.
• Tony owns a tattoo parlor specializing in gang insignias. He doesn’t care how 
many tattoos he creates and—for safety’s sake—he doesn’t want to know his 
customers’ names. All Tony does is deposit the cash he receives upon complet­
ing each masterpiece.
• Dominic keeps the books for his charity for iceberg-less penguins. The charity 
accepts donations of money and fish, and it doesn’t sell any products or perform 
services to earn additional income. He deposits the monetary donations into the 
charity’s checking account and enters each deposit in QuickBooks. He keeps 
track of the donors’ contributions and his frozen fish inventory in a spreadsheet.
Should You Track Inventory with Items?
If your business is based solely on selling services, you can skip this section. But if 
you sell products, keep reading to understand your options.
You can handle products in two ways: by stocking and tracking inventory or by 
buying products only when work for your customers requires them. The approach 
you use affects the types of items you create in QuickBooks.
If you buy products specifically for customers, you need items, but you don’t have to 
track the quantity on hand. In this case, you create Non-inventory Part items, which 
you’ll learn about shortly. For example, caterers prepare meals for various types of 
events, so they usually purchase the materials and food they need for a specific job 
and charge the customer for those goods. Because caterers don’t keep food in stock, 
they don’t have to track inventory and can therefore use Non-inventory Part items.
On the other hand, grocery stores sell the same kinds of food products over and 
over. These businesses purchase goods and store them in their stores, selling them to 
their customers each day. These goods can be set up as Inventory Part items (page 
519) in QuickBooks. When you use the program’s inventory feature, QuickBooks 
keeps track of how many products you have on hand, increasing the number as 
you purchase them and decreasing the number when you sell them to customers.

SHOULD 
YOU TRACK 
INVENTORY 
WITH ITEMS?
So, before you start working with items in QuickBooks, you actually have two in­
ventory decisions to make: First, should you track inventory? And second, should 
you track inventory in QuickBooks? Read on to learn how to make these decisions.
Because tracking inventory requires more effort than buying only the materials 
you need, use the following guidelines to determine whether your business should 
track inventory:
• Track inventory if you keep products in stock to resell to customers. If your 
company stocks faux pony placemats to resell to customers, those placemats 
are inventory. By tracking inventory, you know how many units you have on 
hand, how much they’re worth, and how much money you made on the place­
mats you’ve sold.
On the other hand, the faux pony mousepads you keep in the storage closet for 
your employees are business supplies. Most companies don’t bother tracking 
inventory for supplies like these, which they consume in the course of running 
their business.
• Track inventory if you want to know when to reorder products so you don’t 
run out. If you sell the same items over and over, keeping your shelves stocked 
means more sales (because the products are ready to ship out as soon as an 
order comes in). QuickBooks can remind you when it’s time to reorder a product.
• Don’t track inventory if you purchase products specifically for jobs or cus­
tomers. If you special-order products for customers or buy products for specific 
jobs, you don’t need to track inventory. After you deliver the special order or 
complete the job, your customer has taken and paid for the products, and you 
simply have to account for the income and expenses you incurred.
• Don’t track inventory if you rent equipment to customers. If you receive 
income from renting or leasing assets you own, then you can show the value 
of the for-rent products as an asset in QuickBooks and the rental income as a 
Service item (page 108), so you don’t need Inventory Part items.
Your business model might dictate that you track inventory. However, QuickBooks’ 
inventory-tracking feature has some limitations. For example, it lets you store only 
14,500 items, max. How can you tell whether QuickBooks’ inventory fits the bill? If 
you answer yes to any of the following questions, then QuickBooks isn’t the program 
to use to handle the products you sell:
• Do you sell products that are unique? In the business world, tracking inven­
tory is meant for businesses that sell commodity products, such as electronic 
equipment, and stock numerous units of each product. If you sell unique items, 
such as fine art or compromising Polaroid photos, you’d eventually hit Quick­
Books’ 14,500 item limit. For such items, consider using a spreadsheet to track 
the products you have on hand.

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
101
SHOULD 
YOU TRACK 
INVENTORY 
WITH ITEMS?
 TIP 	 Here’s one way to handle unique products using QuickBooks: When you sell your unique handicrafts, 
record the sales in QuickBooks using generic Non-inventory Part items. For example, use an item called Oil Painting 
on the sales receipts for the artwork you sell and put more specific information about the painting in the sales 
receipt’s Description field.
• Do you manufacture the products you sell out of raw materials? QuickBooks’ 
inventory can’t follow materials as they wend through a manufacturing process 
or track inventory in various stages of completion.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise editions can track inventory for products that require some as­
sembly. For instance, if you create Wines from Around the World gift baskets using the wine bottles in your store, 
you can build an Inventory Assembly item (page 522) out of wine and basket Inventory Part items. The box on 
page 524 explains another way to track assembled inventory.
• Do you value your inventory using a method other than average cost? Quick­
Books Pro and Premier calculate inventory value by average cost. If you want to 
use other methods—like last in/first out (LIFO) or first in/first out (FIFO)—you 
can export inventory data to a spreadsheet program and then calculate inven­
tory cost there (page 688). Or you can upgrade to QuickBooks Enterprise and 
subscribe to Intuit’s Advanced Inventory add-on service (which costs extra).
• Do you use a point-of-sale system to track inventory? Point-of-sale inven­
tory systems often blow QuickBooks’ inventory tracking out of the water. If you 
forgo QuickBooks’ inventory feature, then you can periodically update your 
QuickBooks file with the value of your inventory from the point-of-sale system.
 NOTE 	 If you like the point-of-sale idea but don’t have a system yet, consider Intuit’s QuickBooks Point of 
Sale, an integrated, add-on product for retail operations that tracks store sales, customer info, and inventory. 
Head to http://pointofsale.intuit.com for details.
You don’t have to use QuickBooks’ inventory feature if you don’t want to. For example, 
if you perform light manufacturing, you can track the value of your manufactured 
inventory in a database or other program. You can then periodically add journal 
entries (page 426) to QuickBooks to show the value of in-progress and completed 
inventory.
If you do opt to use QuickBooks to track inventory, Chapter 20 shows you how, 
from first step to last.
 TIP 	 The answer to your inventory dilemma could be an add-on program that tracks inventory and keeps 
QuickBooks informed. One of the best is FishBowl Inventory (www.fishbowlinventory.com).

PLANNING 
YOUR ITEMS
Planning Your Items
Setting up items in QuickBooks is a lot like shopping at a grocery store. If you need 
only a few things, you can shop without a list. Similarly, if you’re going to use just a 
few QuickBooks items, you don’t need to write them down before you start creating 
them. But if you use dozens or even hundreds of items, planning your Item List can 
save you lots of frustration.
 NOTE 	 If you jumped straight to this section, now is the time to go back and read page 99, which helps you 
decide whether to use items that represent services, inventory, or non-inventory products.
By deciding how to name and organize your items before you create them in Quick­
Books, you won’t waste time editing and reworking existing items to fit your new 
naming scheme. Read on to learn what you should consider before creating items.
Generic or Specific?
Conservation can be as important with QuickBooks’ items as it is for the environment. 
QuickBooks Pro and Premier can hold no more than 14,500 items, which is a problem 
if you sell unique products, such as antiques, or products that change frequently, 
such as current clothing styles for teenagers. Once you use an item in a transaction, 
you can’t delete that item, so you could end up with lots of items you no longer 
use. By planning how specific your items will be, you can keep your Item List lean.
For instance, a generic item such as Top can represent a girl’s black Goth T-shirt one 
season and a white, poplin button-down shirt the next. Generic items have their limi­
tations, though, so use them only if necessary. For example, you can’t track inventory 
properly when you use generic items. QuickBooks might show that you have 100 
tops in stock, but that doesn’t help when your customers are clamoring for white 
button-downs and you have 100 black Goth T-shirts. In addition, the information 
you store with a generic item won’t match the specifics of each product you sell. 
So, when you add generic items to an invoice or a sales form, you’ll have to edit a 
few fields, such as Description or Price, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Naming Items
Brevity and recognizability are equally desirable characteristics in item names. Short 
names are easier to type and manage, but they can be unintelligible. Longer names 
take more effort to type and manage but are easier to decipher. Decide ahead of 
time which kind of name you prefer, and then stick with it as you create items.
QuickBooks encourages brevity because it limits item names to 31 characters (includ­
ing spaces). If you sell only a handful of services, you can name your items the same 
things you call them. For instance, for a tree service company, names like Cut, Limb, 
Trim, Chip, and Haul work just fine. But if your Item List runs into the hundreds or 
thousands, some planning is in order. Here are factors to consider when naming items:

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
103
PLANNING 
YOUR ITEMS
FIGURE 5-2
QuickBooks automatically 
fills in fields like Descrip-
tion and Price (or Rate, 
as shown here) with 
values you’ve saved in 
item records. But you can 
edit those fields once you 
add an item to an invoice 
or bill, whether you use 
generic or specific items 
to describe what you sell. 
Just click a field in a form, 
select the text you want to 
change, and then type the 
new value.
• Aliases. Create a pseudonym to represent the item. For a carpet company, “In­
stall standard” could represent the installation along with vacuuming and hauling 
waste, while “Install deluxe” could include the standard installation plus moving 
and replacing furniture. You can include the details in the item’s description.
• Sort order. In the Item List window (Lists→Item List), QuickBooks sorts items 
first by type and then in alphabetical order by name. So if you want your items 
to appear in some logical order in drop-down lists (like an invoice item table), 
pay attention to the order of characteristics in your item names. For example, if 
you created “Deluxe install” and “Standard install” Service items, other Service 
items beginning with the intervening letters of the alphabet would separate 
them in drop-down lists. By naming your installation items “Install deluxe” and 
“Install standard” instead, they’ll show up in your Item List one after the other.
• Abbreviations. If you have to compress a great deal of information into an item 
name, you’ll have to abbreviate. For example, suppose you want to convey all 
the things you do when you install a carpet, including installing tack strips, 
padding, and carpet; trimming carpet; vacuuming; and hauling waste. That’s 
more than the 31 characters you have to work with. Poetic won’t describe it, but 
something like “inst trim vac haul” says it all in very few characters. The box on 
page 104 suggests two other ways to identify complicated items.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
104
PLANNING 
YOUR ITEMS
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Other Ways to Identify Items
If you want to keep item names lean but still include detailed 
information, look to these two item features:
• Descriptions. Items have fields for both names and 
descriptions. When you create an invoice, you choose the 
item’s name from a drop-down list, but the invoice that 
the customer sees shows the item’s description. So you 
can keep your item names brief by putting the details in 
the Description field, which, for all practical purposes, can 
hold an unlimited amount of text.
• Group. Instead of creating one item that represents 
several phases of a job, you can create separate items 
for each phase and then create a Group item (page 114) 
to include those phases on an invoice. For instance, create 
one item for installing tack strips, padding, and carpet, 
and then create additional items for vacuuming, hauling, 
and moving and replacing furniture. Then create a Group 
item that contains all the individual Service items included 
in a carpet-installation job. That way, when you add that 
Group item to an invoice, QuickBooks adds each Service 
item to a line on the invoice. A Group item isn’t limited to 
just Service items, though. It can include other types of 
items, such as Non-inventory Part, Inventory Part, and 
Other Charge items.
 NOTE 	 Construction companies in particular can avoid long hours of item data entry by using third-party 
estimating programs. Construction-estimating programs usually include thousands of entries for standard con­
struction services and products. If you build an estimate with a program that integrates with QuickBooks, you 
can import that estimate into QuickBooks and then sit back and watch as it automatically adds all the items in 
the estimate to your Item List. To find such QuickBooks-integrated programs, go to http://marketplace.intuit.
com. On the menu bar, click Find Software→Find Solutions by Industry. Then, on the By Industry tab, choose 
Construction/Contractors.
Subitems
If you keep all your personal papers in one big stack, you probably have a hard time 
finding everything from birth certificates to tax forms to bills and receipts. If you’ve 
got one big list of items in QuickBooks, you’re in no better shape. To locate items 
more easily, consider designing a hierarchy of higher-level items (parents) and one 
or more levels of subitems, as shown in Figure 5-3. The box on page 105 explains 
how to make sure you have items for every purpose.
For example, a landscaping business might create top-level items for trees, shrub­
bery, cacti, and flower bulbs. Within the top-level tree item, the landscaper might 
create subitems for several species: maple, oak, elm, sycamore, and dogwood. You 
can create up to five levels of subitems to represent categories such as size (seedling, 
established, and mature, say).

the window to display the

If you work with long lists

the screen. To keep the

at all times, choose Flat

uses colons to separate 
the names of each level of

WORD TO THE WISE
Catchall Subitems
When you develop a hierarchy of parent items and subitems, 
eventually someone in your company will run across a service 
or product that doesn’t fit any of the existing subitems. If you 
assign a transaction to a parent item that has subitems, then 
QuickBooks automatically creates a subitem called “Other” 
as a catch basin. For example, if you have a parent item 
called Security Services, you’d get a subitem called Security 
Services-Other.
Catchall items can act as holding pens while you figure out 
which specific subitem you should use. They’re also an easy 
way to look for transactions that should be reassigned to a 
different subitem. For instance, you can create a transaction 
by using the Security Services-Other item, and then change the 
item in the transaction later (page 293) when you’ve identified 
(or created) the correct subitem.

CREATING 
ITEMS
Creating Items
The best time to create items is after you’ve created your accounts but before you 
start purchasing goods from vendors or invoicing customers. Each item links to an 
account in your chart of accounts, so creating items goes quicker if you can choose 
existing accounts.
You can create items while you’re in the midst of creating an invoice, but you’ll find 
that creating items goes much faster when you create several at once. How long it 
takes to create items depends on how many you need. If you sell only a few services, 
a few minutes should do it. On the other hand, construction companies that need 
thousands of items can save hours of data entry by importing items from third-party 
programs (see page 681).
 NOTE 	 This section shows you how to create items one at a time. To learn how to quickly create multiple 
items, jump to page 124.
Each item type has its own assortment of fields, but the overall process of creating 
an item is the same for every type. With the following procedure under your belt, 
you’ll find that you can create many of your items without further instruction. (If 
you do need help with fields for a specific item type, read the sections that follow 
to learn what each field does.)
1.	 On the QuickBooks Home Page, click Items & Services (or choose Lists→Item 
List) to open the Item List window.
When you first display the Item List, QuickBooks sorts the entries in it by type. 
The sort order for the item types isn’t alphabetical—it’s the order that types 
appear in the Type drop-down list, as shown in Figure 5-4. You can change the 
Item List’s sort order by clicking a column heading.
2.	 Press Ctrl+N or click Item→New.
QuickBooks opens the New Item window and selects Service in the Type drop-
down list. (You’ll learn about the various item types starting on page 108.)
3.	 To create a Service item, just press Tab to proceed with naming the item. To 
create any other type of item, choose it in the Type drop-down list.
Some item types won’t appear in the list if you haven’t turned on the corre­
sponding feature. For example, the Inventory Item type doesn’t appear unless 
you’ve turned on inventory tracking.
4.	 In the Item Name/Number box, type a unique identifier for the item.
For example, if you opt for long and meaningful names, you might type Install 
carpet and vacuum. For a short name, you might type Inst Carpt. See page 102 
for guidelines on naming items.

FIGURE 5-4
QuickBooks lists items 
by type and then in 
alphabetical order within 
each type. 
You can change the list’s 
sort order by clicking a 
column heading. If you 
click the heading again, 
QuickBooks toggles the list 
between ascending and 
descending order. 
To return the list to being 
sorted by type, click the 
diamond to the left of the 
column headings (circled), 
which appears anytime the 
list is sorted by a column 
other than Type.
5.	 To make this item a subitem, turn on the “Subitem of” checkbox, and then 
choose the item that you want to act as the parent.
If the parent item already exists, simply choose it from the “Subitem of” drop-
down list. To create the parent while creating the subitem, choose <Add New> 
at the top of the “Subitem of” list, and then jump back to step 3 to begin the 
parent-creation process.
 NOTE 	 Subitems and parents have to be the same type, and you can’t create subitems for Subtotal, Group, 
or Payment items.
6.	 Complete the other fields as described in the following sections for the type 
of item you’re creating.
QuickBooks will use the info you enter to fill in these fields on sales and purchase 
forms. For example, it uses the sales price you enter here on invoices when you 
sell some units. If the sales price changes each time, simply leave the item’s sales 
price field (which is labeled Rate, Price, or Sales Price depending on the type of 
item and the item’s settings) set to zero. That way, QuickBooks doesn’t fill in a 
price, so you can type one in each time you sell the item. (Even if you set a value 
for an item, you can overwrite it whenever you use that item on a sales form.)

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

SERVICE ITEMS
 NOTE 	 You have to assign an account to every item, whether it’s a parent item or not.
7.	 If you have additional items to create, click Next to save the current item 
and start another. If you want to save the item you just created and close 
the New Item window, click OK.
If you’ve made mistakes in several fields or need more information before you 
can complete an item, click Cancel to throw away the current item and close 
the New Item window.
Service Items
Services are intangible things you sell, like time or the output of your brain. For 
example, you might sell consulting services, Internet connection time, haircuts, or 
tarot card readings. In construction, services could represent phases of construc­
tion, which makes it easy to invoice customers based on progress and to compare 
actual values with estimates.
Suppose you run a telephone answering service. You earn income when your custom­
ers pay you for the service. You pay salaries to the people who answer the phones, 
regardless of whether you have two service contracts or 20. For this business, you 
earn income with your service, but your costs don’t link to the income from specific 
customers or jobs.
On the other hand, in some companies, such as law practices, the partners get paid 
based on the hours they bill, so the partners’ compensation is an expense associated 
directly with the firm’s income. Services that you farm out to subcontractors work 
similarly. If you offer a 900 number for gardening advice, you might have a group of 
freelancers who field the calls and whom you pay only for their time on the phone. 
In these scenarios, you still earn income for the service you sell, but you also have to 
pay the law-practice partners or the subcontractors who do the work. The partners’ 
or subcontractors’ cost relates to the income for that service. 
The mighty Service item single-handedly manages all types of services, whether 
you charge by the hour or by the service, with associated expenses or without. 
Conveniently, QuickBooks displays different fields depending on whether a service 
has costs associated with income. This section describes the fields you fill in when 
creating Service items.
Service Items Without Associated Costs
Here’s how the fields in the New Item window work when you’re creating a Service 
item that doesn’t include purchasing services from someone else (that is, when you 
leave the “This service is used in assemblies or is performed by a subcontractor or 
partner” checkbox turned off, as shown in Figure 5-5):

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
109
SERVICE ITEMS
• Description. Type a detailed explanation of the service in this box. This text 
appears on invoices and sales forms, so use terms that your customers will 
understand.
FIGURE 5-5
If a service doesn’t have 
costs directly associated 
with it, you define only its 
description, rate, tax code, 
and income account.
• Rate. Type how much you charge customers for the service. You can enter a flat 
fee or a charge per unit of time. For example, you might charge $9.95 per call, 
charge by the minute, or charge $200 for unlimited calls each month. When 
you add the item to an invoice, QuickBooks multiplies the quantity by the sales 
price to calculate the total charge.
If the item’s cost varies, leave the Rate set to 0; you can then enter the price 
when you create an invoice or other sales form. If the rate is often the same, fill 
in the most common rate. Then, when you add the item to an invoice, you can 
modify the rate if you want to use a different amount. For services that carry a 
flat fee, use a quantity of 1 on your invoices.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks multiplies the rates by the quantities you add to sales forms. Be sure to define the rate in 
the same units (by hours or days, for example) so that QuickBooks calculates your income and expenses correctly.
• Tax Code. Most Service items are nontaxable, so you’ll choose Non here more 
often than not. (This field appears only if you’ve turned on the sales tax feature, 
as described on page 547.)
• Account. Choose the income account to which you want to post the income 
for this service, whether it’s a catchall income account for all your services or 
one you created specifically for this type of service.
Service Items with Associated Costs
If you sell services that have associated costs, such as when you hire someone else 
to perform those services, you have to set up the Service item to include those costs. 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

SERVICE ITEMS
The key to displaying the fields you need to fill in is the “This service is used in as­
semblies or is performed by a subcontractor or partner” checkbox, which is turned 
on in Figure 5-6. In addition to the basics like Item Name/Number and “Subitem of,” 
here are the fields you fill in when an item does have associated costs:
• Description on Purchase Transactions. Type in the description that you want 
to appear on the purchase orders you issue to subcontractors or vendors and 
the bills you record in QuickBooks to go with the ones you receive from vendors.
FIGURE 5-6
If subcontractors or 
partners perform the 
service and get paid for 
their work, a Service item 
has to contain information 
for both the sales and 
purchase transactions. In 
that case, turn on the “This 
service is used in assem-
blies or is performed by a 
subcontractor or partner” 
checkbox to display the 
fields shown here.
• Cost. Enter what you pay for the service, which can be an hourly rate or a flat 
fee. For example, if a subcontractor performs the service and receives $175 for 
each hour of work, type 175 in this field. If the cost varies, leave this field set to 
0; you can enter the actual cost when you create a purchase order.
• Expense Account. Choose the account where you want to post what you pay 
for the service. If a subcontractor does the work, choose a Cost of Goods Sold 
account or an expense account for subcontractor or outside consultants’ fees. 
If a partner or owner performs the work, choose a Cost of Goods Sold account 
or an expense account for service-related costs.
• Preferred Vendor. If you almost always use the same vendor for a service, 
choose that vendor in this drop-down list. That way, if you don’t select a vendor 
when you create a purchase order, QuickBooks selects that vendor when you 
add this Service item. However, if you purchase the item from several vendors, 
leave this field blank.
• Description on Sales Transactions. This field appears on sales forms like in­
voices and sales receipts. QuickBooks automatically copies the text from the 
Description on Purchase Transactions box into this field, but if your vendors 

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
111
PRODUCT 
ITEMS
use technical jargon that your customers wouldn’t recognize, you can change 
the text in this box to something more meaningful.
• Sales Price. Type in how much you charge customers for the service, as you 
would in the Rate field for a Service item that you don’t purchase from someone 
else (page 109).
• Tax Code. Most Service items are nontaxable, so you’ll choose Non here most 
of the time. (This field appears only if you’ve turned on QuickBooks’ sales tax 
feature, as described on page 547.)
• Income Account. Choose the income account to which you want to post the 
income for this service, whether it’s a catchall income account for all services 
or one you created specifically for this type of service.
Product Items
Products you sell to customers fall into three categories: ones you keep in inventory, 
ones you special order, and ones you assemble. QuickBooks can handle inventory 
as long as your company passes the tests on page 100. Likewise, products you pur­
chase specifically for customers or jobs are no problem. But to handle products you 
assemble like gift baskets or gizmos made from widgets, you’ll need QuickBooks 
Premier or Enterprise edition (which include Inventory Assembly items [page 522]).
This section describes the three types of product items that QuickBooks offers and 
shows you how to fill in the New Item window’s fields for Non-inventory Part items. 
See Chapter 20 for the full scoop on creating inventory-related items.
Choose one of these three QuickBooks item types for the products you sell:
• Non-inventory Part. If you purchase products specifically for a job or customer 
and don’t track how many products you have on hand, use Non-inventory Part 
items. Unlike Inventory Part items, this type has at most two account fields: one 
for income you receive when you sell the part, and another for the expense of 
purchasing the part in the first place.
• Inventory Part. Use this type for products you purchase and keep in stock for 
resale. Retailers and wholesalers are the obvious examples of inventory-based 
businesses, but other types of companies like building contractors may track 
inventory, too. With Inventory Part items, you can track how many you have, 
how much they’re worth, and when you should reorder.
 NOTE 	 You can create Inventory Part items only if you turn on QuickBooks’ inventory feature as described 
on page 519.
• Inventory Assembly. This item type (available only in QuickBooks Premier 
and Enterprise editions) is perfect when you sell products built from your 
inventory items. For example, say you stock wine bottles and related products 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
112
PRODUCT 
ITEMS
like corkscrews and glasses, and you assemble them into gift baskets. With an 
Inventory Assembly item, you can track the number of gift baskets you have on 
hand, as well as the individual inventory items that go into them. You can also 
assign a different price to the gift basket than the total of the individual products.
Non-Inventory Part Fields
You’ll need Non-inventory Part items if you use purchase orders to buy supplies 
or other products that you don’t track as inventory. For example, suppose you’re 
a general contractor and you buy materials for a job. When you use Non-inventory 
Part items, QuickBooks posts the cost of those products to an expense account and 
the income from selling them to an income account. You don’t have to bother with 
an inventory asset account because you transfer ownership of these products to the 
customer almost immediately. (See page 192 to learn how to charge your customer 
for these reimbursable expenses.)
The good news is that Non-inventory Part items use all the same fields as Service 
items (page 108), although there are a few subtle differences you need to know. Take 
the following disparities into account when you create Non-inventory Part items:
• This item is used in assemblies or is purchased for a specific customer:job. 
This checkbox goes by a different name than the one for Service items, but its 
effect is the same. Turn it on when you want to use different values on purchase 
and sales transactions for items you resell. When this checkbox is on, QuickBooks 
displays Purchase Information and Sales Information sections, like the ones 
shown in Figure 5-6 (page 110). For Non-inventory Part items, choose income 
and expense accounts you set up specifically for products.
If the Non-inventory Part item is for office supplies (or other items you don’t 
resell) that you want to place on a purchase order, then leave this checkbox off 
because you won’t have sales values. Read on to find out what happens when 
you turn off this checkbox.
• Account. If you don’t resell this product, leave the “This item is used in assem­
blies or is purchased for a specific customer:job” checkbox turned off, and you’ll 
see only one Account field. QuickBooks considers the account in this field the 
expense account for the purchase.
• Tax Code. This field works exactly the same way as it does for a Service item. 
Choose Non if the products are nontaxable (like groceries), and Tax if they’re 
taxable. (This field appears only if you’ve turned on QuickBooks’ sales tax 
feature, as described on page 547.)
 TIP 	 Many companies don’t bother with purchase orders—forms that record what you order from a ven­
dor—when buying office supplies. But if you want to track whether you receive the supplies you bought, you can 
create purchase orders for them (page 523). Then use Non-inventory Part items for supplies you add to purchase 
orders but don’t track as inventory. (Purchase orders are non-posting transactions [page 57], so they don’t affect 
the balances in your accounts.)

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
113
OTHER TYPES 
OF ITEMS
Other Types of Items
If a line on a sales form isn’t a service or a product, read this section to figure out 
the type of item you need. (Chapter 21 covers setting up Sales Tax items.)
Other Charge
The Other Charge item type is aptly named because you use it for any charge 
that isn’t quite a service or a product, like shipping charges, finance charges, or 
bounced-check charges. Other Charge items can be percentages or fixed amounts. 
For example, you could set up shipping charges that are the actual cost of shipping, 
or calculate shipping as a percentage of the product cost.
If customers hold back a percentage of what they owe until you complete their jobs 
satisfactorily, create an Other Charge item for the retainer (the portion of your fee 
that the customer doesn’t initially pay). Then, when you create the invoice, enter a 
negative percentage so QuickBooks deducts the retainer from the invoice total. When 
your customer approves the job, create another invoice, this time using another Other 
Charge item named Retention, to charge the customer for the amount she withheld.
 TIP 	 Progress invoices (page 284) are another way to invoice customers for a portion of a job. They’re ideal 
if you invoice the customer based on the percentage of the job you’ve completed or on the parts of the job that 
are complete.
Other Charge items can be linked to expenses—or not. Here are your options:
• A charge linked to expenses. For Other Charge items, the checkbox for hiding 
or showing both purchase and sales fields is labeled “This item is used in as­
semblies or is a reimbursable charge.” Turn on this checkbox when you want to 
set the Cost field to what you pay and the Sales Price field to what you charge 
your customers. You’ll see the same sets of fields for purchases and sales as 
you do for Service and Non-inventory Part items.
• A charge without associated expenses. You can create charges that don’t 
link directly to expenses by leaving the “This is used in assemblies or is a 
reimbursable charge” checkbox turned off. You can then create a percentage-
based charge, which is useful for calculating shipping based on the value of 
the products being shipped. With the checkbox turned off, instead of the Cost 
and Sales Price fields, you see the “Amount or %” field. If you want to create a 
charge for a specific amount (like the value for a country club’s one-time initia­
tion fee), type a whole or decimal number in this field, as shown in Figure 5-7. 
To create a percentage-based charge, type a number followed by “%,” such as 
10%, in this field instead.
 NOTE 	 When you add a percentage-based Other Charge item to an invoice, such as shipping, QuickBooks 
applies the percentage to the previous line in the invoice. So if you want to apply the Other Charge percentage to 
several items, then add a Subtotal item (explained next) to the invoice on the line above the Other Charge item.

OF ITEMS
FIGURE 5-7
To create a percentage-
based charge, type a 
number followed by “%” in 
the “Amount or %” field. 
To set a dollar value 
instead, type a number 
without the percent 
symbol, as shown here.
Subtotal
You’ll need a Subtotal item if you discount only some of the items on a form or 
calculate shipping based on the value of the order. You need to create only one 
Subtotal item in QuickBooks, because a Subtotal item does just one thing: totals all 
the amounts of the preceding lines up to the last subtotal or the beginning of the 
invoice. That means you can add more than one subtotal to an invoice. For example, 
you can use one Subtotal item to add up the services you sell before applying a 
preferred-customer discount, and a second Subtotal item for product sales when 
you have to calculate shipping.
Because you can’t change a Subtotal item’s behavior, Subtotal items have just two 
fields: Item Name/Number and Description. You can type any name and description 
you wish in these fields, but in practically every case, Subtotal says it all.
Group
Group items are great timesavers, and they’re indispensable if you tend to forget 
things. As the name implies, a Group item represents several related items you often 
buy or sell together. Create a Group item that contains items that always appear 
together, such as each service you provide for a landscaping job. That way, when 
you add the Landscaping Group item to an invoice, QuickBooks automatically adds 
the Service items for the various phases, such as Excavation, Grading, Planting, 
and Cleanup. You can also use a Group item to show or hide the underlying items, 
which is useful when you create fixed-price invoices (page 240) and don’t want the 
customer to see the underlying details.

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
115
OTHER TYPES 
OF ITEMS
Here’s how you fill in the New Item window’s fields for a Group item:
• Group Name/Number. Type a name for the group that gives a sense of the 
individual items within it, such as Security Package.
• Description. Type the description that you want to appear on sales forms.
• Print items in group. To show all the underlying items on your invoices, turn on 
this checkbox. Figure 5-8 shows an invoice that prints all the items in a group 
(top) and what an invoice looks like when you leave this checkbox turned off 
(bottom).
FIGURE 5-8
Top: If you turn on the 
“Print items in group” 
checkbox when you create 
a Group item (Security 
Package, in this example) 
and then add it to an 
invoice, QuickBooks lists 
the individual items it 
contains. 
Bottom: If you leave the 
“Print items in group” 
checkbox turned off, you’ll 
see the individual items 
in the Create Invoices 
window, but the invoice 
you print to send to the 
customer will list only the 
Group item itself, along 
with the total price for all 
the items in the group.
• Item. To add an item to a group, click a blank cell in the Item column, shown in 
Figure 5-9, and then choose the item you want. You can also create a new item 
by choosing <Add New> from the drop-down list.
• Qty. Group items can include different quantities of items, just like a box of 
notecards usually includes a few more envelopes than cards. For each item in 
the group, type how many you typically sell as part of that group. If the quantity 
of each item varies, type 0 in the Qty cells. You can then specify the quantities 
on your invoices after you add the Group item.

OTHER TYPES 
OF ITEMS
FIGURE 5-9
When you work on a Group 
item in the New Item or 
Edit Item window, the 
background of the Descrip-
tion column is shaded to 
indicate that you can’t edit 
those cells. That’s because 
QuickBooks fills in the 
Description cells with the 
contents of each individual 
item’s Description field. To 
edit them, you have to edit 
the items themselves (as 
described on page 118).
Discount
As you know, a discount is an amount you deduct from the standard price you 
charge, such as a volume discount, customer-loyalty discount, or sale discount. 
QuickBooks’ Discount item calculates deductions like these. Discount items deduct 
either a dollar amount or a percentage for discounts you apply at the time of sale. 
By using both Subtotal and Discount items, you can apply discounts to some or all 
of the charges on a sales form. 
 NOTE 	 Early payment discounts don’t appear on sales forms because you won’t know that a customer pays 
early until long after that form is complete. So instead, you apply early payment discounts in the Receive Pay­
ments window, described on page 352.
The New Item window’s fields for a Discount item are similar to those of an Other 
Charge item with a few small differences:
• Amount or %. To deduct a dollar amount, type a positive number (whole or 
decimal) in this field. To deduct a percentage, type a whole or decimal number 
followed by “%,” like 5.5%.
• Account. Choose the account to which you want to post the discounts you apply. 
You can post discounts to either an income or expense account. When you post 

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
117
OTHER TYPES 
OF ITEMS
discounts to an income account, they appear as negative income, so your gross 
profit reflects what you actually earned after deducting them. Posting discounts 
to an expense account, on the other hand, makes your income look better than 
it actually is, but the discounts increase the amount in your expense account, 
so your net profit is the same no matter which approach you use.
• Tax Code. Most of the time, you choose a taxable code in this field (which 
appears only if you have the program’s sales tax features turned on) so that 
QuickBooks applies the discount before it calculates sales tax. For instance, if 
customers buy products on sale, they pay sales tax on the sale price, not the 
original price. If you choose a nontaxable code in this field, QuickBooks applies 
the discount after it calculates sales tax. You’ll rarely want to do this, though, 
because it means you’ll collect less sales tax from customers than you have to 
send to the tax agencies.
Payment
When customers send you payments, you can record them in QuickBooks using the 
Receive Payments feature (page 345). But if you’re in the middle of creating invoices 
when the checks arrive, you can avoid that task by recording those payments right 
in your invoices by adding a Payment item. As Figure 5-10 explains, Payment items 
do more than just reduce the amount owed on the invoice.
FIGURE 5-10
A Payment item (here, 
a check) reduces the 
balance on an invoice by 
the amount the customer 
paid and performs the 
same actions as the 
Receive Payments feature: 
deposits the funds into a 
bank account or groups 
the payment with other 
undeposited funds.
In the New Item window, after you fill in the Type, Item Name/Number, and Descrip­
tion fields, the remaining Payment item fields are unlike those for other items. These 
unique fields tell QuickBooks the method of payment that the customer used and 
whether you deposit the funds in a specific bank account or group them with other 
undeposited funds. Here are the details:
• Payment Method. Choose a method such as cash, check, or a brand of credit 
card. That way, when you choose Banking→Make Deposits (page 368) to make 
a deposit and the “Payments to Deposit” window opens, you can filter pending 
deposits by payment method.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
118
WORKING 
WITH ITEMS
• Group with other undeposited funds. Choose this option if you want to add 
the payment to other payments you’ve received. For example, choose this 
option if you save up the checks customers send so you can make one trip to 
deposit them all in your bank. That way, when you add this Payment item to 
a sales form, QuickBooks adds the payment to the list of undeposited funds. 
To actually complete the deposit of all your payments, choose Banking→Make 
Deposits (page 368).
• Deposit To. If payments flow into an account without any action on your part, 
such as credit card or electronic payments, choose this option, and then choose 
the appropriate bank account in the drop-down list.
Working with Items
Item info changes from time to time: Prices increase or decrease, descriptions change, 
or you decide to use different accounts. You can make changes like this anytime. 
In addition, you can hide items so only the ones you currently sell appear in item 
drop-down lists. And if you created an item by mistake, you can delete it to remove 
it permanently. This section explains how to perform all these tasks.
Modifying Items
You can change information about an item even if you’ve already used it in transac­
tions. The changes you make don’t affect existing transactions, but when you create 
new transactions using that item, QuickBooks uses the updated info.
In the Item List window (Lists→Item List), double-click the item you want to edit, 
and QuickBooks opens the Edit Item window. Simply make your changes, and then 
click OK. If you want to modify several items at once, use the Add/Edit Multiple List 
Entries feature (page 124 in Chapter 6) instead.
 NOTE 	 If you change an account associated with an item (like the income account to which sales post), the 
Account Change dialog box appears when you save the edited item. This dialog box tells you that all future transac­
tions for that item will use the new account. If you also want to change the account on all existing transactions 
that use the item, consult with your accountant to make sure that change is OK before you click Yes. Click No to 
keep the old account on existing transactions that use the item.
Be particularly attentive if you decide to change an item’s Type field. You can change 
only Non-inventory Part and Other Charge items to other item types, and you can 
change them only into certain other item types: Service, Inventory Part, Inventory 
Assembly (available only in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise), Non-inventory Part, 
or Other Charge. For example, you can’t change a Non-inventory Part item back once 
you change it to an Inventory Part item. To prevent type-change disasters, back up 
your QuickBooks file (see page 495) before switching item types.

Chapter 5: Setting Up Items
119
WORKING 
WITH ITEMS
 TIP 	 The inventory you keep in stock is an asset of your company, but Non-inventory Parts show up simply 
as expenses. So if you change a Non-inventory Part item to an Inventory Part item, be sure to choose a date in 
the “As of” field that’s after the date of the last transaction that uses the item in its non-inventory guise.
Hiding Items
Hiding items and deleting them are two totally different actions, although the visible 
result is the same: QuickBooks doesn’t display the items in the Item List window or 
in item drop-down lists, which prevents you from selecting them accidentally and 
keeps your Item List more concise. But unlike deleting (which you’ll learn about in 
a sec), hiding is reversible: You can switch items back to active status if you start 
selling them again. Suppose you hid the item for bell-bottom hip-huggers in 1974. 
Decades later, now that ’70s fashions have become cool again, you can reactivate 
that item and use it on sales forms. (Of course, you’ll probably want to edit the cost 
and sales price to reflect today’s economy.)
If you’ve sold an item in the past, then the only way to remove it from the Item List 
is to hide it—QuickBooks won’t let you delete items that have transactions associ­
ated with them.
Here’s a guide to hiding and reactivating items:
• Hide an item. In the Item List, right-click the item and choose Make Item Inactive 
from the shortcut menu. The item disappears from the list.
• View all items, active or inactive. At the bottom of the Item List window, turn 
on the “Include inactive” checkbox. (This checkbox is grayed out when all your 
items are active.) QuickBooks then displays a column with an X as its heading 
and shows an X in that column for every inactive item in the list.
• Reactivate a hidden item. First, turn on the “Include inactive” checkbox to 
display all items. Then click the X next to the name of the item you want to 
reactivate. When you click the X next to a parent item, QuickBooks opens the 
Activate Group dialog box. If you want to reactivate all the subitems as well as 
the parent, click Yes; to reactivate only the parent item, click No.
Deleting Items
The only time you’ll delete an item is when you create it by mistake and want to 
eliminate it permanently. You can delete an item only if it doesn’t have any transac­
tions associated with it.
If you erroneously create an item and catch your mistake immediately, deleting the 
offender is no sweat. Open the List Item window (Lists→Item List), and then use 
one of these methods:
• Select the item, and then press Ctrl+D.
• Right-click the item, and then choose Delete Item from the shortcut menu.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
120
WORKING 
WITH ITEMS
• Select the item, and then head to the main QuickBooks menu bar and choose 
Edit→Delete Item.
• At the bottom of the Item List window, click Item→Delete Item.
 TIP 	 If you delete an item, you have only one shot at undoing the deletion: You can restore the deleted item 
by immediately choosing Edit→Undo. If you do anything else in QuickBooks after deleting an item, that item is 
gone for good—unless you recreate it from scratch.
If you try to delete an item that’s used in even one transaction, QuickBooks warns you 
that you can’t delete it. Say you created an item by mistake and then compounded 
the problem by inadvertently adding the item to an invoice. When you realize your 
error and try to delete the item, QuickBooks refuses to oblige. Fortunately, it’s pretty 
easy to run a report to find the transactions that contain that item, and then replace 
it with another item:
1.	 Open the Item List window (Lists→Item List), and then right-click the item 
and choose “QuickReport: [item name]” from the shortcut menu.
QuickBooks opens the Item QuickReport window. Depending on how your 
report preferences are set, the Modify Report dialog box might open as well.
2.	 If the Modify Report dialog box appears, then on the Display tab, choose 
All at the top of the Dates drop-down list, and then click OK.
If the Modify Report dialog box doesn’t appear, in the Item QuickReport window, 
choose All in the Dates drop-down list.
3.	 In the report window, double-click the transaction, and then edit the trans­
action to remove the erroneous item.
QuickBooks opens the dialog box or window that corresponds to the type of 
transaction you double-clicked. For example, if you double-click an invoice, 
QuickBooks opens the Create Invoices window and displays the invoice you 
chose. In the Create Invoices window’s Item column, click the cell containing 
the item you want to delete, click the down arrow in that cell, and then choose 
the replacement item from the Item drop-down list.
4.	 To save the transaction with the revised item, click Save & Close.
The transaction window closes.
5.	 In the button bar at the top of the report window, click Refresh to update 
the report with the change you just made.
You’ll know that you’ve successfully eliminated the item from all sales transac­
tions when the Item QuickReport window shows no transactions.

6.	 To close the report window, click the X at its upper right.
QuickBooks takes you back to the Item List window.
7.	 In the Item List window, select the item you want to delete, and then press 
Ctrl+D. In the Delete Item message box that appears, click OK to confirm 
that you want to get rid of the item.
The item disappears from your Item List for good, and you’re ready to get back 
to work.

CHAPTER

I
f you frequently add or edit more than one customer, vendor, or item at a time, 
working in a New or Edit window (like New Customer or Edit Item) isn’t only te­
dious, but it also takes up time you should spend on more important tasks, like 
selling, managing cash flow, or finding out who has the incriminating pictures from 
the last company party.
When you set up your company file, the QuickBooks Setup dialog box helps you 
bring information in from an email program or Excel (page 19), and you can use 
that same window anytime you want to add more customers or vendors. Another 
option is the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries feature, which you can use to paste data 
from Excel into QuickBooks when you’re creating customers, vendors, or items. 
Or, to edit existing records, you can filter or search the list in that window to show 
just the customers, vendors, or items you want to update, and then paste in Excel 
data, type in values, or copy values between records. This chapter shows you how 
to perform all these tasks.
Then again, you might store info about customers, vendors, and items in other pro­
grams such as a database or word-processing program where you create mailing 
labels. If your other programs can create Excel-compatible files or delimited text files, 
you can avoid data-entry grunt work by transferring data to or from QuickBooks. 
(Delimited text files are simply files that separate each piece of data with a comma, 
space, tab, or other character.) In both types of files, the same kind of info appears 
in the same position in each line or row, so QuickBooks (and other programs) can 
pull the information into the right places. When you want to transfer a ton of data 
from another program into QuickBooks, importing is the way to go. By mapping 
QuickBooks’ fields to the fields in the other program, you can quickly transfer hun­
dreds or even thousands of records. In this chapter, you’ll learn about the keywords

QuickBooks uses to put your data into the correct fields and how to get your import 
file set up to work with QuickBooks. The chapter wraps up by explaining the steps 
for importing data into your company file. (Chapter 26 provides the full story on 
importing and exporting data.)
Adding and Editing Multiple Records
The Add/Edit Multiple List Entries feature is a great tool for adding or updating values 
in the Customer, Vendor, and Item lists. If you have data in an Excel spreadsheet, you 
can paste it directly into a table in the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window. The 
window’s features for copying or duplicating values between records come in handy 
when you need to make changes like updating the billing address for a customer 
who sends you job after job. (Typing values into the window’s cells works, too.) And 
you can customize the window’s table to show only the customers, vendors, or items 
you want to edit and the fields you want to modify.
This feature goes by different names depending on where you find it in QuickBooks. 
Choose it in any of these locations to open the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window:
• In the Lists menu, choose Add/Edit Multiple List Entries. When you go this 
route, QuickBooks sets the window’s List box to Customers.
• In the Customer Center toolbar, click New Customer & Job→Add Multiple 
Customer:Jobs or Excel→Paste from Excel. QuickBooks sets the List box to 
Customers.
• In the Vendor Center toolbar, click New Vendor→Add Multiple Vendors or 
Excel→Paste from Excel. QuickBooks sets the List box to Vendors.
• At the bottom of the Item List window (page 107), click Item→Add/Edit 
Multiple Items or Excel→Paste from Excel. QuickBooks sets the List box to 
Service Items.
Selecting a List to Work With
As mentioned above, if you open the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window from 
the Customer Center, Vendor Center, or Item List window, QuickBooks automatically 
selects the appropriate list in the List drop-down menu at the window’s top left. You 
can switch lists by choosing Customers, Vendors, Service Items, Inventory Parts, or 
Non-inventory Parts from this drop-down menu.
 TIP 	 If you set up jobs for customers, the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window’s table includes rows for both 
customers and jobs. The Name column contains the customer’s name for a customer row and the job’s name for 
a job row. Usually, you can spot job rows by looking at the Company Name field, since all jobs for that customer 
will have the customer’s Company Name value listed here.

Customizing the Table’s Columns
To paste data from Excel in a jiffy, take a minute to get the columns in the Add/Edit 
Multiple List Entries window’s table in the same order as the columns in your Excel 
spreadsheet. (Or, if you’re an Excel whiz, you may prefer to rearrange the columns 
in your spreadsheet.) You can customize the table in QuickBooks by clicking Cus­
tomize Columns in the window’s upper right to open the Customize Columns dialog 
box shown in Figure 6-1.
FIGURE 6-1
In addition to adding and 
removing columns, the 
Customize Columns dialog 
box (foreground) also lets 
you change the position 
of a column by selecting 
it in the Chosen Columns 
list and then clicking Move 
Up or Move Down. If you 
completely mangle the 
columns, click Default to 
restore the original ones. 
When you click OK, the 
Customize Columns 
dialog box closes, and 
the changes you made 
are reflected in the table 
(background).
Here are the table customizations you can make:
• Add a column. Select the field you want in the Available Columns list, and then 
click Add. The field jumps over to the Chosen Columns list.
• Remove a column. Select a field in the Chosen Columns list, and then click 
Remove. The field moves back over to the Available Columns list. You can’t 
remove required fields like Name; QuickBooks grays out the Remove button if 
you select a required field in the Chosen Columns list.
• Reorder columns. In the Chosen Columns list, select the field you want to move 
to a different position in the table, and then click Move Up or Move Down to 
move the field up or down in the list. Moving a field up in the list positions the 
field farther to the left in the table; moving it down in the list pushes the field’s 
column farther to the right in the table.

ADDING AND 
EDITING 
MULTIPLE 
RECORDS
Displaying the Records You Want
In addition to customizing the columns in the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window’s 
table, you can also control which records the table displays. For example, editing 
entries is easier if you filter the list to display only the ones you want to edit. Here 
are some ways to control what you see in the table:
• Filter the entries. The View drop-down menu includes several choices for 
filtering the list. Choose the Active entry (Active Customers, Active Vendors, 
Active Service Items, and so on) if you want to make changes to only active 
records in your company file. Choosing the Inactive entry (Inactive Customers, 
Inactive Inventory Items, and so on) displays only records that you’ve set to 
inactive status (page 90).
Because QuickBooks doesn’t save the changes you make in the Add/Edit Mul­
tiple List Entries window until you click Save Changes, you can filter by Unsaved 
Customers (or Unsaved Vendors or Unsaved Items) to see all the entries you’ve 
edited but haven’t yet saved.
Choosing the entry that ends in “with errors” displays only entries that contain 
invalid values, like a vendor type or tax code that doesn’t exist in your company 
file. If you click Save Changes when there are records with errors, QuickBooks 
automatically filters the list to the “with errors” view so you can see what you 
need to correct before you can save your changes. Page 132 explains how to 
spot and fix errors.
To filter the list to your exact specifications, choose Custom Filter, and then fill 
in the dialog box shown in Figure 6-2 (foreground). For example, if you want to 
divide your government customers into local, state, and federal groups, you can 
filter the list to show only records with “Government” in their customer fields.
To clear a custom filter or the search criteria you typed in the Find box (explained 
next), simply click the red X to the right of the Find box.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks is quite literal in its searches, so the entries you see in your search results exactly match 
what you specified in your custom filter or typed in the Find box. For example, if you type New York, QuickBooks 
displays customer records that contain that exact phrase, but not ones that use the abbreviation NY. Or if you type 
(555) to look for the 555 area code, records that don’t have parentheses around the area code won’t show up.
• Find entries. Typing a word, value, or phrase in the window’s Find box is similar 
to applying a custom filter to the list, except that QuickBooks searches all fields. 
For example, if you type 555 in the Find box and then click the Search button 
(which has a magnifying glass on it), QuickBooks displays records that contain 
555 anywhere, whether it’s in the company name, telephone number, address, 
or account number field.

127
ADDING AND 
EDITING 
MULTIPLE 
RECORDS
FIGURE 6-2
In the Custom Filter dialog 
box, you can type a word, 
value, or phrase to look 
for, and specify the fields 
you want QuickBooks to 
search. 
For example, type cia in 
the For field and set the 
“in” drop-down list to “All 
common fields” to find 
customers with “cia” in 
fields like Name, Company 
Name, and so on.
After you search for one value, you can search for something else within the 
results from the first search. For example, you could do an initial search for 
customers with “Texas” in their addresses, and then search within those results 
to zero in on customers in Dallas. To do so, type the second search value in the 
Find box, turn on the “Search within results” checkbox, and then press Enter 
or click the Search button (the magnifying glass).
• Sort the list entries. To sort the entries in the table, click the column heading 
for the field you want to sort by, and QuickBooks sorts the records in ascending 
order (from A to Z or from low to high numbers). Click again to sort in descend­
ing order. When the table is sorted by the values in a given column, a small 
triangle appears to the right of that column’s heading. The triangle points up 
when the column is sorted in ascending order and down when the values are 
sorted in descending order.
Adding or Editing List Entries
Whether you want to add new entries or edit existing ones, the Add/Edit Multiple List 
Entries window offers several handy options. You can type in values or use features 
like Copy Down to copy values between records. If your data is in an Excel spread­
sheet, pasting the info from Excel into the table is a breeze. (When you want to add 
a new record, you first have to click the first empty row at the bottom of the list.) 
This section explains how to enter data directly in the table or paste it from Excel.

ADDING AND 
EDITING 
MULTIPLE 
RECORDS
ENTERING DATA DIRECTLY IN THE TABLE
For an edit here and a new entry there, the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries table helps 
take the tedium out of data entry. Here are the various ways to enter values in records:
• Type values in cells. This method is straightforward: Click a cell and make 
your changes. When you click a cell that already contains data, the program 
automatically selects the cell’s contents so you can start typing to replace the 
existing value. You can also use common editing techniques like dragging to 
select text or clicking to position your cursor in the text.
• Copy and paste data within the table. You can also copy and paste data from 
one cell in the table to another. For example, if a customer with several jobs has 
relocated its main office, you can copy values from Bill To cells and paste them 
into the cells for the customer’s jobs. When you copy and paste data within the 
table, you can copy only one cell at a time. Right-click the cell you want to copy 
and then choose Copy on the shortcut menu. Then right-click the cell into which 
you want to paste the data and choose Paste on the shortcut menu. Keyboard 
shortcuts work, too: Press Ctrl+C to copy a cell and Ctrl+V to paste the copied 
data. If you want to move the data from the original cell to a new home, use 
Ctrl+X to cut the data rather than copy it.
 TIP 	 If you want to copy several cells in the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries table, it’s quicker to make the 
changes in an Excel spreadsheet and then paste the data from Excel into the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries table 
(page 129).
• Duplicate a row. To create a new record that has many of the same values as an 
existing record, right-click a cell in the existing row, and then choose Duplicate 
Row from the shortcut menu. The new record appears in the row below the 
original and contains all the same values as the original record, except that the 
value in the first field begins with “DUP” to differentiate it from the original. 
First, edit the Name cell to reflect the new name. Then edit the cells in the row 
that have different values.
• Copy values down a column. You can quickly fill in several cells in a column 
by using the Copy Down feature. Because this feature copies data into all cells 
below the one you select, it’s important to filter the list (page 126) to show only 
the records you want to change. Then right-click the cell you want to copy down 
the column and choose Copy Down from the shortcut menu. QuickBooks copies 
the value in the selected cell to all the cells below it in the column, overwriting 
any existing data. For example, if you want to change the contact name for 
all the jobs for a particular customer, filter the list to show just the records for 
that customer (in the Find box, type the customer’s name, and then click the 
magnifying glass icon). Next, type the new contact into the first Contact cell. 
Then right-click that cell and choose Copy Down.
• Insert a row. If you want to insert a blank line in the table (to create a new 
job for a customer, for example), right-click the row that’s currently where you 

Chapter 6: Data Entry Shortcuts for Lists
129
ADDING AND 
EDITING 
MULTIPLE 
RECORDS
want the blank line, and then choose Insert Line from the shortcut menu (or 
press Ctrl+Insert).
• Delete a row. If you created a record by mistake, you can get rid of it by right-
clicking anywhere in its row and then choosing Delete Line. (This command is 
grayed out if the entry is used in a transaction or other record, because you 
can’t delete a record if it’s referenced somewhere else in your company file.)
• Clear a column. To clear all the values in a column, right-click in the column, and 
then choose Clear Column from the shortcut menu. If you chose this command 
by mistake, you can undo the deletion by clicking the window’s Close button 
and then, in the Unsaved [list name] message box, clicking No.
COPYING AND PASTING VALUES FROM EXCEL
If you’re a fan of copying and pasting (and who isn’t?), you can copy data from 
an Excel spreadsheet (a single cell, a range of cells, one or more rows, or one or 
more columns) and paste it into the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries table. The only 
requirement is that the rows and columns in the table and in the spreadsheet have 
to contain the same information in the same order. You can rearrange the rows and 
columns either in the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window (page 125) or in Excel, 
whichever you prefer.
If you want to copy and paste customers and jobs (or items with subitems), you 
first have to create the top-level entries, as shown in Figure 6-3. That’s because 
jobs you paste include the name of the customer in their Company Name fields (for 
items, the parent item’s name appears in the “Subitem of” field). Once the parent 
entries exist, you can use the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window again to paste 
jobs (or subitems).
 NOTE 	 To prevent errors when you copy and paste data, make sure the values you reference—such as ac­
counts, tax codes, and so on—already exist in your company file.
Here’s how to get started with entering data via the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries 
window, using items as an example:
1.	 On the QuickBooks Home Page, in the Company panel, click Items & Services.
The Item List window opens.
2.	 Right-click the Item List window, and then choose Add/Edit Multiple Items 
from the shortcut menu. (Alternatively, at the bottom of the window, click 
Item→Add/Edit Multiple Items.)
The Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window opens with the List box set to Ser­
vice Items or the type of item you selected the last time you used this window. 
The table initially displays the active items for the type selected in the List box 
(Figure 6-4), which makes sense because you typically want to add or edit items 
that you’re currently using. To filter the list to show specific kinds of items, in 
the View drop-down menu, choose the kind you want.

way, the company name

If you don’t create the par-
ent items first, QuickBooks 
will display an error mes-
sage when you try to paste 
the jobs or subitems.

3.	 If you want to work with a different type of item, in the List drop-down 
menu, choose Customers, Vendors, Service Items, Inventory Parts, or Non-
inventory Parts.
The columns in the table vary depending on the list you select and the pref­
erences you’ve turned on. For example, for Service items, the table includes 
columns for Item Name, Subitem of, Sales Price, Income Account, and—if you’ve 
turned on the sales tax preference (page 547)—Sales Tax Code. If you’ve turned 
on the preference for inventory (page 653) and choose Inventory Parts, you see 
a COGS Account column, among others. If you choose the Customers or Vendors 
list, the table initially displays contact info and a few other fields. (See page 125 
to learn how to customize the columns that appear in the table.)
4.	 Switch to Excel and copy the data you want from your spreadsheet.
As explained earlier, the order of the columns in the Add/Edit Multiple List 
Entries window’s table and your Excel spreadsheet have to match or you’ll see 
errors when you paste the data (which you’ll do in the next step). To fix that, 
reorder the columns in either Excel or QuickBooks (page 125). When the pro­
grams’ columns match, in Excel, select the information you want to paste into 
QuickBooks, and then press Ctrl+C to copy it.
5.	 Back in the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window, click the first blank Item 
Name cell (or Name cell, if you’re pasting customer or vendor info), and 
then press Ctrl+V (or choose Edit→Paste in the main QuickBooks menu bar).
When you paste Excel data into existing records in the Add/Edit Multiple List 
Entries window, QuickBooks overwrites the existing values in the cells. To paste 
Excel data into new records, be sure to select the first empty row in the window’s 
table before pasting the data.
QuickBooks pastes the copied data into the selected cell and then continues 
pasting into the cells below and to the right of the selected cell. Cells that contain 
data with errors, such as invalid values or list entries that don’t exist in Quick­
Books, appear in red text. See page 132 to learn how to correct these errors.
 TIP 	 If you want to paste parent items and subitems into the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window’s table, 
paste the top-level items first, and then click Save Changes. Then follow with a separate paste pass for each 
subsequent level of your Item List. (For customers with jobs, paste the customers first, and then paste their jobs 
on a second pass.) That way, the parent items you need will already exist so the subitems will paste in without 
errors.
Saving Changes
After you’ve completed the additions and modifications you want in the Add/Edit 
Multiple List Entries window, click Save Changes to save your work. QuickBooks 
saves all the entries that have no errors and tells you how many records it saved.

Correcting Errors
If you try to save changes and QuickBooks finds any errors, like a value that doesn’t 
exist in the Terms list or a job that belongs to a customer who doesn’t exist in Quick­
Books, it filters the entries in the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window’s table to just 
those with errors and displays the incorrect values in red text. Point your cursor at 
a cell to see a hint about the error. For example, if you typed a letter in a price field, 
QuickBooks tells you that the field contains an invalid character. If the problem is a 
list entry that doesn’t exist, the “[list name] Not Found” dialog box opens (where 
“[list name]” is a list such as Terms) and tells you the value isn’t in the list. In the 
dialog box, click Set Up to add the entry to the list. Fix any other errors, and then 
click Save Changes again.
 TIP 	 If you don’t know what’s causing the error, select the incorrect value and delete it by pressing Delete or 
Backspace. Then, when you figure out what the value should be, you can edit that record in the Add/Edit Multiple 
List Entries window or the corresponding Edit dialog box.
Importing Customer, Vendor, and Item 
Information
If you have hundreds of records to stuff into QuickBooks, even copying and past­
ing can be tedious. But if you can produce a delimited text file or a spreadsheet of 
customer or vendor info in the program where you currently store it (page 691), 
then you can match up your source data with QuickBooks’ fields and import all your 
records in one fell swoop.
Delimited files and spreadsheets compartmentalize data by separating each piece 
of info with a comma or a tab, or by cubbyholing them into columns and rows in 
a spreadsheet file. These files aren’t necessarily ready to import into QuickBooks, 
though. Headings in a delimited file or spreadsheet might identify the field names 
in the program that originally held the information, but QuickBooks has no way of 
knowing the correlation between those fields and its own.
But don’t worry: QuickBooks helps you import your Excel data for customers, ven­
dors, and items. There’s a data-import wizard right in the program. You can use its 
pre-formatted Excel templates to import data from your Excel spreadsheet. (If you 
don’t need any handholding, head to page 691 in Chapter 26 for the full scoop on 
importing data into QuickBooks.)
 TIP 	 Always back up your company file before you import data in case you run into problems. That way, you 
can restore your pre-import file and try again. Page 495 dishes out the details on creating a backup file.

Importing with the Excel Import Wizard Templates
QuickBooks’ Excel import wizard is easy to get to and easy to use. The pre-formatted 
spreadsheets that come with it contain a small subset of the fields associated with 
each list you can import. For example, the customer template includes columns for 
basic contact info and an account number. If the fields you want to import are in the 
wizard’s Excel templates, you can’t beat this wizard for ease of use. (The wizard’s 
Advanced Import button helps you import info from other Excel spreadsheets. The 
next section shows you how to put that button to use.)
 NOTE 	 To use the Excel Import Wizard templates or to import data from your own Excel workbook, you need 
to have Excel installed on your computer.
Here’s how to use the Excel import wizard and its built-in spreadsheets:
1.	 In QuickBooks, choose File→Utilities→Import→Excel Files.
The “Add Your Excel Data to QuickBooks” wizard opens. (If you see the Add/
Edit Multiple List Entries dialog box, click No to proceed to the wizard. If you 
don’t want to see this message again, turn on the “Do not display this message 
in the future” checkbox.)
2.	 Click the button for the type of data you want to import: Customers, Ven­
dors, or Products I Sell.
You see a message warning that you can’t undo the import and recommending 
that you back up your company file first. If you want to create a backup, click No, 
create the backup, and then begin with step 1 again. If you’re ready to import 
data, click Yes to close the message box.
QuickBooks opens an Excel template for the type of data you’re importing, as 
shown in Figure 6-5.
3.	 Copy your data into the template.
Open the Excel spreadsheet whose info you want to get into QuickBooks, select 
the data you want to copy, and then press Ctrl+C. Next, switch to the Excel tem­

Importing Data from Your Own Excel File
You don’t have to use the data-import wizard’s spreadsheets. If your data is already 
sitting in a spreadsheet, the wizard’s Advanced Import button helps you map your 
spreadsheet’s columns to QuickBooks’ fields and then import your data. Here’s 
how it works:
1.	 In QuickBooks, choose File→Utilities→Import→Excel Files. In the “Add 
Your Excel Data to QuickBooks” wizard, click the Advanced Import button.
The “Import a file” dialog box opens.
 TIP 	 What if you don’t have data in an Excel spreadsheet? There’s no need to set up your own file. The 
“QuickBooks Import Excel and CSV toolkit” (http://tinyurl.com/7chnkqn) includes a sample Excel spreadsheet 
with four worksheets. Each worksheet comes with columns that correspond to the fields associated with the 
Customer, Vendor, Item, and Account Lists. Follow the instructions on the web page to download the toolkit to 
your computer.
2.	 In the “Import a file” dialog box, on the “Set up Import” tab, click Browse, 
and then select the Excel file you want to import.
QuickBooks then populates the “Choose a sheet in this Excel workbook” drop-
down list with the names of the worksheets in the workbook you selected.
3.	 Use the “Choose a sheet in this Excel workbook” drop-down list to pick the 
worksheet you want to import.
QuickBooks automatically turns on the “This data file has header rows” check­
box, which is perfect when the first row of the Excel workbook contains text 
labels for the columns.
4.	 In the “Choose a mapping” drop-down list, choose <Add New>.
The Mappings dialog box (Figure 6-6) opens.
5.	 In the “Mapping name” box, type a name for the set of correspondences 
between fields and columns you’re about to create. In the “Import type” 
drop-down list, choose the kind of data you’re importing.
You can choose Customer, Vendor, Item, or Account to import data into any 
of those lists.
6.	 For each QuickBooks field listed in the left column, in the Import Data col­
umn, choose the corresponding Excel header or column name, as shown in 
Figure 6-6.
The QuickBooks column lists every field associated with the list you selected 
in the “Import type” drop-down list. If you don’t want to import data into a 
QuickBooks field, leave the corresponding cell in the Import Data column blank.

turned on in step 3, then the 
drop-down lists that appear

Import Data column show 
the column headings from 
your Excel spreadsheet. 
If your spreadsheet doesn’t 
contain header rows, then 
the drop-down list will 
display entries like Column 
A, Column B, and so on.
7.	 After you’ve mapped all the columns you want to import to QuickBooks 
fields, click Save.
The Mappings dialog box closes and QuickBooks takes you back to the “Import 
a file” dialog box.
8.	 To tell QuickBooks how to handle duplicate records and errors, click the 
“Import a file” dialog box’s Preferences tab, and then choose the settings 
you want.
Out of the box, QuickBooks selects the “Prompt me and let me decide” option 
in the tab’s Duplicate Handling section, which puts you in charge of deciding 
what to do. If the records in your company file are up to date, you can choose 
the “Keep existing data and discard import data” option to keep the records 
in QuickBooks when the same record exists in your company file and the Ex­
cel spreadsheet. Or you can tell the program to replace your existing data in 
QuickBooks with or without blank fields.

Similarly, in the tab’s Error Handling section, QuickBooks selects the option that 
imports all records but leaves fields with errors blank. If you prefer, you can tell 
the program to skip records with errors.
9.	 To review the data you’re about to import, click Preview. In the Preview 
dialog box, in the “In data preview show” drop-down list, choose “only 
errors” to see rows of data that contain errors.
When you select an entry with an error, the “Details for” table shows the values 
you’re trying to import and what the problem is so you can correct it. You can 
also select options to skip importing rows with errors or import records and 
leave error fields blank.
10.	 Click OK to close the Preview dialog box.
Or, if you want to start the import without jumping back to the “Import a file” 
dialog box first, simply click Import in the Preview dialog box and then click 
Yes to complete the import.
11.	 Back in the “Import a file” dialog box, click Import, and then click Yes to 
complete the import.
A message box tells you how many records QuickBooks imported and the 
number of records with errors or warnings. Click OK to close the message box 
and the “Import a file” dialog box.
That’s it! Go ahead and open the list with the data you imported and admire your 
handiwork. (For example, click Customers on the Home Page to open the Customer 
Center.)

CHAPTER

O
pen any QuickBooks window, dialog box, or form, and you’re bound to bump 
into at least one drop-down list. These lists make it easy to fill in transactions 
and forms. Creating an invoice? If you pick the customer and job from the 
Customer:Job drop-down list, QuickBooks fills in the customer’s address, payment 
terms, and other fields for you. Selecting payment terms from the Terms List tells 
the program how to calculate an invoice’s due date. If you choose an entry in the 
Price Level List, QuickBooks calculates the discount or markup you extend to your 
customers for the goods they buy. Even the products and services you sell to cus­
tomers come from the Item List, which you learned about in Chapter 5.
In this chapter, you’ll discover what many of these lists can do for you and learn 
whether it makes sense for you to set them up for your business. Because some 
lists have their own unique fields (such as the Price Level Type for a Price Level 
entry), you’ll also find out what the various fields are for and how to fill them in. If 
you already know which lists and list entries you want, you can skip to page 154 to 
master the techniques that work for most lists, such as adding and tweaking entries, 
hiding entries, and so on. Once you know how to work with one QuickBooks list, the 
doors to almost every other list open, too.

CATEGORIZING 
WITH CLASSES
 NOTE 	 A few lists—such as the Customer, Vendor, and Employee lists—behave a little differently from the ones 
described in this chapter. Here are the other chapters that provide instructions for working with the QuickBooks 
lists that aren’t covered here:
• The chart of accounts, which is a list of your bookkeeping accounts, is explained in Chapter 3.
• The Customer:Job List, which includes entries for both customers and their jobs, is the topic of Chapter 4.
• The Vendor List is also described in Chapter 4.
• The Item List helps you fill in bills, invoices, and other transaction forms with services and products you 
sell; it’s covered in Chapter 5.
• Although the Sales Tax Code List appears on the Lists menu, sales tax codes are inextricably linked to 
how you handle sales tax. The details of setting up this list are described in Chapter 21 on page 550.
• Chapter 12 shows you how to have QuickBooks memorize transactions and store them in the Memorized 
Transaction List so you can reuse them.
• If you turn on QuickBooks’ payroll feature, the Lists menu includes the Payroll Item List, which covers the 
deposits and deductions on your payroll. Payroll items are quite specialized, and you use them only if you use 
one of Intuit’s payroll services. To learn about QuickBooks payroll services and the Payroll Item List, see online 
Appendix D, which you can download from this book’s Missing CD page at www.missing manuals.com/cds.
Categorizing with Classes
Classes are the only solution if you want to classify income and expenses by cat­
egories that span multiple accounts in your chart of accounts; multiple customers, 
jobs, and vendors; or even multiple time periods. Classes help you track financial 
results by categories such as business unit, location, partner, or magazine issue.
Suppose you have business units that all sell to the same customers and rack up the 
same types of expenses, and you want to track the profitability of each unit. Your 
income accounts show sales by products and services, even if each region sells all 
those items. Customer types won’t help if some large customers buy products from 
several regions. The same goes if a job requires a smorgasbord of what you sell. The 
solution? Creating classes that represent business units in QuickBooks’ Class List. 
Classes also come in handy for tracking the allocation of functional expenses that 
nonprofit organizations have to show on financial statements.
When you turn on QuickBooks’ class-tracking feature, every transaction includes 
a Class field. Unlike the Customer Type, Job Type, and Vendor Type fields—which 
you assign when you create a customer, job, or vendor—a transaction’s Class field 
starts out blank. For each invoice, sales receipt, bill, and so on, simply choose the 
class related to the income or expense. That way, you can produce a report broken 
down by class (page 451).

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists

CATEGORIZING 
WITH CLASSES
 TIP 	 Before you decide to use classes, use QuickBooks without them for a few weeks or months. If it turns out 
that you can generate all the reports you need without classes, don’t burden yourself with another field to fill in. 
But if you work without classes and then decide to use them after all, you can go back and edit past transactions 
to assign classes to them, or just start using classes at the beginning of a new fiscal period. For more help deciding 
whether to use classes, see the box below.
UP TO SPEED
Do You Need Classes?
Not every company needs classes, so don’t feel that you have 
to use them. You can call on several other QuickBooks features 
to help keep track of your business. Each tracking feature has 
its advantages, so how do you decide which one(s) to use to 
evaluate your performance? Here’s a brief description of each 
feature and the best use for it:
• Accounts. You can use accounts to segregate income and 
expenses in several ways. For instance, keep income from 
services separate from your product sales by creating two 
different income accounts. Accounts are the fastest way 
to see performance because QuickBooks’ built-in Profit 
& Loss reports (page 448) automatically display results 
by account.
• Customer, job, and vendor types (page 87). To analyze 
income by wholesale, retail, online, and other types of 
customers, classify your customers by type. That way, 
you can filter the reports you generate to show results 
for a specific kind of customer. However, types are more 
limited in scope than accounts—for example, customer 
types apply only to customers. Likewise, job types and 
vendor types help you categorize only by job and vendor, 
respectively.
• Classes. Classes cut across accounts, income, expenses, 
customers, jobs, vendors, and even time, because you 
assign a class to an individual transaction, such as a check, 
bill, or invoice. So classes are perfect for categories that 
span accounts, customers, vendors, and types. Suppose 
the partners in your company help customers implement 
technology and tighten their security. You’ve decided to 
use separate income accounts to track technology sales 
and security sales, and to use customer types to track 
work for the government versus the private sector. You 
also want to track income and expenses by partner, but 
each partner works on all types of service for all types 
of customers. Happily, you can create classes to track 
partners’ sales and expenses, regardless of which service 
they deliver or the type of customer. A “Profit & Loss 
by Class” report (page 451) will then tell you how each 
partner is performing.
Here’s another example of putting classes to work: 
tracking profitability for a monthly publication or event. 
Start by creating classes for each month. Then assign 
income and expense transactions to the class that 
corresponds to the publication month, such as May. That 
way, you can track ad income or printing expenses for 
the May issue, even if the transactions occur in March, 
April, or July.
If you choose to work with classes, be sure to follow these guidelines to get the 
most out of them:
• Pick one use for classes. You can assign just one class to each transaction, 
and QuickBooks has only one list of classes, so every class should represent 
the same type of classification. However, if you want to use classes for two 
different purposes—business units and office branches, say—you can create 
top-level classes for each business unit and subclasses for office branches 
within each top-level class.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
142
CATEGORIZING 
WITH CLASSES
• Use classes consistently. Make sure to use classes on every transaction that 
relates to your classification method. For example, if you classify income and 
expenses by partner, assign a class to every invoice and expense that’s related 
to a partner’s work; otherwise, your class-based reports won’t be accurate. But 
if expenses are overhead and don’t relate to the work partners do, create a class 
for overhead and assign that class to all overhead transactions. That way, you 
can run a report like Profit & Loss Unclassified to look for transactions where 
you forgot to assign a class.
• Create a catchall class. Set up a class like Other so that you can still classify 
transactions even if they don’t fit into any of the specific classes you’ve defined.
Turning on Class Tracking
Before you can start assigning classes, you have to turn on QuickBooks’ class-tracking 
feature. To see whether classes are turned on, in the main QuickBooks menu bar, 
click Lists. If you don’t see a Class List item in the menu, then the class-tracking 
feature is turned off. Here’s how to turn it on:
1.	 Choose Edit→Preferences→Accounting, and then click the Company Pref­
erences tab.
To turn class tracking on, you need to be a QuickBooks administrator, because 
classes affect everyone in your organization who uses the program. (If you 
aren’t a QuickBooks administrator, you’ll have to persuade someone who is to 
turn on classes.)
2.	 Turn on the “Use class tracking for transactions” checkbox.
When you do that, QuickBooks automatically turns on the “Prompt to assign 
classes” checkbox. With this checkbox turned on, if you try to save a transaction 
without an entry in the Class field, QuickBooks gives you a chance to add the 
class (or save the transaction without one). Turn this checkbox off if you don’t 
want to be reminded to assign classes.
3.	 Click OK to close the Preferences window.
The Class List entry now appears on the Lists menu.
Setting Up Classes
Once you’ve turned on class tracking, here’s how you create classes:
1.	 In the main QuickBooks menu bar, choose Lists→Class List.
The Class List window opens.
2.	 In the Class List window, press Ctrl+N or click Class→New.
The New Class window opens.

3.	 In the Class Name box, type a name for the class.
If you want to create a class that’s a subclass of a parent (to set up subclasses 
for each region within a business unit, say), turn on the “Subclass of” checkbox. 
Then, in the drop-down list, choose the parent class you want. (Obviously, you 
can create subclasses only once you’ve created at least one regular class.)
4.	 Click Next to create another class, or click OK to close the New Class window.
If you realize you need another class while you’re working on a transaction, you 
can create an entry by choosing <Add New> in the Class drop-down list shown in 
Figure 7-1.
FIGURE 7-1
After you turn on class tracking, every 
transaction you create includes a 
Class field. 
To assign a class to a transaction, 
choose one of the classes from the 
drop-down list or choose <Add New>.
Price Levels
Whether you give your favorite customers price breaks or increase other customers’ 
charges because they keep asking for “just one more thing,” you can apply discounts 
and markups when you create invoices. But remembering who gets discounts and 
how big is tough when you have a lot of customers, and it’s bad form to mark up a 
favorite customer’s prices by mistake.
Say hello to QuickBooks’ Price Level List. When you define price levels and assign 
them to customers, QuickBooks takes care of adjusting the prices on every invoice 
you create. You can also apply a price level to specific lines on invoices to mark up 
or discount individual items. For example, suppose you create a price level that rep­
resents a 15 percent discount. If you apply that price level to a customer, the sales 
forms you create for that customer automatically discount prices by 15 percent. And 
if you apply that price level to a product on a customer’s invoice, the product’s price 
gets reduced by 15 percent.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

PRICE LEVELS
Creating a Price Level
To create a price level, do the following:
1.	 Make sure the Price Level preference is turned on (you have to be a Quick­
Books administrator to turn it on).
If QuickBooks’ Price Level preference is turned off, you won’t see the Price 
Level List item in the Lists menu. In that case, choose Edit→Preferences→Sales 
& Customers, and then click the Company Preferences tab. Select the Enable 
Price Levels radio button, and then click OK.
2.	 Choose Lists→Price Level List.
The Price Level List window opens.
3.	 In the Price Level List window, press Ctrl+N or click Price Level→New.
The New Price Level window, shown in Figure 7-2 (foreground), opens.
4.	 In the Price Level Name box, type a name for the level.
If you have a fixed set of discounts, you might name the various levels by the 
percentage, like Discount 10 and Discount 20, for example. An alternative is to 
name them by their purpose, like Customer Loyalty or User Group Discount. 
That way, it’s easy to change the discount amount without changing the price 
level’s name.
5.	 In the “This price level will” box, choose “increase” or “decrease” depend­
ing on whether you want the price level to mark up or discount items, and 
then enter the percentage in the “item prices by” box.
In QuickBooks Pro, the Price Level Type box is automatically set to “Fixed %” 
because you can create price levels that increase or decrease prices only by a 
fixed percentage, as described in Figure 7-2. See the box on page 145 to learn 
about the Per Item price level available in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise.
6.	 For percentage price levels, in the “Round up to nearest” drop-down list, 
choose the type of rounding you want to apply.
The “Round up to nearest” setting is handy if the percentages you apply result 
in fractions of pennies or amounts too small to bother with. It lets you round 
discounts to pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollars, and even whole 
dollars (if you really hate making change). The box on page 146 explains other, 
fancier kinds of rounding you can apply.
7.	 Click OK to close the New Price Level window.
To create another price level, repeat steps 3–7.
 NOTE 	 You can’t create price levels on the fly while you’re creating an invoice. The easiest solution to a 
missing price level is to adjust the price on the invoice manually. Then, after the invoice is done, add the price 
level to your Price Level List.

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists
145
PRICE LEVELS
FIGURE 7-2
Think of fixed-percentage price levels as standard 
discounts or markups. For example, you can create a 
price level called Most Valued Customer to discount 
prices by 25 percent. Then assign that price level in 
the customer record (page 77) of every big spender 
you work with. 
(Although price levels’ names don’t appear on your 
customer invoices, it’s still a good idea to choose 
names that are meaningful without being rude.)
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Per-Item Price Levels
In QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise, you can create price 
levels that apply to individual items in your Item List. To do 
that, in the New Price Level window’s Price Level Type drop-
down list, choose Per Item. The window then displays a table 
containing all the items in your Item List.
In the Custom Price column, type the price for an item at that 
price level. For example, suppose you sell calendars to retail 
stores for $5 each. The Standard Price column would show 
5.00 for the calendar item. If you’re creating a price level for 
nonprofit organizations, you could type 3.50 in the item’s 
Custom Price cell so that a nonprofit would pay only $3.50 
for a calendar.
If you want to apply percentages to several items in the table 
displayed in the New Price Level window, there’s a shortcut for 
calculating custom prices:
1.	 Turn on the checkboxes for all the items that use the same 
percentage increase or decrease.
2.	 In the “Adjust price of marked items to be” box, type 
the percentage. In the drop-down list next to it, choose 
“lower” or “higher.” And in the “than its” drop-down 
list, choose an entry to tell QuickBooks to calculate the 
price level based on the standard price, the cost, or the 
current custom price.
3.	 Click the Adjust button, and QuickBooks fills in the 
Custom Price cells for the marked items with the new, 
custom prices.
4.	 To apply different percentages to another set of items, 
clear any checkmarks and then repeat steps 1–3.
If you work with more than one currency and turn on the 
multiple currency preference (page 656), you can create price 
levels for individual items to set their prices in different cur-
rencies. Here’s how: In the New Price Level window, choose the 
currency in the Currency drop-down list. Then, in the Custom 
Price cell, type the price for the item in the foreign currency. 
After that, when you add the item to a sales form, simply 
choose the currency price level in that form’s Rate drop-down 
list, and QuickBooks recalculates the price.

Applying Price Levels
You can apply price levels in two ways:
• Applying a price level to a customer record (page 77) tells QuickBooks to 
automatically adjust all the prices on every new invoice for that customer by 
that price level’s percentage (page 235).
• Applying a price level to line items on an invoice adjusts the prices of those 
items whether or not a customer has a standard price level. To do so, in the 
Create Invoices window, click an item’s Rate cell, and then choose the price level 
you want from the drop-down list.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Rounding Price Level Values
When you use percentages to calculate markups and discounts, 
the resulting values may not be what you want. The basic 
choices in the New Price Level window’s “Round up to nearest” 
drop-down list take care of the most common rounding—to 
the nearest penny, dime, quarter, dollar, and so on. But other 
entries on the list let you give QuickBooks more complex 
rounding instructions.
The seven entries that include the word “minus” help you posi-
tion prices at magic marketing points like $29.99 or $1.95. For 
example, the “.10 minus .01” entry ensures that the price always 
ends in 9. With this setting, if the discounted price comes out to 
$8.74, QuickBooks rounds up to the nearest 10 cents ($8.80) and 
then subtracts 1 cent, so the rounded value is $8.79.
If you like to undercut your competitors with unusual price 
points, in the “Round up to nearest” drop-down menu, choose 
“user defined.” QuickBooks then displays several boxes and 
options for defining your own rounding:
• The “nearest” drop-down menu. In the unlabeled 
drop-down menu below “user defined,” you can choose 
“to nearest,” “up to nearest,” or “down to nearest.” “To 
nearest” rounds in whichever direction is closest (for 
example, rounding from 1.73 to 1.70 or from 1.77 to 1.80).
• The first $ box. Type the value you want to round to, like 
.01, .25, or 1.00.
• Plus or Minus and the second $ box. Select the Plus or 
Minus radio button depending on whether you want to 
add or subtract money after you’ve rounded the value. 
Then, in the second $ box, type the amount you want to 
add or subtract from the rounded value. (If you don’t want 
to use this feature, just leave the second $ box set to 0.)
Customer and Vendor Profile Lists
Filling in fields goes much faster when you can choose info from drop-down lists 
instead of typing values. The lists that appear on the Customer & Vendor Profile 
Lists submenu (to see it, choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists) pop up 
regularly, whether you’re creating an invoice, paying a bill, or generating a report. 
For example, when you create an invoice, QuickBooks fills in the Payment Terms field 
with the terms you assigned to the customer’s record (page 76), but you can choose 
different terms from the drop-down list to urge your customer to pay more quickly.

For many of these lists, creating entries involves nothing more than typing the en­
try’s name and specifying whether that entry is a subentry of another. This section 
describes how to add entries to each list and how to put these lists to work for you.
Sales Rep List
The Sales Rep List is perfect when you want to assign people as points of contact 
for your customers. The people you add to this list can be sales reps you pay on 
commission or employees who are dedicated contacts for customers. For example, 
if you assign people as sales reps to your customers (page 77) and add the appro­
priate rep to your sales transactions, you can then generate reports by sales rep 
(page 597). But first you have to add the names of your sales reps and contacts to 
the Sales Rep List.
 NOTE 	 If you’d like an add-on program to help you calculate commissions, go to http://workplace.intuit.
com/appcenter. In the “Search for apps” box, type sales commission, and then press Enter.
To add a name to the Sales Rep List:
1.	 Choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Sales Rep List; in the Sales 
Rep List window that opens, press Ctrl+N or click Sales Rep→New.
The New Sales Rep window opens.
2.	 In the Sales Rep Name drop-down list, choose a name; in the Sales Rep 
Initials box, type the person’s initials.
The Sales Rep Name list displays names from the Employee List, the Vendor 
List, and the Other Names List (page 148). QuickBooks automatically fills in 
the Sales Rep Type field with Employee, Vendor, or Other Name, depending 
on which list the name came from or, if you just added the name, the type you 
assigned when you added that person. (The box on page 148 gives hints about 
when to use the Other Names List.)
If the name you want doesn’t exist, choose <Add New> at the top of the list. 
In the Select Name Type dialog box that appears, select Vendor, Employee, or 
Other, and then click OK. Then, in the New Name window that opens, fill in the 
Name box and any other fields you want.
3.	 Click Next to add another sales rep, or click OK to close the New Sales Rep 
window.
If you select a name and realize that it’s misspelled, you can edit it right from 
the New Sales Rep window: Click Edit Name, and QuickBooks opens the Edit 
Employee, Edit Vendor, or Edit Name dialog box so you can change the name.

When to Use the Other Names List
If you have more than a few names on your Other Names List, 
you’re probably not getting the most out of QuickBooks. In 
fact, unless you’re a sole proprietor or several partners share 
ownership of your company, you can run QuickBooks without 
any names on the Other Names List.
The entries in the Other Names List show up in the drop-down 
menus for a few types of transactions, such as checks and credit 
card charges (page 202). But they don’t appear for other types of 
transactions, like invoices, purchase orders, and sales receipts.
So what are Other Names good for? People who aren’t custom-
ers, vendors, or employees—for example, your name as sole 
proprietor or the names of company partners. That way, when 
you write partners’ distribution checks, you can choose their 
names from the Other Names List.
To create an entry on the Other Names List:
1.	 Choose Lists→Other Names List.
2.	 When the Other Names List window opens, press Ctrl+N.
3.	 Fill in the fields in the New Name dialog box, which 
are similar to the ones in the New Customer dialog box 
(page 70).
4.	 Click OK. 
The Other Names List can also serve as a holding tank. If you 
aren’t sure which list to put someone on, you can temporarily 
add that person to the Other Names List. Then, when you figure 
out which list she should be on, you can move her. Because 
QuickBooks needs to close all open windows to move people 
between lists, it’s best to save this task for a lull in your work-
day. When you’re ready, open the Other Names List window 
and click Activities→Change Other Name Types. In the Change 
Name Types dialog box that appears, find the person’s name, 
and then click the cell in the appropriate column (Customer, 
Vendor, or Employee) to assign that type. Click OK to complete 
the makeover.
If you realize that you created two entries for the same person 
in the Other Names List, you can merge one into the other. 
Merging entries in the Other Names List is similar to merging 
customers (page 92). The alternative is to make one of the 
two entries inactive, as described on page 90, and then use 
the other entry for all future transactions.
Customer Type List
Customer types help you analyze your income and expenses by customer category 
(page 87). For example, a healthcare provider might create Government and Private 
customer types to see how much a change in government reimbursement might 
hurt revenue.
You first create customer types in the Customer Type List and then assign one of 
those types in each customer’s record. Creating all your customer types up front is 
fast—as long as you already know what entries you want to create:
1.	 Choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Customer Type List; when 
the Customer Type List window opens, press Ctrl+N.
The New Customer Type window opens (Figure 7-3).

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists

CUSTOMER 
AND VENDOR 
PROFILE LISTS
FIGURE 7-3
The only thing you have to fill in here is the Customer Type field. 
If this type represents a portion of a larger customer category, 
turn on the “Subtype of” checkbox, and then choose the parent 
type. For example, if you have a Government customer type, you 
might create subtypes like Federal, State, County, and so on.
2.	 Enter a name in the Customer Type field.
If the new type is a subtype of another, turn on the “Subtype of” checkbox, and 
then choose the parent type from the drop-down list.
3.	 Click OK if you’re done, or click Next to create another type.
You can also create entries as you work: If you’re creating or modifying a customer 
in the New Customer or Edit Customer window, click the Additional Info tab. In the 
Customer Type drop-down list, choose <Add New> to open the New Customer Type 
window so you can create a new customer type, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Vendor Type List
Vendor types work similarly to customer types—you can filter reports or subtotal 
expenses by different types of vendors. For example, if you create a Contractor 
vendor type, you could generate a report showing how much you spend on sub­
contractors you hire.
You create Vendor Type entries the way you create Customer Type entries: Choose 
Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Vendor Type List, and then press Ctrl+N 
to open the New Vendor Type window.
 TIP 	 To create a new vendor type while you’re creating a vendor, in the New Vendor dialog box, click the 
Additional Info tab and then, in the Vendor Type drop-down list, choose <Add New> to open the New Vendor 
Type window.
Job Type List
Job types also follow the customer-type lead. You can use job types to classify the 
projects you perform for customers, as described on page 87. For instance, you 
can filter a Profit & Loss report to show how profitable your spec-house projects 
are compared with your remodeling contracts. You create Job Type entries the 
way you create Customer Type entries: Open the Job Type List window by choos­
ing Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Job Type List, and then press Ctrl+N.

Terms List
The Terms List includes both the payment terms you require of your customers and 
the payment terms your vendors ask of you. If you assign terms in a customer’s record, 
then QuickBooks automatically fills in the Terms box on the invoices you create for 
that customer. Likewise, filling in terms in a vendor record means that QuickBooks 
fills in the Terms box on bills you enter.
To add a new term, open the Terms List window (Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile 
Lists→Terms List), and then press Ctrl+N. The fields that you fill in to create terms 
(Figure 7-4) are different from those in other Customer & Vendor Profile lists. The fol­
lowing sections explain the New Terms window’s Standard and Date Driven options.
FIGURE 7-4
Because payment terms apply to both vendors and custom-
ers, consider using generic names that say something about 
the terms themselves. 
For example, the “10% 5 Net 30” entry shown here is an 
enticement for early payments because it means that the 
amount is due 30 days from the invoice date, but you can 
deduct 10 percent from your bill if you pay within 5 days.
SETTING UP TERMS USING ELAPSED TIME
The New Terms window’s Standard option is ideal when the payment due date is a 
specific number of days after the invoice date (or the date you receive a bill from a 
vendor). If you send invoices whenever you complete a sale, choose the Standard 
option.
Here’s what the Standard option’s fields do:
• Net due in _ days. Type the maximum number of days after the bill or invoice 
date that you or a customer can pay. For example, if you type 30, customers 
have up to 30 days to pay an invoice or you have up to 30 days to pay a bill. 
If you charge penalties for late payments, QuickBooks uses the value in this 
field to figure out when customer payments are late so you can assess finance 
charges (page 359).
• Discount percentage is. If you or your vendor offer a discount for early pay­
ments, type the discount percentage in this box.

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists
151
CUSTOMER 
AND VENDOR 
PROFILE LISTS
• Discount if paid within _ days. Type the number of days after the bill or invoice 
date within which you or a customer has to pay to receive the early payment 
discount.
 NOTE 	 When your terms reduce a customer’s bill for early payments, QuickBooks deducts these discounts 
in the Receive Payments window (page 352), where the program can determine whether the customer paid 
early. If a vendor offers discounts for early payments, you can take advantage of those in the Pay Bills window 
(page 195).
SETTING UP DATE-DRIVEN TERMS
The Date Driven option sets up terms for payments that are due on a specific date, 
regardless of the date on the invoice. This option is handy if you or your vendors 
send invoices on a schedule—say, on the last day of the month. For example, home 
mortgages often assess a late fee if payments arrive after the 15th of the month.
Here’s what the New Terms window’s Date Driven options do:
• Net due before the _ th day of the month. Type the day that the payment is 
due. For example, if a payment is due before the 15th of the month, no matter 
what date appears on your statement, type 15 in this box.
• Due the next month if issued within _ days of due date. Your customers might 
get annoyed if you require payment by the 15th of the month and send out your 
invoices on the 14th. They would have no way of paying on time—unless they 
camped out in your billing department.
You can type a number of days in this box to automatically push the due date to 
the following month when you issue invoices too close to the due date. Suppose 
payments are due on the 15th of each month and you type 5 in this box. In that 
case, for invoices you create between August 10 and August 15, QuickBooks 
automatically changes the due date to September 15.
• Discount percentage is. If you or your vendors extend a discount for early 
payments, type the discount percentage in this box.
• Discount if paid before the _ th day of the month. Type the day of the month 
before which you or a customer has to pay to receive the early payment discount.
Customer Message List
When you create an invoice, you can add a short message to it, such as “If you like 
the service we deliver, tell your friends. If you don’t like our service, tell us.” To save 
time and prevent embarrassing typos, add your stock messages to the Customer 
Message List (Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists→Customer Message List).
In the Customer Message List window, press Ctrl+N to open the New Customer 
Message dialog box. This dialog box has only one field—Message—which can hold 
up to 101 characters (including spaces).

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
152
CUSTOMER 
AND VENDOR 
PROFILE LISTS
 TIP 	 Don’t use the Customer Message List for notes that change with every invoice (like one that specifies 
the date range that an invoice covers) because you’ll fill the list with unique messages and won’t be able to add 
any more. If you want to include unique information, do so in the cover letter (or email) that accompanies your 
invoice.
Payment Method List
Categorizing payments by the method the customer uses can be handy. For instance, 
when you select Banking→Make Deposits (page 368), you can choose to process all 
the payments you’ve received via a specific payment method—deposit all the checks 
and cash you received into your checking account, say, but deposit the payments 
you receive via credit cards to a dedicated merchant account.
You categorize payments by using the entries on the Payment Method List. Quick­
Books starts the list for you with entries for cash, check, credit cards (such as 
American Express and Visa), and electronic payments. To add another payment 
method—for payments through PayPal, for example—choose Lists→Customer & 
Vendor Profile Lists→Payment Method List, and then press Ctrl+N. In the New Pay­
ment Method dialog box, type a name for the method, and then choose a type. For 
PayPal, choose Other in the Payment Type drop-down list. The list of types also 
includes options like Debit Card, Gift Card, and E-Check.
Ship Via List
When your invoices include the shipping method that you use, your customers know 
whether to watch for the mailman or the UPS truck. QuickBooks creates several ship­
ping methods for you: DHL, Federal Express, UPS, and US Mail. If you use another 
method, like a bike messenger in New York City or your own delivery truck, simply 
create additional entries in the Ship Via List window (Lists→Customer & Vendor 
Profile Lists→Ship Via List) by pressing Ctrl+N. In the Shipping Method field (the 
only field in the New Ship Method dialog box), type a name for the method, and 
then click OK.
 TIP 	 If you use one shipping method most of the time, you can have QuickBooks fill in the Shipping Method 
field on invoices with that entry automatically. See page 663 to learn about the Usual Shipping Method preference 
and the Usual Free on Board location.
Vehicle List
If you want to track mileage (page 175) on the vehicles you use for your business, 
create entries for your cars and trucks in the Vehicle List (Lists→Customer & Vendor 
Profile Lists→Vehicle List). Press Ctrl+N and then use the Vehicle box to name the 
vehicle: Ford Prefect 1982 Red, for example. The Description field holds up to 256 
characters, so you can use it to store the VIN, license plate, and even the insurance 
policy number.

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists

FIXED ASSET 
ITEMS
 TIP 	 If you want to charge your customers for mileage, see page 178.
Fixed Asset Items
Assets that you can’t convert to cash quickly—such as backhoes, buildings, and 
supercomputers—are called fixed assets. If you track information about your fixed 
assets in another program or have only a few fixed assets, there’s no reason to bother 
with QuickBooks’ Fixed Asset Item List. As you can see in Figure 7-5 QuickBooks 
can track info such as when you bought the item and how much you paid. But in 
QuickBooks Pro, you have to calculate depreciation (see the box on page 435) for 
each asset at the end of the year and create journal entries to adjust the values in 
your asset accounts.
FIGURE 7-5
When you buy a fixed as-
set, you can create a Fixed 
Asset item and enter the 
asset’s name and purchase 
info, where you keep it, its 
serial number, and when 
the warranty expires. 
When you create a Fixed 
Asset item, QuickBooks 
doesn’t automatically add 
the purchase price to the 
asset account you choose 
here. Instead, the account 
you choose in your pur-
chase transaction (check 
or credit card charge, for 
instance) is what adds the 
purchase price to the Fixed 
Asset account in your chart 
of accounts.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks Premier Accountant edition and QuickBooks Enterprise edition include the Fixed Asset 
Manager, which figures out the depreciation on your assets and posts depreciation to an account in your Quick­
Books company file. If you have an accountant prepare your depreciation schedule, then go with the number 
your accountant gives you. The depreciation that QuickBooks calculates may be close to, but different from, the 
number your accountant calculates.

MANAGING 
LISTS
When you sell an asset, open the Edit Item dialog box (choose Lists→Fixed Asset Item 
List, select the asset you sold, and then press Ctrl+E) and turn on the “Item is sold” 
checkbox. When you do that, the sales fields come to life so you can specify when 
you sold the asset, how much you got for it, and any costs associated with the sale.
If you decide to track the details about your fixed assets outside QuickBooks, you 
still need to include the value of those assets in your financial reports. Simply create 
Fixed Asset accounts for each fixed asset (page 57) to hold those values. Then, 
each year, add a journal entry to record the amount of depreciation for your fixed 
assets (page 433).
Managing Lists
Every list in QuickBooks responds to the same set of commands. As your business 
changes, you can add new entries, edit existing ones, hide entries that you no longer 
use, and (in some lists) merge two entries into one. If you make a mistake creating 
an entry, you can delete it. You can also print your QuickBooks lists to produce a 
price list of the products you sell, for example. Using the following techniques, you’ll 
be able to do what you want with any list or entry you might need.
Creating Entries
If you’re setting up QuickBooks, creating all the entries for a list at the same time 
is fast and efficient. Open the New dialog box for the type of list entry you want 
(New Customer Type, for example), and you’ll soon get into a rhythm creating one 
entry after another.
You can also add new list entries in the middle of bookkeeping tasks without too 
much of an interruption. (If you launch a new line of business selling moose repel­
lent, for example, you can add a Burly Men customer type in the middle of creating 
an invoice.) But don’t rely on this approach to add every entry to every list—you’ll 
spend so much time jumping from dialog box to dialog box that you’ll never get to 
your bookkeeping.
Each list has its own collection of fields, but the overall process for creating list 
entries is the same:
1.	 To open the window for the list you want to work on, on the main QuickBooks 
menu bar, click Lists, and then select the list you want on the submenu.
For example, to open the Class List window, choose Lists→Class List.
Several lists are tucked away one level deeper on the Lists menu. For lists that 
include characteristics of your customers or vendors, such as Vendor Type or 
Terms, choose Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile Lists, and then choose the list 
you want, as shown in Figure 7-6.

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists
155
MANAGING 
LISTS
FIGURE 7-6
To boost your productivity, 
take note of the keyboard 
shortcuts for lists you’re 
likely to access most often. 
For example, Ctrl+A opens 
the Chart of Accounts 
window. (Online Appendix 
C lists lots of other handy 
keyboard shortcuts.) 
In addition, when you see 
an underlined letter in a 
menu entry, you can type 
that letter to launch that 
feature. For example, when 
the Lists menu is open, 
press C to open the Class List 
window.
2.	 To create a new entry, press Ctrl+N; right-click the list window and choose 
New on the shortcut menu that appears; or, at the bottom of the window, 
click the button with the list’s name on it, and then choose New.
For instance, to create an entry in the Class List, make sure that the Class List 
window is active, and then press Ctrl+N. Or, at the bottom of the window, click 
Class→New. Either way, QuickBooks opens the New Class window.
3.	 After you’ve completed one entry, simply click Next to save the current 
entry and begin another. To save the entry you just created and close the 
dialog box, click OK.
To toss an entry that you botched, click Cancel to throw it away and close the 
dialog box.
 NOTE 	 Unlike all the other New windows for lists, the New Price Level window doesn’t include a Next button.
Editing Entries
To modify a list entry, open the window for that list. Then select the entry you want 
to edit and press Ctrl+E or double-click the entry. (You can customize the columns 
that appear in list windows so it’s easier to see values associated with list entries;

the box below tells you how.) When the Edit dialog box opens, make the changes 
you want, and then click OK.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Customizing Columns in List Windows
Some list entries don’t come with many fields, such as the items 
in the Ship Via List, so all you need to see in that list window is 
the names of the shipping methods you’ve created. But other 
lists, such as Terms, store a plethora of information, including 
discounts and days of the month associated with the terms. 
Fortunately, you can customize the columns that appear in list 
windows so you can see list entries’ values without editing the 
entries. Here’s how:
1.	 At the bottom of the list window, click the button with 
the list’s name on it, and then choose Customize Columns.
2.	 In the “Customize Columns - [list name]” dialog box that 
appears, in the Available Columns list, select a field you 
want to display, and then click Add. The column moves 
to the Chosen Columns list.
3.	 Repeat step 2 to add more columns.
4.	 To remove a column from the window, in the Chosen 
Columns list, select the field, and then click Remove.
5.	 To move a field to another position, select it in the Chosen 
Columns list, and then click Move Up or Move Down until 
it’s in the position you want.
6.	 When you’re done customizing, click OK. The fields you 
selected appear in the window, as shown in Figure 7-7 
(background).
FIGURE 7-7
You can add, remove, and 
reorder the fields in the 
Customize Columns dialog 
box. 
The fields are listed from 
top to bottom in the Cho-
sen Columns list, but they 
appear from left to right in 
the list window.
Hiding Entries
Deleting entries is only for discarding entries that you create by mistake. If you’ve 
already used list entries in transactions, hide the entries you don’t use anymore so 
your historical records are complete. For example, you wouldn’t delete the “Net 30” 

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists
157
MANAGING 
LISTS
payment term just because you’re lucky enough to have only Net 15 clients right 
now; you may still extend Net 30 terms to some clients in the future.
Hiding list entries that you no longer use does two things:
• Keeps your records intact. Your previous transactions still use the entries 
you’ve hidden, so your historical records don’t change.
• Declutters your lists. When you create new transactions, the hidden entries 
don’t appear in drop-down lists, so you can’t choose them by mistake.
The methods for hiding and reactivating list entries are exactly the same regardless 
of which list you’re working on:
• To hide an entry: In the list’s window, right-click the entry and choose “Make 
[list name] Inactive” from the shortcut menu, where [list name] is the list you’re 
editing, such as Class or Sales Rep. The entry disappears from the list.
• To view all the entries in a list: At the bottom of the list window, turn on the 
“Include inactive” checkbox so you can see both active and hidden entries. 
QuickBooks adds a column with an X as its heading and displays an X in that 
column for every inactive entry in the list. (If no entries are inactive, the “Include 
inactive” checkbox is grayed out.)
• To reactivate an entry: First, display all the entries as described above, and then 
click the X next to the entry you want to reactivate. If the entry has subentries, 
then in the Activate Group dialog box that appears, click Yes to reactivate the 
entry and all its subentries.
Deleting Entries
You can delete a list entry only if nothing in your QuickBooks company file refer­
ences it in any way. To delete a list entry, open the appropriate list window, select 
the entry you want to delete, and then press Ctrl+D or, in the main QuickBooks 
menu bar, choose Edit→“Delete [list name].” As long as the entry isn’t used in any 
records or transactions, QuickBooks asks you to confirm that you want to delete 
the entry; click Yes. 
If you realize immediately that you didn’t want to delete the entry, press Ctrl+Z to 
undo the delete. But if you’ve already performed any other action in QuickBooks, 
you can’t undo the deletion. The only way to get the list entry back is to recreate it.
Finding List Entries in Transactions
If QuickBooks won’t let you delete a list entry because a transaction is still using it, 
don’t worry—it’s easy to find transactions that use a specific list entry. Here’s how:
1.	 Open the list that contains the entry you want to find and, in the list window, 
right-click the entry and choose Find on the shortcut menu.
The Find dialog box opens already set up to search for transactions that use 
the list entry you selected.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
158
MANAGING 
LISTS
2.	 Click Find.
The table at the bottom of the Find dialog box displays all the transactions that 
use that entry.
3.	 To modify the list entry a transaction uses, select the transaction in the 
table, and then click Go To.
QuickBooks opens the window or dialog box that corresponds to the type of 
transaction. If you’re trying to eliminate references to a list entry so you can 
delete it, choose a different list entry, and then save the transaction.
Sorting Lists
QuickBooks sorts lists alphabetically by name, which is usually what you want. The 
only reason to sort a list another way is if you’re having trouble finding the entry you 
want to edit. For example, if you want to find equipment you bought within the last 
few years, you could sort the Fixed Asset List by purchase date to find the machines 
that you’re still depreciating. Figure 7-8 shows you how to change the sort order.
 NOTE 	 Sorting in a list window doesn’t change the order in which entries appear in drop-down lists, unless 
you manually sort a list by dragging the diamond icons to the left of list items’ names.
FIGURE 7-8
To sort a list by a column, click 
the column’s heading, such as 
Purchase Date. The first time you 
click the heading, QuickBooks sorts 
the list in ascending order, and the 
small black triangle in the heading 
(circled) points up, as shown here. 
To toggle between ascending and 
descending order, click the heading 
again, and the triangle points down.
 NOTE 	 As mentioned above, QuickBooks initially sorts lists by their Name columns. If you sort a list by a 
different column, you see a gray diamond to the left of the column heading that it used to sort the list initially. For 
example, if you sort the Fixed Asset Item List by Purchase Date, a gray diamond appears to the left of the Name 
heading, as shown in Figure 7-8. To return the list to the order that QuickBooks originally used, click this diamond.
Printing Lists
After you spend all that time building lists in QuickBooks, you’ll be happy to know 
that it’s much easier to get information about those lists out of the program than 
it was to put it in. For instance, suppose you want to print a price list of all your 

Chapter 7: Setting Up Other QuickBooks Lists
159
MANAGING 
LISTS
inventory items. QuickBooks makes short work of printing lists or turning them into 
files that you can use in other programs.
BLASTING OUT A QUICK LIST
Here’s the fastest way to produce a list, albeit one that doesn’t give you any control 
over the report’s appearance:
1.	 At the bottom left of a list window, click the button labeled with the list’s 
name—like Price Level, for example—and then, in the drop-down menu, 
choose Print List (or press Ctrl+P).
QuickBooks might display a message box telling you to try list reports if you 
want to customize or format your reports; that method is covered in the next 
section. For now, in the message box, click OK. The Print Lists dialog box opens.
 NOTE 	 To print Customer, Vendor, or Employee lists, in the Customer Center, Vendor Center, or Employee 
Center toolbar, click Print. On the Print submenu, choose an entry, such as Customer & Job List, to print a list of 
customers and jobs with their open balances. Choosing Print→Customer & Job Information prints information 
about the selected customer or job. And Choosing Print→Customer & Job Transaction List prints a report of the 
selected customer’s or job’s transactions.
2.	 To print the list, select the Printer option, and then choose a printer in the 
drop-down list. To output the list to a file, choose the File option instead, 
and then select the format you want.
If you go with the Printer option, you can specify print settings, as you can in 
many other programs. Choose landscape or portrait orientation, the pages to 
print, and the number of copies.
If you choose File, you can create ASCII text files, comma-delimited files, or 
tab-delimited files (page 685).
3.	 Click Print.
QuickBooks prints the report or creates the type of file you selected.
CUSTOMIZING A PRINTED LIST
If the Print List feature described above scatters fields over the page or produces a 
comma-delimited file that doesn’t play well with your email program, you’ll be happy 
to know that QuickBooks might offer a report closer to what you have in mind. For 
example, an Item Price List is only two clicks away.
To access the reports that come with QuickBooks, in the program’s main menu bar, 
go to Reports→List, and then choose the report you want. If these reports fall short, 
you can modify them to change the fields and records they include, and format 
them in a variety of ways. Chapter 23 has the whole story on customizing reports.

hen customers pay for your services, they’re really buying your knowl­
edge of how to get the job done the best and fastest possible way. That’s 
why an inexperienced carpenter charges $15 an hour, whereas a master 
woodworker who hammers faster and straighter than a nail gun charges $80 an 
hour. When it comes right down to it, time is money, so you want to keep track of 
both with equal accuracy. Product-based companies track time, too. For example, 
companies that want to increase productivity often start by tracking the time that 
employees work and what they work on.
There are hordes of off-the-shelf and homegrown time-tracking programs out 
there, but if your time-tracking needs are fairly simple, you can record time directly 
in QuickBooks or use its companion program, QuickBooks Pro Timer, which you 
can provide to each person whose work hours you want to track. The advantage 
of tracking time in QuickBooks is that the hours you record are ready to attach to 
an invoice (see page 253) or use in payroll (see online Appendix D). In this chapter, 
you’ll learn how to record time in QuickBooks itself. Appendix F (available from this 
book’s Missing CD page at www.missingmanuals.com/cds) explains the ins and outs 
of the standalone Timer program.
 NOTE 	 If your time-tracking needs outpace QuickBooks’ time-tracking features, Intuit’s marketplace (http://
marketplace.intuit.com) lists about 50 time-tracking solutions that integrate with QuickBooks. Click Search By 
Business Need, and then click Time Tracking. You can then specify features you’re looking for by turning on the 
checkboxes that appear, such as online access or the ability to track time against projects. Intuit’s App Center 
(http://appcenter.intuit.com) also lists a few time-tracking solutions. Type time tracking in the Search box, and then 
click the Search button (it looks like a magnifying glass). To search further afield, type keywords like QuickBooks 
time tracking into your favorite Internet search engine.

SETTING UP 
TIME TRACKING
Mileage is another commodity that many companies track—or should. Whether 
your business hinges on driving or merely requires the occasional jaunt, the IRS lets 
you deduct vehicle mileage, as long as you can document the miles you deduct. 
And you might charge customers for the miles driven in conjunction with the work 
you do for them. As you’ll learn in this chapter, QuickBooks can help you track the 
mileage of company vehicles; you can then use that info for tax deductions or to

For many businesses, approximations of time worked are fine. For example, employ­
ees who work on only one or two tasks each day can review the past week and log 
their hours in a weekly timesheet. But for people with deliciously high hourly rates, 
you want to capture every minute spent on an activity.
QuickBooks can help you track time whether you take a conscientious approach 
or a more cavalier one. You can choose from two different ways of recording time 
within QuickBooks:
• Enter time data in QuickBooks. You can enter time for individual activities or 
fill in a weekly timesheet. In the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box, you can 
type in the number of hours for a single activity. The dialog box also includes 
a stopwatch, so you can have it track the time you spend working on a task.
• Use QuickBooks Pro Timer’s stopwatch. This program, which comes on the 
QuickBooks CD, lets you time activities as you work so you can track your time 
to the second—as long as you remember to start and stop the Timer at the right 
moments. (If you forget to turn the Timer on or off, you can edit time entries to 
correct them.) The best thing about Timer is that you can use it to record time 
even when QuickBooks isn’t running. Moreover, you can give a copy of Timer 
to all your employees and subcontractors so they can send you time data to 
import into QuickBooks.
 NOTE 	 If you download QuickBooks and want the Timer program, head online to http://support.quickbooks.
intuit.com/support/Articles/HOW13261 to learn how to get it without a DVD.
No matter which technique you use to capture time, the setup is the same: You tell 
QuickBooks that you want to track time and then set up the people who need to 
track their time (employees and outside contractors alike). You use the customers 
and items you’ve set up in QuickBooks to identify the billable time you work. If you 
want to track nonbillable time, you need a few more entries in QuickBooks, which 
you’ll learn about in the following sections.

SETTING UP 
TIME TRACKING
Turning on Time Tracking
If you told QuickBooks that you want to track time when you created your company 
file (page 17), the time-tracking preferences and features should be ready to go. To 
see whether time tracking is turned on, choose Edit→Preferences→Time & Expenses 
(you may have to scroll down to see this category), and then click the Company 
Preferences tab shown in Figure 8-1 (only a QuickBooks administrator can turn time 
tracking on or off). If the Yes radio button below “Do you track time?” isn’t selected, 
click it. (If your company file is in multi-user mode, QuickBooks tells you that you 
have to switch to single-user mode [page 489] first.)
FIGURE 8-1
If most of your work time 
is billable, keep the “Mark 
all time entries as billable” 
checkbox turned on. That 
way, whenever you start 
a new time record, the 
Billable checkbox will be 
turned on. 
On the other hand, if you 
charge by the hour for 
only a couple of projects, 
turn off the “Mark all 
time entries as billable” 
checkbox.
QuickBooks automatically sets the “First Day of Work Week” box to Monday to 
match the Monday-through-Friday workweek of so many businesses. For round-the-
clock services, self-employed people, and workaholics, choose whichever day feels 
most like the beginning of the week. For example, many companies on a seven-day 
workweek start the week on Sunday. If you use QuickBooks to generate hours for 
payroll, you should set the program’s workweek to end on the same day as your pay 
periods. For instance, if your payroll cutoff dates are on Fridays, in the “First Day of 
Work Week” drop-down list, choose Saturday so that QuickBooks’ workweek ends 
on Friday, just like your payroll.

Setting Up the People Who Track Time
You can’t enter or import people’s time into QuickBooks unless their names appear 
in one of your name lists (the Employee List, Vendor List, or Other Names List). If 
someone whose time you want to track isn’t on one of those lists yet, here’s how 
you decide which list to use:
• Employee List. Use this list for your employees whether you pay them using 
QuickBooks’ payroll features or in some other way.
• Vendor List. Add subcontractors and outside consultants (people or companies 
that send you bills for time) to this list, whether or not their time is billable to 
customers. (Their time is undoubtedly billable to you.)
• Other Names List. By process of elimination, anyone who isn’t a vendor or an 
employee belongs on this list, such as owners who take a draw or partners who 
take distributions instead of a paycheck (page 419).
People who enter time in QuickBooks (with a weekly timesheet or in the Time/
Enter Single Activity dialog box, not with the standalone Timer program) need the 
program’s permission to do so. When you set up QuickBooks users, you can set their 
permissions so they can enter time (page 727).
Setting Up Items and Customers for Time Tracking
The good news is that you don’t have to do any additional item and customer setup 
to be able to bill time to your customers. The Service items (page 108) and customer 
records (page 70) you create for invoicing also work for tracking billable time. When 
you enter time, you choose the Service item you’re working on. QuickBooks then 
totals your hours and figures out how much to charge the customer based on the 
number of hours you worked and how much you charge per hour for that service.
The only reason you’d need additional items is if you track all the hours that people 
work, both billable and nonbillable. For example, if you’re trying to reduce overhead 
costs, you might add items to track the time spent on administrative work or provid­
ing customer service, as shown in Figure 8-2. (Page 106 explains how to add items.) 
The level of detail you track in QuickBooks for nonbillable activities is up to you.
Here’s how you fill in the New Item dialog box’s fields when you create items to track 
time that you don’t bill to a customer:
• Type. Use the Service item type (page 108) because that’s the only one Quick­
Books’ time-tracking feature recognizes.
• Rate. This is where you enter how much you charge for the service. Because no 
money changes hands for nonbillable time, leave this field set to 0.

FIGURE 8-2
If you want to capture 
nonbillable activities 
in one big pot, create a 
single Service item called 
Overhead. 
For greater detail about 
nonbillable time, you can 
create a top-level Over-
head item and then create 
subitems for each type of 
nonbillable work you want 
to track. Be sure to also 
create one catchall item, 
such as Other, to capture 
the time that doesn’t fit 
in any other nonbillable 
category.
• Account. You can’t create an item without assigning it to an account, so cre­
ate an expense account (page 56) and call it something like Nonbillable Work 
or Overhead Time. If you number accounts, assign the account a number that 
places it near the end of your Expense type accounts (like 8230).
• This service is used in assemblies or is performed by a subcontractor or part­
ner. If a subcontractor performs nonbillable work for you, turn on this checkbox. 
That way, you can assign the subcontractor’s costs to an expense account and 
use time tracking to make sure the subcontractor’s bills are correct. For nonbill­
able items performed by owners and partners, leave this checkbox turned off.
Entering Time in QuickBooks
QuickBooks lets you enter and view time for a single activity or for whole weeks. If 
you record time after the fact, a weekly timesheet is the fastest way to enter time 
(and you can enter weekly timesheets for more than one person at once). If you 
already have one timesheet filled out, you can copy it to speed up your data entry, 
as the box on page 171 explains.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

ENTERING 
TIME IN 
QUICKBOOKS
To time work as you perform it, the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box (explained 
starting on page 171) is the way to go.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Time by the Batch
QuickBooks’ Weekly Timesheet window lets you create 
timesheets for several people at the same time. The only 
limitation is that the entries in the weekly timesheet have to 
be identical for all the people you select—that is, the same 
customer and job, Service item, notes, class, and hours each 
day. And if the people are paid through payroll, the Payroll 
item has to be the same, too.
Here’s how to create a batch timesheet:
1.	 In the Home Page’s Employees panel, click Enter Time 
and then, on the drop-down menu, choose Use Weekly 
Timesheet.
2.	 In the Weekly Timesheet window’s Name drop-down 
list, choose “Multiple names (Payroll)” if the people are 
paid through your payroll service, or choose “Multiple 
names (Non-Payroll)” if they’re paid another way, such 
as vendors, contractors, or owners who take an owners’ 
draw.
3.	 In the “Select Employee, Vendor or Other Name” dialog 
box, keep the Manual option selected and then click 
the name of each person you want to add to the batch 
timesheet to add a checkmark to the left of their names.
4.	 Click OK.
5.	 Fill out the weekly timesheet as you would for a single 
person (see below), and then click Save & Close.
QuickBooks creates a timesheet for each person you selected 
with the information you entered in the timesheet. For ex-
ample, if you recorded 40 hours of work in the timesheet, each 
person now has a timesheet showing 40 hours.
Filling Out Weekly Timesheets
QuickBooks’ weekly timesheet is the fastest way to enter time for several activities 
or work that spans several days. Here’s what you do:
1.	 In the Home Page’s Employees panel, click Enter Time and then, on the 
drop-down menu, choose Use Weekly Timesheet.
QuickBooks opens the Weekly Timesheet window.
 NOTE 	 Even though you can track time for people other than employees (like contractors), you access 
QuickBooks’ time tracking feature from the Employees menu or the Employees panel on the Home Page.
2.	 In the Name drop-down list, choose the person who performed the work.
Because time tracking is rarely limited to only the people with permission to use 
QuickBooks, you can enter time for yourself or anyone else. After you choose 
a name, the program displays a timesheet for the current week and shows any 
time already entered for that week, as shown in Figure 8-3. (See the box above 
to learn how to create a batch of timesheets in one fell swoop.)

FIGURE 8-3
The weekly timesheet 
doesn’t provide much 
room to display customer 
names, job names, or 
more than a few letters 
of the Service item for 
the task performed. To 
see the full contents of a 
cell, click the cell’s down 
arrow, and QuickBooks 
highlights the selected 
item in the drop-down 
list. If the cell doesn’t have 
a down arrow, position 
your cursor over the cell 
to display a popup tooltip. 
You can also drag a corner 
of the window to resize it 
or click the Maximize icon 
(the rectangle) near the 
top right of the window to 
enlarge it.
3.	 To enter time for a different week, in the window’s toolbar, click Previous 
or Next until the week you want appears.
To choose a week that’s quite a ways in the past, click the calendar icon to the 
right of the timesheet’s date range. In the Set Date dialog box that appears, 
click the arrows to the left or right of the month heading to move to a past or 
future month. Click any date during the week to choose that workweek. For 
example, choosing 6 in the March 2015 calendar switches the timesheet to the 
week beginning March 2, 2015.
 TIP 	 If an earlier timesheet has entries with customers and items that apply to the current timesheet, you 
can copy the earlier timesheet as described in the box on page 171.
4.	 In the first blank Customer:Job cell (the first column of the timesheet table), 
choose the customer or job associated with the work that was performed, 
if applicable.
If the work is billable, choose the customer or job that pays for it. If the time 
isn’t billable, you can leave this cell blank or choose the customer you created 
to track nonbillable time. Depending on whether you prefer to keep your hands

on the keyboard or the mouse, you can then move to the Service Item cell by 
clicking it or by pressing the Tab key.
5.	 In the Service Item cell, choose the item that represents the work the person 
performed.
If you use a QuickBooks’ payroll service and pay employees by the hours they 
work, the Payroll Item column appears to the right of the Service Item column, 
so you can also fill in the payroll-related item that applies to the time worked. 
For example, for billable work, choose a Payroll item such as Salary or Employee 
Income. If the hours are for vacation or sick time, choose the Payroll item you’ve 
created for that kind of time.
6.	 In the Notes cell, type any additional information about the work.
If your customers require details about the work performed, store that info in 
the Notes cell, which then appears on the invoices you create (see page 255).
 TIP 	 To see the entire contents of Notes cells, make sure the “Wrap text in Notes field” checkbox at the bottom 
of the Weekly Timesheet window is turned on. That way, each row in the Timesheet table takes up more space, 
but you won’t have to position your cursor over every Notes cell to see what it contains.
7.	 If you use classes to track income and expenses (page 140), in the Class 
column, choose one for the work.
This column appears only if you’ve turned on QuickBooks’ class preference. If 
you track profit by partner, for example, choose the class for the partner who 
handles that customer. If you use classes to track office branches, choose the 
class for the branch where the person works.
8.	 To enter time for a day during the week, click the cell for that day or press 
the Tab key until you reach the right cell.
You can enter time in several ways. If you know the number of hours, type them 
as a decimal or as hours and minutes. For example, for seven and a half hours, 
type either 7.5 or 7:30. QuickBooks displays the hours in the timesheet based 
on the time format preference you set (page 651). If you know the starting and 
ending time, QuickBooks can calculate the hours for you. For example, if you 
type 9-5 in a cell, the program transforms it into eight hours when you move 
to a different cell (by pressing Tab or clicking another cell).
As you enter time for each day of the week, the Total column on the right side 
of the table shows the total hours for each activity. The numbers in the Totals 
row below the table show the total hours for each day and for the entire week.

ENTERING 
TIME IN 
QUICKBOOKS
 NOTE 	 Each row in a weekly timesheet represents one Service item, one customer or job, and one note. So 
if you perform the same type of work for two different customers, you have to enter that time in two separate 
rows. You also have to create another row if you want to record a different note for the same customer and the 
same Service item. You might do this if, for example, you did web-development work for a customer but want 
to differentiate the work you did on its online-store web page and on its marketing web pages.
9.	 If the time is for overhead or you aren’t billing the customer for the work 
and the checkmark in the “Billable?” column is turned on, click it to turn it 
off. Conversely, if the checkmark is turned off and the time is billable, click 
the checkbox to turn it on.
If you’ve turned on the “Mark all time entries as billable” preference (page 669), 
QuickBooks automatically puts a checkmark in the “Billable?” column. If this 
preference is turned off, the “Billable?” checkbox is blank unless you click it.
 TIP 	 Adding billable time to customer invoices is easy; it’s described in detail on page 252.
10.	 To save the timesheet, click Save & Close or Save & New.
If you’re entering time for a number of people, click Save & New to save the 
current timesheet and open a new, blank one. Clicking Save & Close saves the 
timesheet and closes the Weekly Timesheet window.
UP TO SPEED
Copying Timesheets
People often work on the same tasks from week to week. 
QuickBooks can reduce tedium and mistakes—and save you 
time—by copying entries from a person’s previous timesheet. 
Here’s how:
1.	 In the Weekly Timesheet window’s Name field, choose 
the person’s name.
2.	 Display the weekly timesheet you want to copy 
information into by clicking Previous or Next, or clicking 
the calendar icon.
3.	 At the bottom of the dialog box, click the Copy Last 
Sheet button. If the timesheet that’s currently displayed 
is empty, QuickBooks fills in all the rows with the 
entries from the person’s last timesheet, including the 
customer, Service item, class, notes, and hours. If the 
current timesheet already has values, QuickBooks asks 
whether you want to replace the entries. Click Yes to 
replace the entries with the ones from the last timesheet 
you opened. Click No to append the entries from the last 
timesheet as additional rows in this week’s timesheet. 
To keep the currently displayed timesheet just the way 
it is, click Cancel.
Entering Time for One Activity
Entering time in the Weekly Timesheet window is quick, but the width of the columns 
makes it hard to see which customer and Service item you’re tracking. If you prefer 
readability to speed, the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box is a better choice. It 
even includes a stopwatch you can use to time your work.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

ENTERING

 TIP 	 One drawback to the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box is that you have to fill in every field for every 
activity. If you grow tired of this form of time entry, then in the dialog box’s toolbar, click Timesheet to switch to 
the Weekly Timesheet window. The weekly timesheet that appears is for the person you selected in the Time/
Enter Single Activity dialog box and the week that includes the selected day.
Here’s how to enter time for one activity at a time:
1.	 In the Home Page’s Employees panel, click Enter Time and then, on the 
drop-down menu, choose Time/Enter Single Activity.
The Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box opens to today’s date.
2.	 If you want to record time for a different day, then in the Date field, click the 
calendar icon and choose the date when the work took place.
When you first open the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box, QuickBooks 
selects all the text in the Date box. You can replace that date by simply typing 
a new one, like 3/6/15.
3.	 In the Name drop-down list—which includes vendors, employees, and names 
from the Other Names List—select the person who performed the work.
Employees and other names are near the end of the list.
 NOTE 	 When you first open the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box, it includes the Payroll Item field. If 
you select an employee who’s paid based on her time (see online Appendix D on this book’s Missing CD page at 
www.missingmanuals.com), then use this field to select the Payroll item to which the time applies so that the 
time data generates the values on the person’s paycheck. If you choose the name of a person who isn’t paid 
based on her time, then the Payroll Item field disappears.
4.	 In the Customer:Job drop-down list, choose a customer or job.
If someone performs work for a real customer or job, choose that customer or 
job whether or not you bill the time. To track overhead time, you can create a 
customer (page 70) called something like Overhead.
5.	 If the time is billable and the “Billable?” checkbox in the upper-right corner 
of the window is turned off, click it to turn it on. For nonbillable time, make 
sure the “Billable?” checkbox is turned off.
If you’ve turned on the “Mark all time entries as billable” preference (page 669), 
QuickBooks puts a checkmark in the “Billable?” checkbox automatically. If that 
preference is turned off, the “Billable?” checkbox is blank unless you click it.
6.	 In the Service Item drop-down list, choose the item that represents the 
work performed.
Choose the appropriate item, whether it’s one you use to invoice customers or 
a nonbillable item you created to track overhead activities. When you’re done, 
press the Tab key to move to the Duration box (or just click it).

Chapter 8: Tracking Time and Mileage

7.	 In the Duration box, enter the hours worked.
If you pressed Tab to move to the Duration box, QuickBooks automatically se­
lects the contents of the box, so you can simply type the hours worked. If you 
clicked the Duration box instead, drag to select its contents.
Enter hours as a decimal or as hours and minutes, such as 5.5 or 5:30. Or, if 
you know the starting and ending times, type the range to have QuickBooks 
calculate the hours. For example, if you type 11-5, the program converts it to 
6:00 when you tab or click away from the Duration box.
If you work in QuickBooks most of the time, you can also use the Time/Enter 
Single Activity dialog box to time your work, as shown in Figure 8-4.
FIGURE 8-4
To time your current 
activity, the Date field has 
to be set to today, since 
you can’t run a stopwatch

which is grayed out here. 
You’ll see the seconds that 
are passing to the right of 
the Duration box (where 
it says “55” here) to show 
that QuickBooks is timing 
your work. To pause the 
stopwatch, click Pause; 
click Start to start timing 
again. When you finish the 
task, click Stop. As long as 
the stopwatch isn’t timing, 
you can edit the time by 
typing the time you want.
 NOTE 	 If you click Previous at the top of the Time/Enter Single Activity dialog box to display another single 
activity for today and then click Start, the stopwatch feature starts adding additional time to what you’ve already 
recorded.
8.	 If you track classes, in the Class field, choose the appropriate one. (This 
field appears only if classes are turned on.) To add notes about the activity, 
type them in the Notes box.
These notes appear in the Notes column of the Weekly Timesheet window and, 
for billable work, appear on invoices you generate from time worked.

REPORTS
9.	 To save the transaction, click Save & New or Save & Close.
When you click Save & New, the saved activity represents time for only one day. 
To record time for another day’s work (even if it’s for the same worker, customer, 
and Service item), you have to create a new activity.
Running Time Reports
Customers don’t like being charged for too many hours, and workers are quick to 
complain if they’re paid for too few. So before you use time records either for billing 
customers or feeding your payroll records, it’s a good idea to generate reports to 
make sure your time data is correct. (Online Appendix D—available from this book’s 
Missing CD page at www.missingmanuals.com/cds—explains how to set up employ­
ees in QuickBooks so their reported time links to your QuickBooks payroll service.)
To generate a time report in QuickBooks, choose Reports→Jobs, Time & Mileage, 
and then select the report you want. Here are the ones you can choose from and 
what they’re useful for:
• Time by Job Summary. If you bill by the job, this handy report shows hours by 
customer or job, summarized by Service items, which helps you review the total 
hours worked on a job during a given period. Because of its high-level view, 
this report is perfect for spotting time charged to inappropriate Service items 
or hours that exceed job limits. Overly high or low hours—or Service items that 
don’t belong on a job—are red flags for data-entry errors. If hours seem too 
high or low, you can drill down with the Time by Job Detail report (described 
next) to investigate.
• Time by Job Detail. Use this report to verify that hours were correctly set as bill­
able or nonbillable. It’s grouped first by customer/job, and then by Service item, 
but each time entry shows the date the hours were worked, who performed the 
work, and whether the work is billable (the billing status is listed as Unbilled for 
billable hours not yet invoiced, Billed for invoiced billable hours, or Not Billable).
• Time by Name. This report shows the hours people have worked on each 
customer or job, as shown in Figure 8-5. QuickBooks initially sets the report’s 
date range to This Fiscal Year-to-date, but if you want to check timesheets for 
accuracy, you can change it to Last Week, This Week, or whatever time period 
you want. If a person reports too many or too few hours for a period, use the 
Weekly Timesheet window (page 168) to look for signs of inaccurate or miss­
ing time reports.
• Time by Item. This report groups hours by Service item and then by customer 
or job. You can use this report to analyze how your billable and nonbillable time 
is spent, either to cut unproductive activities or to determine staffing needs.

Tracking Mileage
If you charge customers for mileage, keeping track of the billable miles you drive 
helps you get all the reimbursements you’re due. But all business-related mileage is 
tax-deductible, so tracking nonbillable business mileage is important, too. Custom­
ers and the IRS alike want records of the miles you drive, and QuickBooks can help 
you produce that documentation.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks’ mileage-tracking feature is intended for tracking the miles you drive using company 
vehicles (and, if you run your own company, the business miles you drive using your own car), not other vehicle 
expenses, such as fuel or tolls. Likewise, you don’t use QuickBooks to record miles driven by employees, vendors, 
or subcontractors, which instead go straight to an expense account. For example, if a vendor bills you for mileage, 
when you enter the bill in QuickBooks (page 186), you assign that charge to an expense account you’ve created 
for such things, such as Travel-Mileage. Or when you write a check to reimburse an employee for mileage driven, 
you assign that reimbursement to the expense account for mileage.

Adding a Vehicle
To track mileage for a company vehicle, you first have to add the vehicle to Quick­
Books’ Vehicle List. Here’s how:
1.	 Open the Vehicle List window by choosing Lists→Customer & Vendor Profile 
Lists→Vehicle List.
2.	 To add a new vehicle, press Ctrl+N or click Vehicle→New.
The New Vehicle window (Figure 8-6) opens.
3.	 In the Vehicle field, type a name for the vehicle.
To easily identify your company cars and trucks, include the type of vehicle 
and a way to differentiate it from others. For instance, if your company’s cars 
are all white Jeeps, use the license plate number as the name rather than the 
make and color.
FIGURE 8-6
QuickBooks doesn’t want to 
know much about company 
vehicles. All you have to do 
is give the vehicle a name. If 
you like, you can add details 
in the Description box. 
After you click OK, the vehicle 
takes its place in the Vehicle 
List (shown in the background 
here).
4.	 In the Description box, type additional info such as the year, make, model, 
license plate number, or vehicle identification number (VIN).
To change this information later, in the Vehicle List window, double-click the ve­
hicle’s name and then, in the Edit Vehicle dialog box, edit the name or description.
5.	 Click OK.
That’s it. The name and description appear in the Vehicle List window.

TRACKING 
MILEAGE
Setting the Mileage Rate
For tax purposes, you can deduct mileage expenses based on a standard rate or 
by tracking the actual costs of operating and maintaining your vehicles. Using a 
standard mileage rate is convenient—simply multiply the miles you drove by this rate 
to calculate your vehicle deduction. The box on page 178 explains how you charge 
customers for mileage if your mileage charge differs from the IRS standard rate. 
(You don’t have to set a mileage rate to record the miles you drive, but you’ll need 
a rate in place before you run your tax reports.)
 TIP 	 If you own an expensive car with expensive maintenance needs, actual costs might provide a larger 
deduction than the IRS’s standard rate. (You can deduct either the standard-rate amount or your actual costs, not 
both.) But to deduct what you spend on gas, tires, repairs, insurance, and so on, you have to keep track of these 
expenses. As usual, the tax rules for deducting operating and maintenance costs are, well, taxing. So before you 
choose this approach, ask your accountant or the IRS if you can deduct actual costs and whether it’s the best 
approach.
QuickBooks stores multiple mileage rates along with their effective dates, because 
standard mileage rates usually change at the beginning of each calendar year. Here’s 
how to set a mileage rate:
1.	 Choose Company→Enter Vehicle Mileage.
The Enter Vehicle Mileage window opens.

3.	 To add a new rate, click the first blank Effective Date cell at the bottom of 
the list, and then choose the date that the new mileage rate becomes ef­
fective, such as 1/1/2015.
You can either type the date or click the calendar icon.
4.	 In the Rate cell, type the rate in dollars, such as .56 for 56 cents.
The mileage rate is 56 cents per mile beginning January 1, 2014, as documented 
on the IRS website, www.irs.gov. If you’re reading this after 2014, be sure to 
check that site to see whether this rate has changed.
5.	 Click Close.
When it’s time to prepare your tax return, you can run the Mileage by Vehicle 
Summary report to see the miles driven for each company vehicle and the result­
ing mileage deduction. To calculate your deduction, QuickBooks multiplies the 
recorded miles by the mileage rate that was in effect when they were driven.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Mileage Rates and Invoice Items
What if the IRS’s rate is different from the rate I charge custom-
ers for mileage?
The rates you enter in the Mileage Rates window (page 177) 
are the standard rates set by the IRS for tax purposes. The IRS 
doesn’t care one whit what you charge your customers for 
miles, so you can charge them whatever you want. And you 
don’t have to record mileage driven to do that.
For the reimbursable miles that you drive, you need to create a 
Service or Other Charge item in your Item List. (Why? Because, 
in the Enter Vehicle Mileage window, the Item drop-down list 
includes only these two types of items.) When you create the 
item, you can assign it the rate that you charge customers 
per mile or, if you charge variable mileage rates, leave the 
rate at zero.
For an Other Charge item, the “Amount or %” box is the place 
to enter the mileage rate, as shown in Figure 8-8. (For a Service 
item, use the Rate box instead.) In the Account box, choose the 
income or expense account you use for reimbursable mileage, 
whether it’s specific to mileage or a catchall reimbursable cost 
account.  Then you can either record mileage driven using this 
item or simply add the item to an invoice and fill in the quantity 
cell with the miles you drove.
Recording Mileage Driven
Once you’ve added a vehicle to the Vehicle List, you’re ready to record mileage. 
Here’s how you fill in the Enter Vehicle Mileage window to record billable and non­
billable miles you’ve driven:
1.	 Open the Enter Vehicle Mileage window (Company→Enter Vehicle Mileage) 
and then, in the Vehicle box, choose the vehicle that you drove.
If you forgot to add the vehicle to QuickBooks’ Vehicle List, you can create it 
now by choosing <Add New> from the drop-down menu.

FIGURE 8-8
When you create an item for 
mileage, you can enter what-
ever rate per mile you want. 
Then, when you add mileage 
to an invoice, QuickBooks mul-
tiplies the number of billable 
miles driven by the rate you set 
for that mileage item.
2.	 In the Trip Start Date and Trip End Date boxes, choose when you started 
and completed the trip.
If you’re recording mileage for one day of onsite work, choose the same day in 
both boxes. On the other hand, if you used a company car to drive to another 
city for several days, the Trip Start Date is the day you headed out of town and 
the Trip End Date is the day you returned.
3.	 In the Odometer Start and Odometer End boxes, type what the vehicle’s 
mileage was before you began driving and what it was when you returned, as 
shown in Figure 8-9. Or just type how far you drove into the Total Miles box.
If you fill in the Odometer boxes, QuickBooks automatically calculates the miles 
you drove and plops that number in the Total Miles box.
FIGURE 8-9
If you usually forget to check 
your starting mileage, you can 
ignore the Odometer Start and 
Odometer End boxes entirely. 
Instead, in the Total Miles box, 
type the mileage you drove, 
such as 1,586 for a 1,586-mile 
trip for your customer. You 
can type the mileage with or 
without commas (1,586 or 1586).

GENERATING 
MILEAGE 
REPORTS
 NOTE 	 The drawback to filling in the Enter Vehicle Mileage dialog box’s Total Miles field is that your mileage 
record doesn’t include the odometer readings that the IRS wants to see. But if every mile you drive is for business, 
you can prove your deduction by showing the IRS an odometer reading at the beginning of the year and one at 
the end of the year.
4.	 If your mileage is billable to a customer or job, turn on the Billable check­
box. Then, in the Customer:Job box, choose the customer or job to which 
you want to assign the mileage and, in the Item drop-down list, choose the 
item you created for mileage (see the box on page 178).
If the mileage isn’t billable to a customer, keep the Billable checkbox turned off 
and leave the Customer:Job and Item boxes blank.
5.	 If you track classes, then in the Class box, choose the appropriate one.
For example, if you use classes to track branch performance, choose the class 
for the branch the vehicle belongs to. However, if you track partner income with 
classes and the mileage is nonbillable, you don’t need to assign a class (or you 
can choose a class you set up for overhead).
6.	 To document the reason for the mileage, type details in the Notes box. Then, 
to save the mileage and close the dialog box, click Save & Close.
If you want to enter additional mileage for other customers and jobs, click Save 
& New instead.
Generating Mileage Reports
Mileage reports come in handy when you prepare your taxes or if your customers 
question their mileage charges. These reports are simple, mainly because you don’t 
track that much mileage information in QuickBooks. You can generate mileage 
reports by choosing Reports→Jobs, Time & Mileage, and then selecting a report. 
Or, if you have the Enter Vehicle Mileage window open, in the window’s toolbar, 
click the down arrow to the right of the Mileage Reports button and select a report.
Here are the reports you can choose and what they’re useful for:
• Mileage by Vehicle Summary. For your tax documentation, this report shows 
the total miles you drove each vehicle and the corresponding mileage expense 
(which QuickBooks calculates using the standard IRS mileage rate in effect at 
the time). The date range is initially set to This Tax Year. If you wait until after 
January 1 to gather your tax documentation, then in the Dates box, choose Last 
Tax Year instead.

REPORTS
• Mileage by Vehicle Detail. This report shows each trip that contributed to a 
vehicle’s mileage. For each one, it includes the trip’s end date, miles driven, 
mileage rate, and mileage expense. If you have questions about your deduc­
tions, double-click an entry to open the Enter Vehicle Mileage window for that 
transaction.
• Mileage by Job Summary. If you charge customers for mileage, run this re­
port to see both total miles driven and the billable mileage by customer and 
job. QuickBooks uses the rate you set in the Service or Other Charge item to 
calculate the billable amount.
• Mileage by Job Detail. If a customer has a question about mileage you charged, 
this report is the quickest way to find those charges. The report groups mileage 
by customer or job but lists each trip in its own line. The report shows each 
trip’s end date, miles driven, billing status, mileage rate, and billable amount, so 
you can answer almost any mileage-related question a customer might have.

CHAPTER
9
A
lthough most small business owners sift through the daily mail looking for 
envelopes containing payments, they usually find more containing bills. One 
frustrating aspect of running a business is that you often have to pay for the 
items you sell before you can invoice your customers for the goods.
If you want your financial records to be right, you have to tell QuickBooks about the 
expenses you’ve incurred. And, if you want your vendors to leave you alone, you 
have to pay the bills they send. Paying for expenses can take several forms, and 
QuickBooks is up to the challenge.
This chapter explains your choices for paying bills (now or later) and describes how 
to enter bills and record your bill payments. If you pay right away, you’ll learn the 
QuickBooks procedures for writing checks, using a debit or credit card, and paying 
with cash, among other options. If you enter bills in QuickBooks for payment later, 
you’ll learn how to handle the recurring ones, such as rent, as well as reimbursable 
expenses and inventory. QuickBooks is happy to help you through every step of the 
process: entering bills you receive if you want to pay later, setting up bill payments, 
and even printing checks you can mail to vendors.
When to Pay Expenses
When it comes to handling expenses, you can pay now or pay later; QuickBooks has 
features for both options. (You can choose to not pay bills, but QuickBooks can’t 
help you with collection agencies or represent your company in bankruptcy court.) 
Here are the pros and cons of each approach:
	 	
Paying for Expenses

ENTERING 
BILLS
• Pay now. If bills arrive about as infrequently as meteor showers, why not pay 
each one immediately so you’re sure they’re paid on time? In QuickBooks, paying 
right away means writing a check, entering a debit card transaction, entering 
a credit card charge, making an online payment, or using money from petty 
cash—all of which are described in this chapter. When you pay immediately, you 
don’t have to enter a bill in QuickBooks; you can simply record the expense-
payment transaction.
 NOTE 	 When you’re out of the office and pay for something by charging it to a credit card or writing a check 
by hand, simply enter that transaction in QuickBooks without entering a corresponding bill. (See page 214 for info 
on recording payments made with debit cards, PayPal, and so on.)
• Pay later. If bills arrive as steadily as orders at the local coffee shop, you’ll prob­
ably want to set aside time to pay them all at once when it won’t interfere with 
delivering services or selling products. What’s more, most companies don’t 
pay bills until just before they’re due—unless there’s a good reason to (like an 
early payment discount). Setting up vendor bills for later payment is known as 
using Accounts Payable because you store the unpaid expenses in an Accounts 
Payable account.
In QuickBooks, entering bills for later payment delivers all the advantages of 
convenience and good cash management. You can tell the program when you 
want to pay bills—for instance, to take advantage of an early payment discount 
or the grace period that a vendor allows. Then you can go about your business 
without distraction, knowing that QuickBooks will notify you when bills are on 
deck for payment.
Once you decide whether you’re going to pay bills now or later, use that method 
consistently. Otherwise, you could pay for something twice by entering a bill in 
QuickBooks and then, a few days later, writing a paper check for the same expense. 
To prevent duplicate payments, always enter bills you receive in the mail (or email) 
as bills in QuickBooks and pay them by using the Pay Bills feature (page 194). The 
Enter Bills window (Figure 9-1) includes a list of recent transactions, which you can 
use to look for payments you’ve already made.
Entering Bills
At first glance, entering bills in QuickBooks and then paying them later might seem 
like more work than just writing checks. But as you’ll learn in this chapter, there 
are several advantages to entering bills in QuickBooks, and the program makes it 
incredibly easy to pay them.

FIGURE 9-1
The Terms field (circled) 
shows the payment terms 
from the vendor’s record 
(page 84). If you haven’t 
assigned payment terms 
to a vendor, you can do 
so right in the Enter Bills 
window by simply clicking 
the Terms field’s down 
arrow and choosing from 
the drop-down list that 
appears. When you save 
the bill, QuickBooks asks 
if you want the new terms 
to appear the next time. 
The program is asking 
whether you want to save 
the terms to the vendor’s 
record; click Yes.
To get started, open the Enter Bills window using any of the following methods:
• On the Home Page, in the Vendors panel, click Enter Bills.
• Choose Vendors→Enter Bills.
• In the Vendor Center window’s icon bar, click New Transactions→Enter Bills.
 TIP 	 Many of your bills are due at the same time every month, and some are even the same amount every 
month, such as your office rent. Bills like these are perfect candidates for QuickBooks’ memorized transaction 
feature, which memorizes bills so you can reuse them. With a memorized transaction, you can tell QuickBooks 
to remind you when a bill is due or even record it automatically without any action on your part. You can even 
create a group of bills so that you can process all the bills due on the same day of the month with just a click or 
two. See page 321 for the full scoop on these handy timesavers.
The fields in the Enter Bills window are similar to the ones on invoices you create. In 
fact, if your vendors use QuickBooks, the bills you receive are just another company’s 
QuickBooks invoices (see Chapter 10) or statements (see Chapter 11).

Entering Bills for Services and Non-Inventory Items
This section explains how to enter bills for services you’ve hired someone to perform 
and non-inventory items you’ve purchased, such as products you purchase specifi­
cally for a customer or job. (The process of purchasing and paying for inventory 
items is similar but a tad more complicated; it’s explained on page 518.) Here’s how 
to enter all your non-inventory bills in QuickBooks:
1.	 In the Enter Bills window’s Vendor drop-down list, choose the vendor who 
billed you.
Above the Bill area, QuickBooks automatically chooses the Bill option so you 
can record a vendor bill. (You’ll learn about recording credits from vendors 
on page 217.) The program also turns on the Bill Received checkbox. Turn this 
checkbox off only if you receive a shipment of inventory without a bill; you’ll 
learn how to deal with such shipments on page 530.
If you set up any pre-fill accounts in the vendor’s record (page 85), QuickBooks 
automatically adds them to the Expenses tab of the table near the bottom of 
the Enter Bills window.
2.	 If you have open purchase orders with the vendor you selected, the Open 
POs Exist message box appears. If the bill corresponds to one or more of 
those POs, in the message box, click Yes.
Page 527 explains how to record bills that correspond to purchase orders 
you’ve created.
3.	 In the Date box, type or select the date you received the bill.
If you specified payment terms in the vendor’s record (page 84), QuickBooks 
uses the date you enter in the Date box to figure out when the bill is due and 
fills in the Bill Due field, as shown in Figure 9-1. For example, if the bill date is 
5/6/2015 and the vendor’s payment terms are Net 30, the bill is due 30 days 
after the bill date—6/5/2015.
If the date that QuickBooks fills in doesn’t match the due date on the bill you 
received, then in the Bill Due field, enter the date printed on the vendor’s bill—
it’s the one to go by.
 TIP 	 The Vendor tab on the right side of the Enter Bills window summarizes the vendor’s info and your recent 
transactions with that vendor. The Summary section shows your balance (the total amount you owe the vendor) 
and open purchase orders with that vendor. If you see any info you want to change, like the terms or address, 
click the Edit button (its icon looks like a pencil) to open the vendor’s record in the Edit Vendor dialog box. The 
Vendor tab’s Recent Transactions section lists bills, bill payments, credits, and other transactions, which is a great 
way to catch that you have a credit available or have already paid the bill you’re about to enter. To open one of 
these recent transactions in its corresponding window, click a link, like the “Bill” link labeled in Figure 9-1.

4.	 In the Ref. No. box, type the vendor’s invoice number, the statement date, 
or another identifying feature of the bill you’re paying.
The Ref. No. box accepts any alphanumeric character, not just numbers, so you 
can type in things like “1242,” “Invoice 1242,” or “Statement 3/31/2015.”
If you want to include additional notes about the bill, type them in the Memo box.
5.	 In the Amount Due box, type the total from the bill.
The only time you’d type a different amount is when you take a discount that 
the vendor forgot to apply or deduct a portion of the bill because the goods 
were defective.
In the lower half of the Enter Bills window, QuickBooks initially displays the 
Expenses tab, which is where you enter information about expenses such as 
utility bills, office supply bills, and attorney’s fees. If you assign only one pre-fill 
account (page 85) to this vendor, QuickBooks automatically fills in the first cell 
in the table’s Amount column with the Amount Due value.
 NOTE 	 The section “Entering Bills in Foreign Currencies” on page 188 tells you what to do when you receive 
a bill from a vendor who uses a different currency.
6.	 In the first cell of the Expenses tab’s Account column, choose the expense 
account from your chart of accounts that corresponds to the first expense 
on the bill.
When you click a cell in the Account column, a down arrow appears. Clicking 
the arrow displays a drop-down list of every account in your chart of accounts, 
but QuickBooks automatically displays the expense account section of the list. 
To choose a different expense account—the one for your legal fees, say—scroll 
in the drop-down list and click the one you want.
7.	 If the bill covers several types of expenses (such as airfare, lodging, and your 
travel agent’s fees), in the first Amount cell, type the amount that belongs 
to the expense account in that row.
If you assign more than one pre-fill account to a vendor, QuickBooks subtracts 
the amount you typed in the first row from the total amount due and puts the 
remaining amount in the second row. Bottom line: You have to type the amounts 
in each row’s Amount cell.
8.	 If an expense relates to a job, in the Customer:Job column, choose the 
customer or job.
If you fill in the Customer:Job cell, QuickBooks puts a checkmark in the “Bill­
able?” column. If you don’t want to charge the customer for the expense, click 
the checkmark to remove it.

 TIP 	 If you’re recording reimbursable expenses, which will eventually appear on a customer’s invoice (page 
252), be sure to type a meaningful description in each Memo cell in the table. QuickBooks uses the text in this cell 
as the description of the expense on your invoice. If there’s no Memo text, your invoice includes charges without 
descriptions, which are bound to generate a call from the customer.
9.	 If you’re tracking classes, choose the appropriate class for the expense.
The Expenses tab’s Class column appears only if you use QuickBooks classes 
(page 140).
10.	 If the bill you’re entering includes different types of expenses, repeat steps 
6–9 to add a row for each type, as shown in Figure 9-2.
As soon as you finish one row in the table, QuickBooks fills in the Amount cell 
in the next row with the amount that’s still unallocated. For the first through 
the next-to-last row, you have to edit the amount that the program fills in to 
match your expense. The amount QuickBooks enters in the last row should be 
correct if you haven’t made any typos.
If the multiple accounts and amounts are hopelessly mangled, at the top of the 
Enter Bills window, click Clear Splits to clear the table so you can start over.
11.	 To add an item to a bill—such as a Service, Non-inventory Part, or Other 
Charge item—click the Items tab. In the first cell of the Item column, choose 
the item you want to add, and then fill in the other cells in the row, as you 
did on the Expenses tab.
The program fills in the Description and Cost cells with the values from the item’s 
record. If you want, you can type a different description and enter a new cost.
12.	 Click Save & Close to save the bill and close the window.
Or, if you have other bills to enter, click Save & New to save that bill and display 
a new, blank one.
Entering Bills in Foreign Currencies 
Before you can enter bills with values in foreign currencies, you have to turn on 
QuickBooks’ multiple currencies preference by choosing Edit→Preferences→Multiple 
Currencies, clicking the Company Preferences tab, and then selecting the “Yes, I 
use more than one currency” option (see page 656 for details). After that, you can 
assign a currency to each vendor. In the New Vendor or Edit Vendor window (page 
84), below and to the right of the Vendor Name box, choose the currency that the 
vendor uses. 
Once you do that, the Enter Bills window displays the vendor’s currency in several 
places. It appears in the window’s title bar and to the right of the vendor’s name, as 
shown in Figure 9-3. The Amount Due box also shows the foreign currency to the 
left of the amount, with the corresponding value in your home currency below it. 
And the Expenses and Items tabs both show the foreign currency to indicate that 
the values you enter are in that currency.

If you pay bills in several 
different currencies, you 
need an Accounts Pay-

can recalculate the gains 
or losses from changes in 
each exchange rate.
5.	 Below the Expenses and Items tabs, in the “Exchange Rate 1 [currency] =”

RECORDING A 
DEPOSIT TO A 
VENDOR
 TIP 	 You can’t change a vendor’s currency after you’ve recorded your first transaction for that vendor. To 
switch to a different currency, you have to create a new vendor record that uses the new currency. The alternative 
is to calculate the bill’s values in your home currency based on the going exchange rate, and then enter the bill 
in QuickBooks with those converted values.
Recording a Deposit to a Vendor
Suppose a vendor requires you to pay a deposit before it will deliver a service or 
product. In QuickBooks, you can record the deposit payment so it shows up as a 
credit to that vendor. Then, when the bill arrives, you can apply that credit to the 
bill. Here’s what you do:
1.	 Write a check (page 202), enter a credit card charge (page 213), or use an­
other payment method (page 214) to pay the deposit. Choose the vendor’s 
name in the “Pay to the Order of,” “Purchased From,” or other corresponding 
name field, depending on the transaction you’re recording.
If you have an open purchase order for items from that vendor, QuickBooks 
displays a message box about it; click No because it’s too early to use the pur­
chase order—you aren’t purchasing the items yet.
2.	 In the Write Checks or Enter Credit Card Charges window, click the Expenses 
tab; in the first Account cell, choose your Accounts Payable account.
Choosing this account creates a credit for you with that vendor.
3.	 In the first Amount cell, enter the amount of the deposit.
When you click away from this Amount cell, the transaction amount listed in 
the top half of the window changes to the deposit amount you just entered.
4.	 In the Memo field, type a note to remind yourself that this transaction is 
for a vendor deposit.
That way, when it’s time to record the final bill, it’ll be easy to find this transaction.
5.	 Click Save & Close (or Save & New) to save the payment transaction.
You don’t have to do anything else until the final bill arrives.
6.	 When you receive the bill, enter it in QuickBooks as you would any other bill.
Fill in the Account fields with the expense accounts for the products or services 
you received (page 187) or, on the Items tab, fill in the Item fields with the items 
you’re putting a deposit on.
7.	 Apply the vendor credit to the bill as described on page 197.
The credit reduces the balance due.
8.	 Save the bill.

HANDLING 
REIMBURSABLE 
EXPENSES
That’s it! When it’s time to pay the bill, simply pay it using the new, lower balance 
(page 194).
 TIP 	 You can also use this technique to edit a check or credit card charge so you can apply it to a bill that you 
forgot you’d already entered. Simply edit the check or credit card charge and change the account to Accounts 
Payable. Then use the credit to pay all or a portion of the bill.
Handling Reimbursable Expenses
Reimbursable expenses are costs you incur that a customer subsequently pays. 
Products you purchase specifically for a customer or a subcontractor you hire to work 
on a customer’s job are costs you pass on to the customer. For example, travel costs 
are a common type of reimbursable expense, and you’ve probably seen telephone 
and photocopy charges on your attorney’s statements.
There are two ways to track reimbursable expenses, and QuickBooks can handle 
them both:
• As income. With this method, QuickBooks posts the expenses on a bill you 
record to the expense account you specify. When you invoice your customer, 
QuickBooks posts the reimbursement as income in a separate income account. 
Your income is higher this way, but it’s offset by higher expenses. This approach 
is popular because it lets you compare income from reimbursable expenses with 
the reimbursable expenses themselves to make sure they match. The box on 
page 193 describes the income accounts you need for tracking reimbursable 
expenses this way.
• As expenses. Tracking reimbursements as expenses doesn’t change the way 
QuickBooks handles bills—expenses still post to the expense accounts you 
specify. But, when your customer pays you for the reimbursable expenses, Quick­
Books posts those reimbursements right back to the expense account, so the 
expense account balance looks as if you never incurred the expense in the first 
place. Because you use the same expense account to record both the expense 
and the reimbursement, you don’t have to do any special setup in QuickBooks.
Setting Up Reimbursements as Income
If you want to track reimbursable expenses as income, choose Edit→Preferences→Time 
& Expenses. Then, on the Company Preferences tab, turn on the “Track reimbursed 
expenses as income” checkbox. With this preference turned on, whenever you cre­
ate or edit an expense account (in the Add New Account or Edit Account window), 
QuickBooks adds a “Track reimbursed expenses in Income Acct.” checkbox and 
drop-down list to the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 9-4.

REIMBURSABLE 
EXPENSES
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Accounts for Reimbursable Expenses
QuickBooks won’t let you assign the same income account to 
more than one reimbursable expense account, so you have to 
create a separate income account (see Chapter 3) for each type 
of reimbursable expense.
To keep your chart of accounts neat, create a top-level income 
account called something like Reimbursed Expenses. Then 
create an income subaccount for each type of reimbursable 
expense. When you’re done, your income accounts will look 
something like this:
• 4100 Service Revenue
• 4200 Product Revenue
• 4900 Reimbursed Expenses - Income 
Subaccounts for account 4900:
• 4910 Reimbursed Telephone
• 4920 Reimbursed Postage
• 4930 Reimbursed Photocopies
• 4940 Reimbursed Travel
An alternative approach is to create Other Charge items for 
each type of reimbursable expense. By doing so, you can as-
sign those items to a single income account, and you can see 
the details of each reimbursable category by running a Sales 
By Item report (page 459).
FIGURE 9-4
To track a reimbursable 
expense as income, in the 
Add New Account or Edit 
Account window, turn on 
the “Track reimbursed 
expenses in Income Acct.” 
checkbox and then, in the 
drop-down list, choose 
the income account to use. 
If you’ve already created 
your expense accounts, 
you’ll have to edit each 
one that’s reimburs-
able (travel, telephone, 
equipment rental, and so 
on) and add the income 
account as shown here.
Once you’ve assigned an income account to all your reimbursable expenses, here’s 
what happens as you progress from paying bills to invoicing customers:
1.	 When you assign an expense or item on a bill as reimbursable to a customer, 
QuickBooks posts the money to the expense account you specified.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
194
PAYING YOUR 
BILLS
2.	 When you create an invoice for that customer, the program reminds you 
that you have reimbursable expenses or items.
3.	 When you add the reimbursable expenses or items to the customer’s invoice, 
they post to the income account you specified for that type of expense or 
item. (See the box on page 193 to learn more about creating income accounts 
for reimbursable expenses.)
Recording Reimbursable Expenses
As you enter bills (page 186) or make payments with checks or credit cards, you add 
designated expenses as reimbursable, as shown in Figure 9-5. When you choose 
a customer or job in the Customer:Job column, QuickBooks automatically adds a 
checkmark to the “Billable?” cell. Be sure to type a note in the Memo cell to identify 
the expense, because QuickBooks uses the text in that cell as the description of the 
reimbursable expense on your invoice.
 TIP 	 Sometimes you want to track expenses associated with a customer or job, but you don’t want to display 
all those individual expenses on invoices, like when you have a fixed-price contract. In that situation, click the 
“Billable?” cell for that expense to remove the checkmark.
FIGURE 9-5
The tables in the Enter 
Bills, Write Checks, and 
Enter Credit Card Charges 
windows all include 
columns to designate 
reimbursable expenses 
and the customers or 
jobs to which they apply. 
(You can click Splits in an 
account register to access 
these columns.)
Paying Your Bills
Entering bills in QuickBooks isn’t the same as paying bills. The bills you enter in your 
company file are a record of what you owe and when, but they do nothing to send 
money to your vendors. Pay Bills is the QuickBooks feature that actually pushes 
your money out the door. It lets you select the bills you want to pay; specify how 
much to pay on each one; and choose the payment method, account, and date. If 
you have credits or early payment discounts, you can include those, too. This sec­
tion covers all the details.

Chapter 9: Paying for Expenses
195
PAYING YOUR 
BILLS
 TIP 	 If you want to evaluate all your unpaid bills before you pay them, the Unpaid Bills Detail report displays 
the bills due up to the current date, grouped by vendor. To run it, choose Reports→Vendors & Payables→Unpaid 
Bills Detail or, at the top left of the Enter Bills window, click the Reports tab and then click the Unpaid Bills Detail 
icon. The window’s Reports tab offers several other vendor-related reports like Open Purchase Order Detail and 
Purchases By Vendor Detail.
Selecting Bills to Pay
You begin the payment process by choosing the bills you want to pay. Here are the 
steps:
1.	 Choose Vendors→Pay Bills (or click the Pay Bills icon on the Home Page).
QuickBooks opens the Pay Bills window and displays the bills due on or before 
the date in the window’s aptly named “Due on or before” box. As Figure 9-6 
shows, you can change which bills are displayed, view bill details, or apply 
credits and discounts.
FIGURE 9-6
In the Pay Bills window, 
you can easily spot early 
payment discounts by 
selecting “Show all bills” 
in the upper left. Then, in 
the Sort By box, choose 
Discount Date to sort by 
the discount date (or the 
due date, if the bill doesn’t 
have a discount date). 
When you click a bill in the 
table, QuickBooks shows 
available discounts and 
credits in the “Discount 
& Credit Information for 
Highlighted Bill” section 
(page 197 explains how to 
apply them).
If you want to review a 
bill before you pay it, click 
“Go to Bill”; the Enter Bills 
window opens so you 
can review or even revise 
the bill.
If you’ve turned on multiple currencies (page 656) and receive bills in differ­
ent currencies, in the A/P Account drop-down list at the top of the window, 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
196
PAYING YOUR 
BILLS
choose the corresponding Accounts Payable account for the currency in which 
you have to pay bills.
The window then displays the bills you’ve entered in that currency. (The bill 
amounts appear in the foreign currency.) Below the table, you see the total 
amount you have to pay in the foreign currency and your home currency.
 NOTE 	 If you pay bills in more than one currency, you have to make a separate pass through the Pay Bills 
window for each one. If you don’t use multiple currencies, the Pay Bills window doesn’t include the A/P Account 
or Exchange Rate fields.
2.	 Select the bills you want to pay by clicking their checkboxes in the first 
column of the window’s table.
Clicking the Select All Bills button below the table makes QuickBooks select all 
the bills displayed in the window’s table. (The button’s label changes to Clear 
Selections when at least one bill is selected.) Whether you select all the bills or 
just a few, QuickBooks fills in the Amt. To Pay cells for the selected bills with 
the total due on each bill.
 NOTE 	 If you select more than one bill from the same vendor, QuickBooks automatically combines those 
bills onto one check when you pay them.
To pay bills using two different payment methods (check and credit card, for 
example), make two passes through the Pay Bills window. On the first pass, 
choose all the bills that you pay with the first method and then, in the Payment 
section’s Method drop-down list, choose that method (such as Check). On the 
second pass, choose the bills you want to pay with the second method and 
then choose that method (such as Credit Card) in the Method drop-down list.
Now that you’ve selected the bills you want to pay, you can modify the amounts 
you pay or apply discounts and credits before you pay the bills. The following sec­
tions explain how.
Modifying Payment Amounts
Whether you select individual bills or all the bills in the Pay Bills window’s table, 
QuickBooks automatically fills in the selected bills’ Amt. To Pay cells with the total 
amounts that are due. Paying bills in full means you don’t have to worry about the 
next due date or paying late fees, but making partial payments can stretch limited 
resources to appease more of your unpaid vendors, as the box on page 197 explains.
To pay only part of a bill, in a bill’s Amt. To Pay cell, simply type how much you want 
to pay, and then click another cell to update the Amt. To Pay total.

Chapter 9: Paying for Expenses
197
PAYING YOUR 
BILLS
 TIP 	 If you keep your cash in an interest-bearing account until you need it, you’ll want to know how much 
money you need to transfer to your checking account to pay the bills. In the Pay Bills window, the number at the 
bottom of the Amt. Due column is the total of all the bills displayed, and the number at the bottom of the Amt. 
To Pay column is the total of all the bills you’ve selected. The two totals may differ if you’ve set up QuickBooks to 
automatically apply credits and discounts (see below), because any available credits and discounts reduce how 
much you owe. 
UP TO SPEED
When Cash Is Tight
If your cash accounts are dwindling, you may face some 
tough decisions about whom to pay and when. To help keep 
your business afloat until the hard times pass, here are a few 
strategies to consider:
• Pay the vendors whose products or services are essential 
to your business.
• Pay government obligations (taxes and payroll 
withholdings) first. In the Pay Bills window’s Sort By 
box, choose Vendor to make it easy to spot all your 
government bills.
• Make partial payments to all your vendors rather than full 
payments to some and no payments to others.
• If you want to pay small bills in full, in the Sort By box, 
choose Amount Due to sort your outstanding bills by 
dollar value.
Applying Discounts and Credits to Payments
Most companies like to use their discounts and credits as soon as possible. By far 
the easiest way to deal with discounts and credits you receive from vendors is to 
let QuickBooks handle them automatically.
Here’s how to delegate applying early payment discounts and available credits to 
QuickBooks:
1.	 Choose Edit→Preferences→Bills, and then click the Company Preferences 
tab.
Because these settings are on the Company Preferences tab, you have to be a 
QuickBooks administrator to change them. The settings you choose here apply 
to every person who logs into your company file.
2.	 To make QuickBooks apply available credits automatically, turn on the 
“Automatically use credits” checkbox.
With this setting turned on, QuickBooks automatically applies vendor credits to 
the corresponding vendor’s bills to reduce the amount you have to pay. If you’d 
rather choose when to apply credits, leave this checkbox turned off.
3.	 Turn on the “Automatically use discounts” checkbox and, in the Default 
Discount Account box, choose the account you use to track vendor discounts.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
198
PAYING YOUR 
BILLS
If you haven’t set up an account for vendor discounts, in the Default Discount 
Account drop-down list, choose <Add New>, and then create a new account 
(page 56) called something like Vendor Discounts.
 NOTE 	 Whether you create an income account or an expense account for vendor discounts is neither an ac­
counting rule nor a QuickBooks requirement, but a matter of how you view vendor discounts. If you think of them 
as expenses you’ve saved by paying early, create an expense account. If you view them as money you’ve made, 
create an income account instead. Either way, discounts you receive from vendors are different from discounts 
you extend to your customers. So, in the Default Discount Account box, choose an account specifically for vendor 
discounts, not your customer discount account.
As you’d expect, turning on these checkboxes tells QuickBooks to apply early pay­
ment discounts and available credits to bills without further instructions from you. 
The program uses your payment terms to figure out the early payment discounts 
you’ve earned, and it applies them and all available credits to their corresponding 
bills. Whether these checkboxes are on or off, you can still control the discounts 
and credits QuickBooks applies to your bills, as you’ll learn shortly. For example, 
you might want to delay a large credit until the following year in order to increase 
your expenses in the current year and thereby decrease this year’s taxable income.
APPLYING DISCOUNTS MANUALLY
If you want to apply discounts by hand or change a discount that QuickBooks added, 
here’s what to do:
1.	 On the Home Page, click the Pay Bills icon or choose Vendors→Pay Bills.
2.	 In the Pay Bills window’s table, turn on the checkmark cell (in the first col­
umn) for the bill whose discount you want to edit.
In the window’s “Discount & Credit Information for Highlighted Bill” section, 
QuickBooks shows the discount and credits that are available for the selected 
bill. More importantly, the program activates the Set Discount and Set Cred­
its buttons so you can click them to apply discounts and credits. (If the bill’s 
checkmark cell is turned off, QuickBooks shows the suggested discount and 
available credits, but the Set Discount and Set Credits buttons are dimmed.)
 TIP 	 When you’re applying discounts manually, look for dates in the Disc. Date column that are in the future. 
Those bills qualify for early payment discounts.
3.	 To apply or modify a discount to the selected bill, click Set Discount.
QuickBooks opens the “Discount and Credits” dialog box to the Discount tab 
(Figure 9-7). If you’ve turned on multiple currencies, the currency you set for the 
vendor appears to the left of the Suggested Discount label and in the “Amount 
of Discount” box.

Chapter 9: Paying for Expenses
199
PAYING YOUR 
BILLS
FIGURE 9-7
In the “Discount and Credits” dialog 
box, QuickBooks automatically selects 
the Discount tab and displays your 
payment terms, the discount date, 
and the amount of discount you 
deserve.
If the suggested discount is worth an 
early separation from your money, 
click Done to deduct the discount from 
your bill. Otherwise, click Cancel.
If you also want to work on credits 
(page 200), then when you’re done 
modifying the discount, click the 
Credits tab.
4.	 In the “Amount of Discount” box, QuickBooks fills in the suggested discount. 
To apply a different discount, type the new value.
Many companies try to save money by taking early payment discounts when 
they haven’t actually paid early. Some companies apply discounts regardless 
of what their payment terms are, and many vendors honor these undeserved 
discounts in the name of goodwill.
5.	 In the Discount Account drop-down list, choose the account you use to 
track vendor discounts.
If you use an income account, discounts increase the balance of the income ac­
count. If you use an expense account, discounts reduce how much you spend 
on expenses.
 TIP 	 If you want to track discounts on inventory separately from other discounts you receive, create a cost of 
goods sold account specifically for inventory discounts. For example, if QuickBooks created account 5000 for Cost 
of Goods Sold, you can create two subaccounts: 5005 for Cost of Inventory Sold and 5010 for Inventory Discounts. 
In your financial reports, the two subaccounts show your original cost and the discounts you receive. Account 
5000 adds the two subaccounts together to show your net cost of goods sold.

6.	 If you track classes, choose a class for the discount.
Typically, you’ll choose the same class for the discount that you used for the 
original expense.
7.	 Click Done.
QuickBooks closes the “Discount and Credits” dialog box. Back in the Pay Bills 
window, the program adds the discount you entered in the bill’s Disc. Used cell 
and recalculates the value in the Amt. To Pay cell by subtracting the discount 
amount from the amount due.
APPLYING CREDITS MANUALLY
When you select a bill in the Pay Bills window, the “Discount & Credit Information 
for Highlighted Bill” section shows the credits that are available for that bill. If the 
“Discount and Credits” dialog box is already open because you’ve applied a discount, 
just click the Credits tab and then perform step 4 of the list below. Otherwise, here’s 
how to apply available credits to a bill or remove credits that QuickBooks applied 
for you:
1.	 On the Home Page, click the Pay Bills icon or choose Vendors→Pay Bills.
2.	 In the Pay Bills window’s table, select a bill by turning on its checkmark cell.
In the window’s “Discount & Credit Information for Highlighted Bill” section, 
QuickBooks shows the credits available for that vendor, if any, and activates 
the Set Credits button.
3.	 To apply a credit to the selected bill, click Set Credits.
QuickBooks opens the “Discount and Credits” dialog box and displays the 
Credits tab, shown in Figure 9-8. Credits that are already applied to the bill 
have checkmarks next to them.
4.	 Turn on the checkmark cell for each credit you want to apply. If you want to 
use a credit later, turn off its checkmark cell. Then click Done.
QuickBooks closes the dialog box and applies the credits.
Setting the Payment Method and Account
After you’ve selected the bills you want to pay and applied any discounts and credits, 
you still have to tell QuickBooks how and when you want to pay those bills. These 
payment settings at the very bottom of the Pay Bills window are the last ones you 
have to adjust before paying your vendors:
• Date. QuickBooks fills in the current date automatically. To predate or postdate 
your payments, choose a different date here. (Page 650 explains how to get 
QuickBooks to date checks using the day you print them.)

electronic payment via the vendor’s website, or another non-QuickBooks bill-
payment service, choose Check.) If you pick Check, you have one other choice 
to make here:
—
— If you print your checks from QuickBooks, choose the To be printed option, 
and the program automatically adds the bills you selected to its queue of 
checks to be printed. (You’ll learn about printing these checks on page 211.)
—
— If you write checks by hand, choose the Assign check number option. That 
way, you can assign check numbers when you click the Pay Selected Bills 
button (explained in a moment).
• Account. If you specified a default account for the Pay Bills window to use (page 
640), QuickBooks automatically selects that account here. To use a different 
one, in this drop-down list, choose the account you use to pay bills, such as a

Paying Selected Bills
When you’re done setting up bills to pay, it’s time to pay them. Here are the steps:
1.	 Click the Pay Bills window’s Pay Selected Bills button.
If you write paper checks for your bills and chose the “Assign check number” 
option, QuickBooks opens the Assign Check Numbers dialog box. If you use 
any other payment method, jump to step 3.
2.	 In the Assign Check Numbers dialog box, if you want to start with the next 
unused check number, choose the “Let QuickBooks assign check numbers” 
option, and then click OK.
If you instead want to specify the check numbers for each check you write (to 
match the paper checks you’ve already written, for example), choose the “Let 
me assign the check numbers below” option. Enter the check numbers (or type 
a code like EFT for electronic funds transfers—see page 204) in the Check No. 
cells, and then click OK.
3.	 In the Payment Summary dialog box, click the button for the action you 
want to take next.
This dialog box shows the payments you’ve made and adds those payments 
to the appropriate checking or credit card account register. All you have to do 
is click the appropriate button:
—
— If you write paper checks, click Done. Then write the checks and mail them, 
as described in the next section.
—
— If you chose the “To be printed” option to print checks from QuickBooks, 
click Print Checks and see page 211 for details. Or, if you aren’t ready to 
print checks just yet, click Done.
—
— To create another batch of bill payments (for example, to pay bills using 
another method), click Pay More Bills.
 NOTE 	 The next time you open the Enter Bills window, you’ll see a PAID stamp on bills you’ve paid.
Writing Checks Without Entering Bills
You might enter bills in QuickBooks for the majority of your vendor transactions so 
you can keep track of early payment discounts or when bills are due. But you’re still 
likely to write a quick check from time to time to pay for an expense immediately. 
For example, when the person who plows your parking lot knocks on the door and 
asks for payment, he won’t want to wait while you step through the bill-entering 
and bill-paying process in QuickBooks—he just wants his $100. And if you write 
only a couple of checks a month, there’s nothing wrong with writing checks to pay 
vendors without entering a bill in QuickBooks.

Chapter 9: Paying for Expenses

WRITING 
CHECKS 
WITHOUT 
ENTERING

When you’re new to QuickBooks and want some guidance, use the Write Checks 
window to make sure you enter all the required info. Once you’re more experienced, 
you can record checks directly in QuickBooks’ checking account register. This sec­
tion describes how to do both.
Using the Write Checks Window
The Write Checks window is like a trimmed-down version of the Enter Bills window. 
Because you’re paying immediately, there’s no need for fields such as Bill Due or 
Terms. For a payment without a bill, you have to provide information about the ex­
penses or items you’re paying for, which is why the Write Checks window includes 
the Expenses and Items tabs. QuickBooks fills in a few fields for you, and the rest 
are like the ones you’ve met already in the Enter Bills window (page 186).
 NOTE 	 Don’t use the Write Checks (or Enter Bills) window to write checks to pay sales tax, payroll, payroll 
taxes, or other payroll liabilities. Instead, see page 555 to learn how to pay sales tax, and Chapter 15 for info about 
payroll transactions.
To write a check in the Write Checks window, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the Write Checks window by pressing Ctrl+W, choosing Banking→Write 
Checks, or clicking the Write Checks icon in the Home Page’s Banking sec­
tion.
As you can see in Figure 9-9, QuickBooks tries to flatten the learning curve by 
making the upper part of the window look like a paper check. If you use multiple 
currencies, QuickBooks lists the currency for your checking account in the Bank 
Account box, the currency for the vendor on the right side of the “Pay to the 
Order of” box, and the currency for the check to the left of the check amount.
If you set up bank account preferences (page 640), such as which bank account 
to use when you open the Write Checks window, QuickBooks automatically 
chooses that account for you.
2.	 If you want to print the check, at the top of the window, make sure the Print 
Later checkbox is turned on, and then skip to step 4.
When this checkbox is on, the words “To Print” appear to the right of the No. la­
bel, and QuickBooks adds the check to a print queue. When you print the checks 
in the queue (page 211), QuickBooks replaces “To Print” with check numbers.
 NOTE 	 If you don’t use multiple currencies, the Pay Online checkbox appears below the Print Later checkbox. 
Turn on the Pay Online checkbox to send this payment electronically (page 615).

Choosing a name in the 
“Pay to the Order of” 
field fills in the Address 
box, which is perfect for 
printing checks for mailing 
in window envelopes. Even 
though the company name 
appears in the “Pay to the

also displays the company 
name in the Address box 
to show you what it prints 
on checks.
If you include account 
numbers in your vendor 
records, QuickBooks adds 
the account number to the 
Memo field. 
3.	 If you’re writing checks by hand, turn off the Print Later checkbox and make 
sure the number in the No. box is correct.
When you turn off the Print Later checkbox, QuickBooks automatically fills in 
the No. box with the next check number for the selected bank account. If the 
number it fills in doesn’t match the check you’re writing by hand, type in the 
number from your paper check. If you type a check number that’s already been 
used, QuickBooks warns you about the duplicate number when you try to save 
the check. In the warning message box, click Cancel, and then, in the Write 
Checks window, edit the value in the No. field.
 TIP 	 If you suspect that there’s more than one check number awry, open the checking account register 
(page 374) to review multiple checks at once. To renumber a check in the register window, double-click the check 
transaction’s Number cell, type the new number, and then press Enter to save the change. As long as you keep 
editing check numbers until all the duplicates are gone, it’s OK to save a duplicate check number.

when you set up the vendor, you’ll see “Print As: [name]” above the “Pay to 
the Order of” field.
5.	 Add entries to the Expenses and Items tabs for the things the check is pay­
ing for, just like you do when you enter a bill (page 187).
QuickBooks calculates the check amount as you add entries on these tabs. If 
you fill in the check amount and then start adding expenses and items, you’ll 
know that the check total and the posted amounts match when no unallocated 
dollars remain. If you mangle the entries on either tab, you can start over by 
clicking the Clear Splits button at the top of the window.
6.	 Click Save & Close to record the check.
To write another check, click Save & New. To throw away any values in the 
window and start over, click Clear.
Adding Checks to an Account Register
In QuickBooks, entering checks in a bank account register is fast, easy, and—for 
keyboard aficionados—addictive. By combining typing and keyboard shortcuts, such 
as tabbing from cell to cell, you can make short work of entering checks. Here’s how 
to create checks in a register window:
1.	 Press Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window, and then double-click 
your bank account.
You can also open the register by clicking Check Register in the Home Page’s 
Banking section; next, in the Use Register dialog box, select the checking ac­
count, and then click OK. Either way, QuickBooks opens the account register 
window and positions the cursor in the Date cell of the first blank transaction.
2.	 To adjust the check’s date by a few days, press the plus key (+) or minus key 
(–) until the date is what you want.
See Appendix C (available from this book’s Missing CD page at www.missing­
manuals.com/cds) for more date-related keyboard shortcuts.
3.	 Press Tab to move to the Number cell.
QuickBooks automatically fills in the next check number for that bank account. If 
the number doesn’t match the paper check you want to write, press + or – until 
the number is correct or simply type the new number. (Pages 214–216 explain 
how to fill in the Number cell if you make a payment with a debit card, ATM 
card, electronic transaction, or other method.)

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
206
PRODUCING 
CHECKS
4.	 Press Tab to move to the Payee cell, and then start typing the name of the 
payee.
QuickBooks scans the lists of names in your company file and selects the first 
one that matches all the letters you’ve typed so far. As soon as it selects the 
one you want, press Tab to move to the Payment cell.
5.	 In the Payment cell, type the amount of the check.
If you previously recorded a check for that vendor, QuickBooks fills in this cell 
with the amount from the previous check. To use a different amount, simply 
type the new value.
6.	 Click the Account cell.
If the payee is a vendor with more than one pre-fill account assigned to it (page 
85), QuickBooks adds “-split-” to the Account cell. In that case, click Splits below 
the table to open the Splits panel (see Figure 9-10) so you can enter amounts 
for the accounts. You can also use the Splits panel if your check covers more 
than one type of expense and you want to allocate the payment among several 
accounts. For each allocation, specify the account, amount, memo, customer, 
and class (if you track classes), and then click Close.
7.	 If the check applies to only one expense account, in the Account drop-down 
list, choose the appropriate account.
You can also choose an account by typing the account’s number or the first 
few letters of its name. As you type, QuickBooks selects the first account that 
matches what you’ve typed. When the selected account is correct, press Tab 
to move to the Memo cell.
8.	 To add a description of the check, in the Memo cell, type your notes. 
9.	 When you’ve filled in all the fields you need, click Record to save the check.
To add more checks to the register, lather, rinse, repeat.
Producing Checks
When you choose Check in the Pay Bills window’s Method field, your checking 
account register shows check transactions, but you still have to generate physical 
checks to send to your vendors. For companies that produce lots of checks, printing 
them in QuickBooks can prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. But for a sole proprietorship 
that generates only a few checks each month, writing them by hand is easy enough. 
As this section explains, QuickBooks accepts either approach with equal aplomb.

Writing Checks by Hand
Handwriting checks doesn’t require any work in QuickBooks, but you still have to 
keep your company file in sync with your paper checks. Whether you’re writing 
checks for bills you’ve paid in QuickBooks or scratching out a spur-of-the-moment 
check to pay for the pizza you had delivered, you want to make sure that the check 
numbers in your bank account register match your paper checks.
If you’ve already recorded your check transactions in QuickBooks by paying bills 
(page 194) or entering a check transaction in your checking account register window 
for an immediate payment (page 205), synchronizing check numbers is as easy as 
writing the paper checks in the same order as you entered them in QuickBooks. First, 
open the checking account register window. You’ve got a few ways to do this: You 
can press Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window and then either double-click 
the checking account’s row or right-click it and choose Use Register. Alternatively, 
in the Home Page’s Banking panel, click Check Register; next, in the Use Register 
dialog box, select your checking account and then click OK. 
Once the register window is open, you can use the bill payments and check transac­
tions to guide your paper check writing, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 NOTE 	 If the next check number in QuickBooks isn’t the one on your next paper check, figure out why they 
don’t match. The answer might be as simple as a voided check that you forgot to enter in QuickBooks or a check 
you wrote earlier that was out of sequence. But if someone is walking off with blank checks, you need to take action.
Until you find the reason for the mismatched check number, editing the check numbers that QuickBooks assigns 
in the checking account register is the easiest way to get checks into the mail. In the register window, simply 
double-click an incorrect check number, and then type the number that’s on your paper check.

Setting Up QuickBooks to Print Checks
If you have scads of checks to generate, printing on preprinted computer checks is 
well worth the small amount of setup you have to do. And if you dedicate a printer 
to check printing and keep it stocked with checks, setup is truly a one-time event.
 TIP 	 Lock up your preprinted checks and any printer stocked with them. Otherwise, you might discover checks 
missing, which can lead to money disappearing from your bank account.
The first step is telling QuickBooks which printer to print to and the type of checks 
you use. (The program remembers these settings, so you need to go through this 
process just once.) After you’ve specified your check-printing settings, QuickBooks 
fills them in automatically in the Print dialog box, though you can always change 
those options before you print.
Here’s how you set QuickBooks up to print checks:
1.	 Open the “Printer setup” dialog box by choosing File→Printer Setup.
The dialog box’s Form Name drop-down list includes all the forms you can print 
in QuickBooks, so you can choose different print settings for each one.
2.	 In the Form Name drop-down list, select Check/PayCheck.
When you select this option, the Check Style section appears in the bottom of 
the dialog box; step 4 describes what to choose there.

CHECKS
3.	 In the “Printer name” drop-down list, choose the printer you want to use.
If you choose a printer brand that QuickBooks recognizes (there are only a 
few it doesn’t), the program automatically fills in the “Printer type” box. If you 
use a very old or very odd printer, you’ll have to manually choose the type of 
printer. “Page-oriented (Single sheets)” refers to printers that feed one sheet at 
a time. Choose Continuous (Perforated Edge) if the printer feeds a roll of paper.
 NOTE 	 If you print to checks on continuous-feed paper, properly aligning the paper in the printer is critical. 
You can save time and a lot of wasted checks by aligning the paper before you print batches of checks, as described 
on page 310.
4.	 In the Check Style section, choose the option that represents the type of 
check you purchased. (The box on page 210 explains where you can buy 
checks.)
The “Printer setup” dialog box displays examples of each check style it can deal 
with, making it easy to choose the right one, as shown in Figure 9-12. Voucher 
checks print one to a page, so they’re by far the easiest to use. However, if you 
use standard or wallet checks to save paper, see the box on page 212 to learn 
how to tell QuickBooks how you want it to handle partial pages of checks.
FIGURE 9-12

represents one-page forms 
that include both a check 
and a detachable stub 
for payroll or check info. 
The Standard option sets 
QuickBooks up to print 
checks that fit in a #10 
business envelope; they 
typically come three to a 
page. Wallet checks are 
narrower than standard 
business checks and have 
a perforation on the left 
for tearing off the check, 
leaving a stub containing 
check information that you 
can file.

5.	 If the company you buy checks from wants too much money to print your 
company info and logo on the checks, turn on the “Print company name and 
address” and “Use logo” checkboxes.
Turning on the “Print company name and address” checkbox tells QuickBooks 
to print the company name and address you filled in when you created your 
company file (page 11). If you turn on the “Use logo” checkbox, the program 
opens the Logo dialog box. Click File and, in the Open Logo File dialog box, 
select the file containing your logo, and then click Open. (QuickBooks can handle 
BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF formats.) Back in the Logo dialog box, click OK.
If your company info and logo are preprinted on your checks, leave these 
checkboxes turned off.
6.	 If you have an image of your signature saved on your computer, you can 
print it on your checks by turning on the Print Signature Image checkbox.
When you turn on this checkbox, QuickBooks opens the Signature dialog box. 
Click File and then, in the Open Logo File dialog box, locate and double-click 
the file containing your signature. (One way to create a graphic file of your 
signature is by signing a piece of paper and then scanning it.)
7.	 Click OK to save your check-printing settings.
The next section tells you how to actually print checks.
 NOTE 	 If you want to change the fonts on the checks you print, click the “Printer setup” dialog box’s Fonts 
tab. There you can change the font for the entire check form by clicking Font, or designate a special font for the 
company name and address by clicking Address Font.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Buying Preprinted Checks
Do I have to order checks from Intuit?
The short answer is no, but there are compelling reasons 
to go with Intuit’s checks. The company sells competitively 
priced preprinted checks that work with QuickBooks. Also, the 
program keeps track of the checks you’ve used and tells you 
when to order more. It then automatically sends the correct 
bank account number with your order.
To order Intuit checks, at the top of the Write Checks window, 
click Order Checks. If you haven’t ordered from Intuit before, 
select the “I’m ordering from Intuit for the first time” option. 
QuickBooks turns on the checkbox to use your company and 
bank account information to fill out your order form. Click 
Order Now to open the Checks web page and set up your order.
You can also purchase checks from your bank or a business-
form company (such as Clarke American or Deluxe). The checks 
have to be preprinted with your bank account number, bank 
routing number, and the check number, because QuickBooks 
prints only the payment information, such as date, payee, and 
amount. So if you order checks from a company other than 
Intuit, be sure to tell them that you use QuickBooks, since 
the checks need to have fields positioned to match where 
QuickBooks prints data.

Printing Checks
In the Pay Bills window’s Method section, choosing the “To be printed” option tells 
QuickBooks to add the checks you’ve selected for payment to a print queue when 
you click the Pay Selected Bills button. You can also tell QuickBooks to add a check 
to a print queue by turning on the Print Later checkbox at the top of the Write 
Checks window.
After you confirm that your preprinted checks are in the printer and that the checks 
are aligned properly, you can print queued-up checks by following these steps:
1.	 If you’re at the end of the Pay Bills process and the Payment Summary 
dialog box is open, click Print Checks. Otherwise, choose File→Print 
Forms→Checks.
QuickBooks opens the “Select Checks to Print” dialog box and selects all the 
unprinted checks, as shown in Figure 9-13.
FIGURE 9-13
The first time you print 
checks, QuickBooks sets 
the First Check Number 
box to 1. If necessary, 
change this number to 
match the one on the 
first check loaded in your 
printer.
2.	 If you don’t want to print a particular check that’s listed, turn off its check­
box. When only the checks you want to print are selected, click OK.
QuickBooks opens the Print Checks dialog box, which looks much like the 
“Printer setup” dialog box for checks (Figure 9-12).
3.	 If you’re printing standard or wallet checks and the first page of checks in 
your printer is a partial page, in the “Number of checks on first page” box, 
type how many checks there are.
You won’t see this box if you’re printing to voucher checks because they print 
one to a page. But for standard or wallet checks, this box lets you use leftover 
checks from previous print runs (assuming you have a page-oriented printer). 
Type the number of leftover checks on the partial page, and then insert that 
page into your printer’s envelope feeder. After QuickBooks prints checks to 
that page, it will begin feeding full sheets of checks from the paper tray. See 
the box on page 212 for the full scoop on telling QuickBooks how you want it 
to handle partial pages of checks.

4.	 Click Print.
Because of the problems that can happen during printing (paper jams, low 
toner, or an unfortunate coffee spill), QuickBooks opens the “Print Checks – 
Confirmation” dialog box after it prints checks.
5.	 If there was a problem, in the “Print Checks – Confirmation” dialog box, 
click the Reprint cell for each check that didn’t print correctly.
If the whole batch is a loss, click Select All.
6.	 Click OK to reprint the misprinted checks.
In addition to printing the checks, QuickBooks also removes the words “To Print” 
from those checks in your checking account register, replacing them with the 
check numbers it used.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Using Leftover Checks
If you use voucher checks, you don’t have to worry about 
leftovers, because each check prints on its own page. However, 
when you print standard or wallet checks to single sheets of pa-
per (which usually have three checks on each sheet), you might 
print only one or two of the checks on the last sheet, leaving 
a leftover or two. Happily, QuickBooks includes a setting that 
lets you print on those orphaned checks. Here are the steps:
1.	 Choose File→Printer Setup, and then choose Check/
PayCheck in the Form Name drop-down list.
2.	 Click the Partial Page tab.
3.	 Choose the option (Side, Center, or Portrait) that 
corresponds to how your printer feeds envelopes, and 
then click OK to save the setting.
The Side and Portrait options are the most common methods. 
If you select Side, you insert the partial page of checks into 
the envelope feeder sideways, with the top of the first check 
aligned with the left side of the envelope feeder. With the 
Portrait option, you feed the top of the first check straight 
into the envelope feeder. (Whether you insert pages face up or 
down depends on the type of printer you have. Print a sample 
page of checks to determine which direction you have to feed 
pages, and then tape a note to the printer with instructions 
like “Print side down, top edge in first” so you don’t misprint 
any future pages.)
Before you start printing, feed the page with orphaned checks 
into your printer’s envelope feeder. That way, QuickBooks prints 
to those orphaned checks before printing to the full pages of 
checks in the paper tray.
Paying Using Other Payment Methods
These days, you can choose from a plethora of payment methods besides checks, 
such as credit cards, debit cards, online services like PayPal, electronic transactions, 
and even cold cash. Fortunately, recording these transactions in QuickBooks is a lot 
like recording checks. This section describes the other payment methods you can 
use and how they differ from writing checks.

PAYING 
USING OTHER 
PAYMENT 
METHODS
Paying with Credit Cards
When you make credit card purchases, the easiest way to record those charges in 
your company file is by signing up for online banking with your financial institution 
(page 610), setting up bank feeds (page 611), and then downloading the transactions 
(page 617). But you can also enter credit charges manually.
 TIP 	 Regardless of whether you download charges, entering charges manually is a great way to catch errone­
ous or fraudulent charges that appear on your statement. For example, after entering your charges manually, 
you can download the charges from your credit card company. If you see additional charges that don’t match the 
ones you entered, either you forgot a charge or there’s an error in your account.
Recording credit card charges is almost the same as writing checks except that, 
instead of the Write Checks window, you use the Enter Credit Card Charges window, 
shown in Figure 9-14. Behind the scenes, QuickBooks adds the credit card charge to 
your credit card account, which is a current liability account. That means the balance 
in the account increases because you owe more money. (When you write a check 
out of your checking account, the account’s balance decreases because you have 
less money in that asset account.)

vendors, type their names 
in the Memo field here. 
You can leave the Ref. No. 
field blank or enter your 
receipt number there. Allo-
cating a charge to multiple 
accounts or to a customer 
works the same as for bills 
(page 187).
To open the Enter Credit Card Charges window, choose Banking→Enter Credit Card 
Charges or, in the Home Page’s Banking section, click Enter Credit Card Charges. 
You can also enter charges directly in the credit card account register, just as you 
do with checks.
 NOTE 	 To enter a refund for a credit card charge, near the top of the Enter Credit Card Charges window, 
choose the Refund/Credit option, and then fill in the window’s fields with info about the refund you received.

PAYING 
USING OTHER 
PAYMENT 
METHODS
Paying with a Debit Card
Paying with a debit card is like writing a check, because the transaction removes 
money from your checking account. For that reason, you use the Write Checks 
window to record debit card transactions. In fact, you can also use the Write Checks 
window to record electronic funds transfers. The only difference between these 
transactions and regular checks is what you enter in the window’s No. field.
Instead of putting a check number in this field, you can use a code to identify the type 
of payment. For example, enter DB for a debit card or EFT for electronic transactions 
like an online bill payment you make with your bank’s bill-pay service or directly 
through a vendor’s website. If you have several debit cards for your bank account, 
you may want to include the last four digits of the card number after the code so 
you can tell your transactions from your partner’s transactions.
Debit card transactions are different from credit card charges, which is why you 
don’t use the Enter Credit Card Charges window to record them. Debit card charges 
reduce the balance in your checking account, which is a current asset account (page 
57), whereas credit card charges increase the balance in your credit card account, 
which is a current liability account (page 57).
Paying with PayPal
Paying via PayPal is similar to paying with a debit card (described in the previous 
section), except that these payments remove money from your PayPal account, 
not your checking account. The Write Checks window works for recording PayPal 
expense payments with a few small changes. Here are the fields that work differently 
when you record PayPal payments:
• Bank Account. Your PayPal account is like a checking account: If you pay for 
expenses via PayPal, the payment decreases your PayPal account’s balance. 
Similarly, customer payments increase your PayPal account’s balance. For those 
reasons, you create a bank account (page 56) in QuickBooks to represent your 
PayPal account. Then, when you record a PayPal payment in the Write Checks 
window, simply choose the account you set up for PayPal in this drop-down list. 
That way, the check amount reduces your PayPal account’s balance.
• No. Instead of putting a check number in this field, you can use a code like PP 
to identify this as a PayPal payment, or simply leave it blank.
 TIP 	 PayPal’s idiosyncrasies can make tracking transactions difficult. For example, PayPal transactions might 
show up as pending for a few days before they clear. And PayPal reports don’t present the info you need to 
reconcile your account in the most helpful format. If your PayPal account sees a lot of action—both in terms of 
payments you make as well as customer deposits—a third-party program that downloads PayPal transactions 
into QuickBooks may be the answer. One of the most popular is SimplePort (www.simpleport.net).

Paying with Cash
Dashing out to buy an extension cord so you can present a pitch to a potential client? 
Chances are you’ll grab money from the petty cash drawer at your office. Petty cash 
is the common term for money spent on small purchases, typically less than $20.
Many companies keep a cash drawer at the office and dole out dollars for small, 
company-related purchases that employees make. But for the small business owner 
with a bank card, getting petty cash is as easy as withdrawing money from an ATM. 
Either way, petty cash is still company money, and that means you have to keep track 
of it and how it’s spent. The following sections explain how to do that.
RECORDING ATM WITHDRAWALS AND DEPOSITS TO PETTY CASH
Before you can pay for something with petty cash, you need to put some money into 
your petty cash drawer. In QuickBooks, adding money to your petty cash account 
mirrors the real-world transaction: You either write a check made out to Cash (or 
the trustworthy employee who’s cashing the check), or you withdraw money from 
an ATM. To write a check to withdraw cash for your petty cash account, simply use 
the Write Checks window (choose Banking→Write Checks) to record the transac­
tion. If you withdraw cash from an ATM, use the Transfer Funds window (choose 
Banking→Transfer Funds) instead.
You don’t have to use the Write Checks or Transfer Funds windows to record petty 
cash transactions. If you’re OK with creating transactions in an account register 
window, here are the steps for replenishing your petty cash with a check:
1.	 In the Chart of Accounts window (press Ctrl+A to open it), double-click your 
checking account to open its register window.
QuickBooks selects the date in the first blank transaction. Depending on the 
date preference you choose (page 650), the program fills in either the current 
date or the last date you entered in a transaction. If you added money to petty 
cash on a different day, choose the correct date.
2.	 If you’re withdrawing money from an ATM, in the Number cell, either type 
ATM or clear the value that’s there.
If you’re writing a check to get petty cash and QuickBooks fills in the Number 
cell with the correct check number, continue to the Payee cell. Otherwise, type 
the correct check number in the cell.
3.	 Whether you’re writing a check or withdrawing money from an ATM, in the 
Payee cell, type a name such as Cash or Petty Cash.
If you made a check out to one of your employees, in the Payee cell’s drop-down 
list, choose that person’s name.
4.	 In the Payment cell, type the amount that you’re moving from the checking 
account to petty cash.

If you track classes in QuickBooks, this is one time to ignore the Class cell. 
You assign classes only when you record purchases made with petty cash (as 
explained in the next section).
5.	 In the Account cell, choose your petty cash account.
If you don’t already have a petty cash account in your chart of accounts, create 
the account now by choosing <Add New>, and then be sure to choose the Bank 
account type. That way, your petty cash account appears at the top of your 
balance sheet with your other savings and checking accounts.
6.	 Click Record to save the transaction.
That’s it!
 TIP 	 If you make a withdrawal from an ATM to get petty cash, use QuickBooks’ Transfer Money feature (page 
386) to record the transaction. In the Transfer Funds From box, choose your bank account; in the Transfer Funds 
To box, choose your petty cash account.
RECORDING PURCHASES MADE WITH PETTY CASH
As long as company cash sits in a petty cash drawer or your wallet, the petty cash 
account in QuickBooks keeps track of it. But when you spend some of the petty 
cash in your wallet or an employee brings in a sales receipt for purchases, you have 
to record what was bought. (The box on page 217 explains how to track petty cash 
if an employee wants cash before he’s made a purchase.)
The petty cash account’s register is as good a place as any to record these purchases. 
In the Chart of Accounts window, double-click the petty cash account to open its 
register window. Then, in a blank transaction, follow these guidelines to record your 
petty cash expenditures:
• Number. Although petty cash expenditures don’t use check numbers, Quick­
Books automatically puts the next check number in this cell. The easiest thing 
to do is ignore the number and move on to the Payee cell.
• Payee. You don’t have to enter anything here, and for many petty cash transac­
tions, entering a Payee would just clog your list of names, so leave this cell blank.
• Memo. Type the vendor’s name or details of the purchase here.
• Payment. Enter the amount that was spent.
• Account. Choose an account like Office Supplies to track the expense.
 TIP 	 To distribute the petty cash spent to several accounts, click Splits. In the table that appears, specify the 
account, amount, customer or job, class, and a memo for each split (page 207).
When you’re done, click Record.

Petty Cash Advances
Good management practices warn against dishing out petty 
cash without a receipt. But suppose an employee asks for cash 
in advance to purchase a new lava lamp for the conference 
room? There’s no receipt, but you really want the lava lamp 
to impress the CEO of a tie-dye company.
The solution in the real world is to write a paper IOU and place 
it in the petty cash drawer until the employee coughs up a 
receipt. In QuickBooks, record the advance as if the purchase 
were already complete. For example, create the transaction 
in the petty cash account register using entries like these:
• In the Payee cell, type the name of the vendor you’re 
purchasing from.
• In the Amount cell, type the amount of money you 
advanced to the employee. 
• In the Account cell, choose the account that corresponds 
to the expense, such as Office Supplies.
• In the Memo cell, type a note about the employee who 
received the advance, the IOU in the petty cash drawer, 
and what the advance is for.
When the employee comes back with a receipt, you can update 
the transaction’s Memo cell to show that the IOU has been 
repaid. If the employee brings change back, create a deposit 
to put that money back in the petty cash account using the 
same payee and account as the original withdrawal transaction.
Recording Vendor Refunds and Credits
Say you ordered 30 dozen lightweight polypropylene tank tops for your summer 
Death Valley marathon, but your vendor mistakenly silk-screened the logo on long-
sleeved cotton T-shirts heavy enough to survive a nuclear blast. If you raise a ruckus, 
the vendor may issue you a refund check or a credit. Either way, it’s easy to record 
the money you get back in QuickBooks.
Here’s how to deposit a vendor’s refund check or credit card refund:
1.	 Choose Banking→Make Deposits or, in the Home Page’s Banking panel, 
click Record Deposits.
2.	 If the “Payments to Deposit” window appears, turn on the checkmark cell 
for each payment you want to deposit along with the refund check, and then 
click OK to open the Make Deposits window.
The “Payments to Deposit” window opens only if you have other deposits to 
make.
3.	 In the Make Deposits window’s Deposit To drop-down list, choose the bank 
account where you’re going to deposit the refund.
If you selected other deposits in the “Payments to Deposit” window in the 
previous step, they appear in the Make Deposit window’s table.

refund check.
If the check isn’t from a vendor, you can choose a customer, employee, or other 
name instead.
5.	 In the From Account cell, choose the account associated with the refund.
For a refund for shirts you purchased, you might choose a cost of goods sold 
account that you use for products you buy specifically for customers. If the 
refund is for office supplies, choose the expense account for office supplies.
6.	 Fill in the other fields, and then click Save & Close.
Enter a note about the refund (in the Memo cell), the check number (if you re­
ceived a refund check), the payment method (to indicate whether you received 
a refund check or a credit card refund), and the amount of the refund.
If the vendor insists on issuing you a credit with its company instead of a refund 
check, here’s how to record that credit in QuickBooks:
1.	 Choose Vendors→Enter Bills or, in the Home Page’s Vendors panel, click 
Enter Bills.
QuickBooks opens the Enter Bills window as if you’re going to enter a bill.
2.	 Just below the window’s ribbon, choose the Credit option.
QuickBooks changes the window’s giant heading to “Credit” and the Amount 
Due label to Credit Amount. The other fields stay the same.
3.	 On the Expenses and Items tabs, fill in the cells with the items for which 
you received credit.
Enter positive numbers just as you did when you entered the original bill. Quick­
Books takes care of posting the credit amounts to your accounts. Your inventory 
account decreases due to the inventory items you returned, your cost of goods 
sold account decreases due to the non-inventory items you returned, and your 
expense accounts’ balances decrease due to expense credits. The total credit 
amount also reduces the balance in your Accounts Payable account.
4.	 Click Save & Close.
That’s all there is to it. See page 200 to learn how to apply a credit.
Running Expense-Related Reports
QuickBooks’ Vendors & Payables reports tell you how much you owe each vendor 
and when the payments are due. The reports in the program’s Purchases category, 
on the other hand, focus on how much you’ve bought from each vendor you work 
with. In addition, QuickBooks’ new Insights tab is a great way to examine your ex­
penses. This section tells you how to put several expense-related reports to work.

A/P Aging and Vendor Balance Reports
If your company is flush with cash and you pay bills as soon as they appear in the 
Pay Bills window, your A/P Aging reports and Vendor Balance reports will contain 
mostly zeroes. If you want an overview of how much you owe each vendor and how 
much is overdue, use one of the following reports listed under Reports→Vendors 
& Payables:
• A/P Aging Summary. This report shows all the vendors you owe money to and 
how old your balances are for each one. Double-click a value to see a report of 
the transactions that produced the amount owed.
• A/P Aging Detail. Run this report to see each unpaid bill sorted by its billing 
date and grouped into bills that are current, 1 to 30 days overdue, 31 to 60 days 
overdue, 61 to 90 days overdue, and more than 90 days late.
• Vendor Balance Detail. This report shows your bills and payments grouped 
by vendor.
 TIP 	 You can also see the details of a vendor’s balance in the Vendor Center: Select the vendor on the Vendor’s 
tab and then, on the right side of the window, click the Open Balance link.
• Unpaid Bills Detail. If you want to evaluate all your unpaid bills before you pay 
them, this report is helpful because it displays the bills due up to the current 
date, grouped by vendor. To include bills due in the future, in the report window’s 
Dates box, choose All. If you want to inspect a bill more closely, double-click 
anywhere in its row, and the Enter Bills window opens with the bill’s details. 
(You can also run this report from the Enter Bills window: Click the Reports tab

Reports about Purchases
Purchasing reports (Reports→Purchases) tell you how much you’ve spent by ven­
dor or item. And if you create purchase orders for items you buy, you can review all 
your open purchase orders. Here are a few of the purchasing reports you can use:
• Purchases by Vendor Summary. This report shows how much you’ve spent with 
each vendor during a given time period. For example, this report can help you 
figure out whether you should ask for better terms due to the volume of busi­
ness you do with a vendor, or perhaps if you should line up additional vendors 
in case one goes out of business. Double-click a vendor’s row in the report to 
run the Purchases by Vendor Detail report, which shows every transaction for 
that vendor.
• Purchases by Item Summary. This report shows the quantity and value of your 
purchases by item.
• Open Purchase Orders. As you’d expect, this report shows you all the purchase

CHAPTER
10
T
elling your customers how much they owe you and how soon they need to pay 
is an important step in bookkeeping. After all, if money isn’t flowing into your 
organization from outside sources, eventually you’ll close up shop and close 
your QuickBooks company file for the last time.
Although businesses use several different sales forms to bill customers, the invoice 
is the most popular, and, unsurprisingly, customer billing is often called invoicing. 
This chapter begins by explaining the differences between invoices, statements, 
and sales receipts—each of which is a way of billing customers in QuickBooks—and 
when each is most appropriate.
After that, you’ll learn how to fill in invoice forms in QuickBooks, whether you’re 
invoicing for services, products, or both. If you send invoices for the same items to 
many of your customers (and don’t use the program’s multiple currencies feature), 
QuickBooks’ batch invoice feature can help: You select the customers, add the items 
you want on the invoices, and the program creates all the invoices for you. If you 
track billable hours and reimbursable expenses with QuickBooks, you can also have 
the program chuck those charges into the invoices you create.
Finally, you’ll find out how to handle a few special billing situations, like creating 
invoices when products you sell are on backorder and how to handle products you 
sell on consignment. You’ll also learn how to create estimates for jobs and then use 
them to generate invoices as you perform the work. And, since you occasionally have 
to give money back to customers, you’ll learn how to assign a credit to a customer’s 
account, which you can then deduct from an existing invoice, refund by cutting a 
refund check, or apply to the customer’s next invoice.

CHOOSING THE 
RIGHT TYPE OF 
FORM
 NOTE 	 Chapter 11 continues the invoicing lesson by teaching you how to produce statements that show 
your customers’ account status. It also explains how to create sales receipts when customers pay you right away. 
And Chapter 12 explains how to get any kind of sales form into your customers’ hands, along with a few other 
timesaving techniques, like finding transactions and memorizing them for reuse.
Choosing the Right Type of Form
In QuickBooks, you can choose from three different sales forms to document what 
you sell, and each form has strengths and limitations. Invoices can handle any bill­
ing task you can think of, so they’re the best choice if you have any doubts about 
which one to use. Table 10-1 summarizes what each sales form can do. The sections 
that follow explain the forms’ capabilities in detail and give guidance on when to 
choose each one.

 NOTE 	 QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise editions include one more type of sales form: the sales order. 
In those editions, when you create a sales order for the products that a customer wants to buy, you can create 
an invoice for the items that are in stock and keep track of out-of-stock items that you’ll need to send to your 
customer when a new shipment arrives (see page 260).

Chapter 10: Invoicing
223
CHOOSING THE 
RIGHT TYPE OF 
FORM
Sales Receipts
The sales receipt is the simplest sales form that QuickBooks offers, and it’s also 
the shortest path between making a sale and having money in the bank (at least in 
QuickBooks). But this form is suitable only if your customers pay the full amount 
at the time of the sale—for example, in a retail store, restaurant, or beauty salon. 
However, you can also accumulate charges for time (page 167) and billable expenses 
(page 194), and then add them to a sales receipt. But for products you sell, sales 
receipts handle only payment in full.
When you create and save a sales receipt in QuickBooks, the program immediately 
posts the money you receive to the Undeposited Funds account or to the bank ac­
count you choose. As you’ll learn in this chapter and the next, invoices and statements 
take several steps to move from billing to bank deposits, so ease of depositing is 
one advantage of sales receipts over those other sales forms.
Sales receipts can handle sales tax, discounts, and subtotals—or any other item in 
your Item List. But when you operate a cash business, creating a sales receipt in 
QuickBooks for each newspaper and pack of gum your newsstand sells is not good 
use of your time. Instead, consider creating a sales receipt that summarizes a day’s 
or a week’s sales (page 362), using a customer named Cash Sales that you create 
specifically for that purpose.
Statements
Suppose you’re a lawyer and you spend 15 minutes here and 15 minutes there work­
ing on a client’s legal problem over the course of a month. Each time you do so, 
that’s another charge to the client’s account. In QuickBooks, each of those charges 
is called a statement charge. You can enter them individually (page 296) or, if you 
track time in QuickBooks, you can add your time to an invoice just as easily, as 
described on page 253.
Businesses often turn to statements when they charge the same amount each 
month, such as a fixed monthly fee for Internet service or full-time work as a con­
tract programmer. Although statements work for these fixed fees, you can also use 
memorized invoices (page 322) and QuickBooks’ batch invoice feature (page 243) 
to do the same thing just as easily.
Where statements really shine is in summarizing a customer’s account. Behind the 
scenes, a statement adds up all the transactions that affect the customer’s open 
balance over a period of time, which includes statement charges, payments, and 
invoices. The statement shows the customer’s previous balance, any payments that 
the customer has made, any invoices that she hasn’t paid, and any new charges on 
the account. From all that information, QuickBooks calculates the total and displays 
it on the statement, so you know how much money is outstanding and whether it’s 
overdue.

SALES 
FORMS AND 
ACCOUNTS
Invoices
If statements or sales receipts don’t work for your situation, don’t be afraid to use 
invoices. They accept any item you’ve created in your Item List (see Chapter 5) and 
they track what customers owe you.
Besides offering all the features listed in Table 10-1, an invoice is also the only type 
of QuickBooks sales form you can generate from an estimate (page 282). If you’re 
a general contractor and prepare a detailed estimate of the services and products 
for a job, you’ll save a huge chunk of time by turning that estimate into an invoice 
for billing. And if you have to refund some of your customer’s money, you can also 
turn an invoice into a credit memo (page 288).
Sales Forms and Accounts
An invoice or other sales form is the first step in the flow of money through your 
company, so now is a good time to look at how QuickBooks posts income and ex­
penses from your invoices to the accounts in your chart of accounts. Suppose your 
invoice has the entries shown in Figure 10-1. Table 10-2 shows how the amounts on 
that invoice post to accounts in your chart of accounts.
 NOTE 	 The lines on the invoice in Figure 10-1 don’t show all the movements between accounts listed in Table 
10-2. Behind the scenes, QuickBooks transfers money to your cost of goods sold and inventory accounts.

FORMS AND

FIGURE 10-1
If you’re still getting used 
to double-entry account-
ing, balancing the debit 
and credit amounts for an 
invoice is a brainteaser. 
For example, the items for 
services and products on 
the invoice shown here 
turn up as credits in your 
income accounts, as in 
Table 10-2. The discount 
reduces your income, so 
it’s a debit to the Sales 
Discounts income account. 
Although the debits and 
credits appear in different 
accounts, the total debit 
must equal the total credit.
Here’s why the amounts post the way they do:
• You sold $5,000 of services and $499.75 of products, which is income. The 
income values appear as credits to your Services Revenue and Product Revenue 
accounts to increase your income because you sold something. In this example, 
the discount is in an income account, so the discount is in the Debit column to 
reduce your income.
• The $37.48 of sales tax you collect is a credit to the Sales Tax Payable account.
• The shipping charge ($35.00) is a credit in your shipping income account to 
show what you charged for shipping.
• All those credits need to balance against a debit. Because your customer owes 
you money, the amount owed ($4,822.23) belongs in the Accounts Receivable 
account, indicated by the debit.
• You also sold some products from inventory. You credit the Inventory account 
with the cost of the products, $249.78, which decreases the Inventory account’s 
balance. You offset that credit with a debit for the same amount to the Cost of 
Goods Sold account, which is an income statement account.

CREATING 
INVOICES
Creating Invoices
Depending on which edition of QuickBooks you use, you have up to three features 
for creating invoices:
• Create Invoices can handle everything you throw at it: services, products, bill­
able time, and billable expenses. It’s available in QuickBooks Pro and higher.
• Create Batch Invoices (page 243) lets you select all the customers to which you 
want to send the same invoice (that is, the same items and the same amounts). 
If you send the same invoice to the same customers all the time, you can set 
up a billing group for those customers and, from then on, simply choose that 
group. After you create the invoice, you can print or email it to the customers 
in the group. This feature is available in QuickBooks Pro and higher, as long as 
you don’t use multiple currencies.
• Invoice for Time & Expenses, available only in QuickBooks Premier and Enter­
prise editions, can do everything that the Create Invoices feature can do, but 
it’s a real timesaver when you invoice for billable time and expenses. As you’ll 
learn on page 254, you specify a date range and QuickBooks shows you all the 
customers who have billable time and expenses during that period. When you 
choose a customer or job and tell the program to create an invoice, it opens the 
Create Invoices window, fills in the usual fields, and fills the invoice table with 
the customer’s billable time and expenses. Once you’re in the Create Invoices 
window, you can add any other items you want, like products you sold or dis­
counts you’re offering. This feature also lets you create batch invoices for time 
and expenses (page 257).
Invoices tell your customers everything they need to know about what they pur­
chased and what they owe you. If you created customers and jobs with settings 
such as payment terms, tax item, and sales rep (page 70), as soon as you choose a 
customer and job in the Create Invoices window’s Customer:Job field, QuickBooks 
fills in many of the fields for you.
Some invoice fields are more influential than others, but they all come in handy at 
some point. To understand the purpose of the fields on an invoice more easily, you 
can break the form up into three basic parts (see Figure 10-2). Because the invoices 
you create for product sales include a few more fields than the ones for services 
only, the following sections of this chapter use a product invoice to explain how to 
fill in each field you might run into on the invoices you create. These sections also 
tell you what to do if the information that QuickBooks fills in for you is incorrect.
 NOTE 	 If you charge customers based on the progress you’ve made on a project, invoices are a little more 
complicated, but you’ll learn how to handle this situation on page 284.

services sold, and other 
items, such as subtotals 
and discounts. Below the 
table, QuickBooks fills 
in the Tax field and the 
Customer Tax Code field 
with values from the 
customer’s record, but you 
can change any values that 
the program fills in. You 
can also add a message 
to the customer, choose 
your send method, or type 
a memo to store in your 
company file.
Creating an Invoice
In the sections that follow, you’ll find details about filling in all the fields on an invoice. 
(The box on page 229 describes some of the ways nonprofit invoicing differs from 
for-profit invoicing.) For now, here’s the basic procedure for creating and saving one 
or more invoices by using the Create Invoices feature:
1.	 Press Ctrl+I; in the Home Page’s Customers panel, click the Create Invoices 
icon; or, in the Customer Center toolbar, choose New Transactions→Invoices.
If you use QuickBooks Pro or if the preference for invoicing time and expenses 
isn’t turned on, then clicking the Home Page’s Create Invoices icon opens the 
Create Invoices window immediately.
If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise and you’ve turned on the preference 
to invoice for time and expenses (page 669), then the Home Page displays the 
Invoices icon instead of the Create Invoices icon. Clicking Invoices displays a 
shortcut menu with two entries: “Invoice for Time & Expenses” and Create In­
voices. Choose Create Invoices to create a regular invoice. Page 254 explains how 
to use the shortcut menu’s other entry to invoice for billable time and expenses.

228
CREATING 
INVOICES
2.	 In the Create Invoices window’s Customer:Job box, choose the customer 
or job associated with the invoice.
When you pick a customer or job, QuickBooks fills in many of the invoice fields 
with values from the customer’s record (see page 70) and the job’s record if 
you selected a job (page 80). For example, QuickBooks pulls the data for the 
Bill To address, Terms, and Rep fields from the customer’s or job’s record. And 
your Sales & Customers preferences (page 663) provide the values for the Via 
and F.O.B. fields. (FOB stands for “free on board,” which is the physical point 
where the customer becomes responsible for damage to or loss of the shipment.)
 NOTE 	 Depending on the QuickBooks edition you use and transactions you’ve entered, a few other windows 
may open when you choose a customer or job. If the customer or job you selected has an available estimate, 
the Available Estimates dialog box opens so you can fill in the invoice simply by selecting an estimate, and then 
clicking OK. If you use QuickBooks Premier and there’s an outstanding sales order (page 261), the Available Sales 
Order window appears so you can select the one you want to invoice.
In QuickBooks Premier, if the preference for invoicing time and expenses is turned on and the customer or job 
has associated time or expenses, the Billable Time/Costs dialog box opens with the “Select the outstanding 
billable time and costs to add to this invoice” option selected. If you don’t want to add the time and expenses 
to this invoice, select the option whose label begins with “Exclude,” and then click OK. (To learn about invoicing 
for time and expenses, see page 252.)
3.	 For each product or service you sold, in the line-item table, enter the info 
for the item, including its quantity and price (or rate).
If you want, you can also fill in the boxes below the line-item table, such as 
Customer Message and Memo. You’ll rarely need to change the sales tax rate 
associated with the customer, but you can if necessary.
4.	 Maintain your professional image by checking for spelling errors before 
you send the invoice.
To run QuickBooks’ spell-checker, at the top of the Create Invoices window, click 
the Formatting tab, and then click Spelling. (If you checked spelling when you 
created your customers and invoice items, then the main source of spelling errors 
will be any edits you’ve made to item descriptions.) If the spell-checker doesn’t 
work the way you want, then change your Spelling preferences (page 668).
5.	 To save the invoice you just created and close the Create Invoices window, 
click Save & Close.
If you’re unhappy with the choices you made in the current invoice, click Clear 
to start over with a fresh, blank invoice. If you have additional invoices to create, 
click Save & New to save the current invoice and begin another.

 NOTE 	 If you create or modify an invoice and then click the Print icon in the Create Invoices window’s Main 
tab, QuickBooks saves the invoice before printing it, which helps prevent financial hanky-panky.
ALTERNATE REALITIES
Invoicing for Nonprofits
For nonprofits, invoices can record the pledges, donations, 
grants, or other contributions you’ve been promised.
Invoicing for nonprofits differs from the for-profit world’s 
approach. First of all, many nonprofits don’t send invoices 
to donors. Nonprofits might send reminders to donors who 
haven’t sent in the pledged donations, but they don’t add 
finance charges to late payments.
Moreover, because some donors ask for specific types of 
reports, nonprofits often use several Accounts Receivable 
accounts to track money coming from grants, dues, pledges, 
and other sources. When you have multiple Accounts Receiv-
able accounts, the Create Invoices window includes an Account 
field so you can choose the appropriate Accounts Receivable 
account (just like when you work with multiple currencies, 
as described in the Note on page 233). For example, when 
you create an invoice for pledges, you’d choose the Pledges 
Receivable account.
To compensate for this additional field, QuickBooks includes 
a handy feature when you use multiple Accounts Receivable 
accounts: It remembers the last invoice number used for each 
AR account in your QuickBooks chart of accounts, so you can 
create unique invoice numbering schemes for each of them. 
For example, if you create an invoice for the Pledges Receivable 
account and set the Invoice # field to “PL-100,” QuickBooks 
automatically assigns invoice number “PL-101” to the next 
invoice you create for that account.
Filling in Invoice Header Fields
If you fill in all the fields in your customer and job records (see Chapter 4), QuickBooks 
takes care of filling in most of the fields in the header section of invoices. Here’s what 
the header fields do and where QuickBooks gets the values it fills in automatically.
CHOOSING THE CUSTOMER OR JOB
The selection you make in the Customer:Job field (shown in Figure 10-3) is your 
most important choice on any invoice. In addition to billing the correct customer 
for your work, QuickBooks uses the settings from the customer’s or job’s record to 
fill in many of the invoice’s fields.
 NOTE 	 If you’ve turned on the preference for multiple currencies, the last column in the Customer:Job drop-
down list shows the customer’s currency (as shown in Figure 10-3).

If you work on different 
jobs for a customer, click 
the name of the job, which 
is indented under the cus-
tomer’s name. If your work 
for a customer doesn’t 
relate to jobs, just click the 
customer’s name. 
The column to the right 
of the customer and 
job names provides 
another way to differenti-
ate customers and jobs: It 
displays “Customer:Job” 
for a customer entry, and 
“Job” for a job entry.
Once you select a customer or job, the panel on the right side of the Create Invoices 
window shows a summary of the customer’s account and recent transactions (Figure 
10-4). The Customer tab displays the customer’s open balance and the credit limit 
you’ve set for that customer so you can see whether the new invoice exceeds that 
limit. You can also review recent transactions to check whether payments have come 
in before you send an invoice for finance charges. Any notes that you’ve entered 
for the customer appear at the bottom of the panel. Click the > at the panel’s top 
left to expand or collapse it.
 NOTE 	 The right-hand panel’s Transaction tab shows information about the transaction that’s currently 
displayed in the Create Invoices window. The tab’s Summary section shows who created and edited the transac­
tion and when. If there are related transactions, such as a payment or credit memo, they appear in the Related 
Transactions section.
CHOOSING AN INVOICE TEMPLATE
The option you choose in the Template drop-down list near the top of the Create 
Invoices window determines which fields appear on your invoices and how they’re 
laid out. For example, you might use two templates: one for printing on your com­
pany letterhead and one for invoices you send electronically. Choosing a template 
before doing anything else is the best way to prevent printing the wrong invoice 
on expensive stationery.

QuickBooks remembers which template you chose when you created your last 
invoice. So if you use only one invoice template, choose it on your first invoice, and 
the program chooses it for you from then on. But if you switch among invoices, be 
sure to select the correct template for the invoice you’re creating.
 NOTE 	 Templates aren’t linked to customers. If you pick a template when you create an invoice for one 
customer, QuickBooks chooses that same template for your next invoice, regardless of which customer it’s for.
You can switch templates anytime. When you choose a template, the Create Invoices 
window displays the appropriate fields and layout. If you’ve already filled in an in­
voice, changing the template doesn’t throw out the data you entered; QuickBooks 
simply displays it in the new template. However, QuickBooks won’t display settings 
like your company logo, fonts, and other formatting until you print or preview the 
invoice (page 308).

CREATING 
INVOICES
Many small companies are perfectly happy with the invoice templates that Quick­
Books provides. When you create your first invoice, you might not even think about 
the layout of the fields. But if you run across a billing task that the current template 
can’t handle, don’t panic: You can choose from several built-in templates. And if you 
want your invoices to reflect your company’s style and image, you can create your 
own custom templates (see page 707).
The options you see in the Template drop-down list depend on the QuickBooks 
edition you use. Before you accept the template that QuickBooks chooses, in the 
Template drop-down list, quickly select and review the templates to see whether 
you like any of them better. Here are a few of the more popular built-in templates:
• Intuit Product Invoice. This template is useful if you sell products with or without 
services. It’s set up to show information like the quantity, item code, price for 
each item, total charge for each item, sales tax, and shipping info—including 
the ship date, shipping method, and FOB.
• Intuit Service Invoice. This template doesn’t bother with shipping fields because 
services are performed, not shipped. It includes fields for the item, quantity, 
description, rate, amount, tax, and purchase order number.
• Intuit Professional Invoice. The only difference between this template and the 
Intuit Service Invoice is that this one doesn’t include a P.O. Number field, and 
the quantity (Qty) column follows the Description column.
• Progress Invoice. If you bill customers based on the progress you’ve made 
on their jobs, use this template, which has columns for your estimates, prior 
charges, and new totals. It appears in the Template drop-down list only if you 
turn on the preference for progress invoicing (see page 655).
 NOTE 	 The Intuit Packing Slip template is included in the Template drop-down list even though it isn’t an 
invoice template. It’s listed there because, when you ship products to customers, you can print an invoice and 
packing slip from the Create Invoices window (see page 312).
• Fixed Fee Invoice. This template drops the quantity and rate fields, since the 
invoice shows only the total charge. It includes fields for the date, item, descrip­
tion, tax, and purchase order number.
• Time & Expense Invoice. If you bill customers by the hour, this template is the 
one to use. It includes columns for hours and an hourly rate, and it calculates 
the resulting total. (The Attorney’s Invoice template is identical to this one 
except in name.)
THE OTHER HEADER FIELDS
As Figure 10-5 shows, QuickBooks can fill in most of the remaining header fields for 
you. Although the following fields don’t appear on every invoice template, here’s 
how to fill in any empty fields or change the ones that QuickBooks didn’t complete 
the way you want:

Chapter 10: Invoicing
233
CREATING 
INVOICES
• Class. If you turned on the class-tracking feature (page 140) to categorize your 
income and expenses in different ways, choose a class for the invoice. If you skip 
this box and have the class reminder preference turned on, QuickBooks tells 
you that the box is empty when you try to save the invoice. Although you can 
save the invoice without a class (if classes don’t apply to the transaction, say), 
it’s important to assign classes to every class-related transaction if you want 
your class-based reports to be accurate. For example, if you use classes to track 
income by partner and save an invoice without a class, the partner who deliv­
ered the services on the invoice might complain about the size of her paycheck.
FIGURE 10-5
After you choose a 
customer, if you’ve as-
signed a price level to that 
customer’s record (page 
77), the name of the price 
level appears in brackets 
next to the Customer:Job 
field. You can change the 
customer’s price level by 
editing the customer’s 
record (page 86), or you 
can choose existing price 
levels to change the price 
you charge as you add 
items to the invoice (see 
the box on page 235).
 NOTE 	 If you work with multiple currencies, then at the top of the Create Invoices window, the Account box 
appears and shows the Accounts Receivable (AR) account for the invoice’s income. QuickBooks creates an ad­
ditional Accounts Receivable account (page 57) for a currency, such as Account Receivable-EUR, when you assign 
that currency to the first new customer that uses it and then save the customer record.
• Date. Out of the box, QuickBooks fills in the current date here, which is fine if 
you create invoices when you make sales. But service businesses often send 
invoices on a schedule—the last day of the month is a popular choice. If you 
want to get a head start on your invoices, you can change your QuickBooks 
preferences so the program uses the same date for every subsequent invoice 
(until you change the date), making your end-of-month invoicing a tiny bit easier. 
Page 650 tells you how to do that.
• Invoice #. When you create your first invoice, type the number that you want to 
start with. For example, if you’d rather not reveal that this is your first invoice, 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
234
CREATING 
INVOICES
type a number such as 245. Then, each time you create a new invoice, Quick­
Books increases the number in this field by one: 246, 247, and so on.
 TIP 	 Press the plus (+) or minus (–) key to increase or decrease the invoice number by one. When you save 
the current invoice, QuickBooks considers its invoice number the starting point for subsequent numbers.
If your last invoice was a mistake, the best thing to do is to void it (page 294). If you delete it instead, you’ll 
end up with a gap in your invoice numbers. For example, when you delete invoice number 203, QuickBooks has 
already set the next invoice number to 204. So, if you notice the gap, in the Invoice # box, type the number you 
want to use to get QuickBooks back on track, and void incorrect invoices from now on.
• Bill To. This field is essential if you mail invoices. When the customer record 
includes a billing address (page 74), QuickBooks puts that address in this field. 
If you email invoices, a billing address isn’t necessary—the customer name in 
this field simply identifies the customer on the emailed form.
• Ship To. If you sell services, you don’t need an address to ship to. But if you sell 
products, you need a shipping address to send the products to your customer. 
When you use a template like Intuit Product Invoice, QuickBooks puts the ship­
ping address from the customer’s record in this field. If you create additional 
shipping addresses (for different office locations, say), click the down arrow 
to the right of the Ship To drop-down list and choose the address you want.
• P.O. Number. If your customer issued a purchase order for the goods and ser­
vices on your invoice, type that purchase order number here.
• Terms. Typically, you set up payment terms when you create customers, and 
you then use those terms for every invoice. When the customer’s record includes 
payment terms (page 76), QuickBooks uses them to fill in this field. However, if 
you decide to change the terms—perhaps due to the customer’s failing financial 
strength—choose a different term here, such as “Due on receipt.”
 NOTE 	 If QuickBooks fills in fields with incorrect values, make the corrections on the invoice. When you save 
the invoice, QuickBooks asks if you’d like the new values to appear the next time, as shown in Figure 10-6.

• Rep. If you assigned a sales rep in the customer’s record (page 77), QuickBooks 
fills in this field for you. If the sales rep changes from invoice to invoice (for 
instance, when the rep is the person who takes a phone order) and you left the 
Rep field blank in the customer’s record, choose the right person here. Leave 
the field blank if the transaction doesn’t have a sales rep.
• Ship. QuickBooks fills in the current date here. If you plan to ship on a different 
date (when the products arrive from your warehouse, for example), type or 
choose the correct date.
• Via. If you specified a value in the Usual Shipping Method preference (page 663), 
QuickBooks enters that value here. To choose a different shipping method for this 
invoice—for instance, when your customer needs the order right away—click this 
field and select the one you want. (Some templates label this field “Ship Via.”)
• F.O.B. This stands for “free on board” and signifies the physical point at which 
the customer becomes responsible for the shipment. That means that if the 
shipment becomes lost or damaged beyond the FOB point, it’s the customer’s 
problem. If you set the Usual FOB preference (page 663), QuickBooks enters 
that location here. To choose a different FOB for this order, type the location 
you want.
 NOTE 	 Unlike many of the other fields in the invoice header area, the F.O.B. box doesn’t include a drop-down 
list. QuickBooks doesn’t keep a list of FOB locations because most companies pick one FOB point and stick with it.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Mysterious Price Changes
One of my Service items costs $150 per hour. But when I cre-
ated a customer invoice for that item, the Price Each came up 
as $120. What’s going on?
Before you rush to correct that Service item’s price, look near 
the top of the Create Invoices window, to the right of the 
Customer:Job field. If you see text in square brackets, such as 
“[Loyalty],” you’ll know that you set up your customer with a 
price level (page 77). Instead of a mistake, this price adjustment 
on your invoice is actually a clever and convenient feature.
Price levels are percentage increases or decreases that you can 
apply to the prices you charge. For example, you can set up 
price levels to give discounts to your high-volume customers 
or mark up prices for customers known for their frequent use 
of your customer-service line. To use price levels, you have to 
turn on the Price Level preference (page 663).
If you assign a price level to a customer, QuickBooks automati-
cally applies that price-level percentage to every item you add 
to invoices for that customer. The only indication that Quick-
Books has applied the price level is the price level’s name to the 
right of the Customer:Job field (and the items’ altered prices).
You can also apply price levels to individual items on an 
invoice. For example, suppose you offer a 20 percent discount 
on a different item each month. When an item is the monthly 
special, you can apply the Monthly Special price level to just 
that item, as shown in Figure 10-7.
When you use price levels, your customers don’t see that the 
price increases or decreases, which means they could take 
your discounts for granted. So if you want to emphasize the 
discounts you apply, use a Discount item instead to visibly 
reduce prices on your invoices (see page 241).

FIGURE 10-7
To apply a price level to a single 
item, click the Price Each (or Rate) 
field for the item that’s on special. 
When QuickBooks displays a down

a drop-down list is available, click 
the arrow, and then choose the 
price level you want.
Entering Invoice Line Items
If you dutifully studied Chapter 5, you know about the different types of items you 
can add to invoices. This section describes how to fill in a line in the Create Invoices 
window’s line-item table to charge your customers for the things they buy. (The box 
on page 238 explains a shortcut for speeding up this process.)
The order in which you add items to an invoice is important. For example, when 
you add a Subtotal item, QuickBooks subtotals all the preceding items up to the 
previous Subtotal item (if there is one). The program does nothing to check that you 
add items in the correct order—you can add a Subtotal item as the first line item, 
even though that does nothing for your invoice. See page 239 for the full scoop on 
adding Subtotal, Discount, and Other Charge items in the right order.
 NOTE 	 If multiple currencies are turned on and you have customers set up to use foreign currencies, when you 
create an invoice for one of those customers, QuickBooks automatically applies the exchange rate you entered for 
that currency to item prices and service rates. (See the box on page 461 to learn how to download exchange rates 
and obtain exchange rates for certain dates.) To use a specific exchange rate in an invoice, fill in the “Exchange 
Rate 1 [currency] =” box with the exchange rate before you add items to the invoice. (If you forgot to change the 
exchange rate before adding items, delete the lines in the invoice, adjust the exchange rate, and then add the 
items again.)

The order of columns in the line-item table varies from template to template. This 
section lists the columns in the order they appear on the Intuit Product Invoice 
template (shown in Figure 10-8):
• Quantity. For products, type a quantity. For services you sell by the hour (or 
other units of time), type the number of time units. (See page 255 to learn how 
to select hours from a timesheet.) If you sell services at a flat rate, you can leave 
this cell blank and simply fill in the Amount cell.
 NOTE 	 If you type a quantity for a product that exceeds the number you have on hand, QuickBooks Pro 
simply warns you that you don’t have enough. QuickBooks Premier displays the same warning and tells you how 
many you have on hand, how many are on sales orders (page 260), and the total available.
Quantity doesn’t apply if the item is a discount, subtotal, or sales tax. So if you 
choose one of these items after entering a quantity, QuickBooks removes the 
value in the Quantity cell.
• Item Code. Click this cell and then choose an item from the drop-down list (see 
Chapter 5 for details on items). Depending on the info you entered when you 
created this item (page 106), QuickBooks may fill in the Description and Price 
Each (or Rate) cells for you.
• Description. If you set up inventory items with standard descriptions, Quick­
Books automatically puts them in this cell. But you can edit a description to, for 
example, add details—like changing the generic description “Security service” 
to the more specific “Nightly rounds every two hours.”
FIGURE 10-8
In the Intuit Product Invoice 
template, the Quantity 
column comes first. After 
you choose an item, make 
sure to check the value in the 
Amount cell. If the number 
looks too large or small, the 
quantity you entered might 
not match the item’s units. 
For example, if you charge for 
developing training materials 
by the hour but charge for 
teaching a training class by 
the day, the quantity for 
developing training materials 
has to be in hours and the 
quantity for teaching in days.

CREATING 
INVOICES
• Price Each (or Rate). Depending on the type of item you’re adding to the 
invoice, QuickBooks goes to the item’s record and grabs the value in the Sales 
Price field or Rate field and puts it here. For example, an Inventory Part item’s 
price always comes from the Sales Price field, whereas Service items use the 
Rate field (unless a partner or subcontractor performs the work, in which case 
they use the Sales Price field).
• Class. If you turned on classes (page 140), you can pick a class for this item here.
• Amount. QuickBooks calculates the value in this cell by multiplying the quantity 
by the number in the Price Each (or Rate) field. But nothing stops you from 
simply typing a value in this field, which is exactly what you want for a fixed-
fee contract. (For the full story on invoicing for fixed-fee contracts, see the box 
on page 240.)
• Tax. If you turned on the sales tax preference (page 664), QuickBooks displays 
this cell and fills it in with the taxable status you specified in the item’s record, 
and fills in the Tax box below the table with the Sales Tax item you set in the 
customer’s record. (The tax rate for the Sales Tax item you select appears in the 
Create Invoices window’s footer to the right of the Tax box.) With the taxable 
status of your customers (page 77) and the items you sell (page 109) in place, 
QuickBooks can automatically handle sales tax on your invoices. For example, 
when an item is taxable and the customer is liable for paying sales tax, the pro­
gram calculates the total sales tax by adding up all the taxable items on your 
invoice and multiplying that number by the tax rate in the Tax box below the 
table; it then displays this value below the table (see Figure 10-8).
 TIP 	 If you notice that an item’s taxable status isn’t correct, don’t change the value in the Tax cell. You’re 
better off correcting the customer’s or item’s tax status so QuickBooks can calculate tax correctly in the future.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Adding Group Items to Invoices
If the same items frequently appear together on your invoices, 
you can add all those items in one step by creating a Group 
item (page 114). Any type of item is fair game for a Group 
item, so you can include Service items, discounts, subtotals, 
and other charges.
For example, customers who buy your deluxe vinyl sofa covers 
also tend to purchase the dirt-magnet front hall runner and the 
faux-marble garage floor liner. So you could create a Group 
item (perhaps called the Neat Freak Package) that includes the 
items for the sofa cover, runner, and liner, with the quantity 
you typically sell of each item.
To add a Group item to an invoice, in the Create Invoices win-
dow’s item drop-down list (which, depending on the invoice 
template you’re using, is labeled “Item” or “Item Code”), simply 
choose the Group item you created. QuickBooks fills in the first 
line by putting the name of the Group item in the item cell. 
Then the program adds additional lines (including quantity, 
description, and price) for the individual items in the group, 
such as the sofa cover, runner, and liner.

INVOICES
MODIFYING LINE ITEMS
Sometimes you forget to add line items you need. For example, say you’ve added 
several services and inventory items to your invoice and then realize that you need 
Subtotal items following the last service and last inventory items so you can apply a 
shipping charge to only the inventory items. Or if your customer changes his mind, 
you can insert or delete a line item. You can also copy and paste line items. 
Here’s how to modify lines in the line-item table:
• Insert a line. Right-click the line above which you want to add a line, and then 
choose Insert Line from the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 10-9. If you prefer 
keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+Insert instead.
• Delete a line. Right-click the line you want to get rid of and choose Delete Line 
from the shortcut menu, or press Ctrl+Delete.
• Copy a line. Right-click the line you want to copy, and then choose Copy Line 
from the shortcut menu. Why might you do this? Suppose you filled in a line for 
a taxable product below the Subtotal item you added for taxable items. Instead 
of recreating the line item in the right location, it might be quicker to copy this 
line, and then paste it where it should go. Then be sure to delete the original line.
• Paste a line. Right-click the line above which you want to paste the copied line 
and choose Paste Line from the shortcut menu.
QuickBooks adjusts the invoice’s lines accordingly.
FIGURE 10-9
As you add items to the 
table, QuickBooks adds 
blank lines (and new 
pages, if needed) to your 
invoice. The number of 
items visible depends 
on the size of the Create 
Invoices window. You can 
also move the scroll bar 
up or down, or resize the 
window by maximizing it 
or dragging a corner of it.
Applying Subtotals, Discounts, and Percentage Charges
When you add Services, Inventory Parts, and Non-inventory Parts (see Chapter 5) 
to an invoice’s line-item table, they don’t affect their neighbors in any way. However, 
when you offer percentage discounts on what you sell or include Other Charge items 
that calculate shipping as a percentage of price, the order in which you add items 
becomes crucial. And if you want to apply a percentage calculation like a discount

or a shipping fee to several items, you’ll need one or more Subtotal items to make 
the calculation work.
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Invoicing Fixed-Price Contracts
Fixed-price contracts are risky because you have to swallow any 
cost overruns beyond the fixed price you charge. But if you’ve 
sharpened your skills on similar projects in the past and can 
estimate your costs with reasonable accuracy, fixed-price con-
tracts can provide opportunities for better-than-average profit.
Once you and your customer agree on the fixed price, that 
amount is all that matters to the customer. Even if you track 
the costs of performing a job, your customer never sees those 
numbers. In QuickBooks, you can invoice fixed-price contracts 
in two different ways:
• Group item. If you use the same set of services and 
products for multiple jobs, create a Group item that 
includes each service and product you deliver and set 
up the Group item to hide the details of the underlying 
services and products (page 114). Then add the Group item 
to your invoice and change the price of the Group item 
to your fixed price.
• Service item. If every fixed-price job is different, create 
a Service item (page 108) called something like Fixed Fee 
and leave its Rate field set to 0.00. When you add that item 
to an invoice, fill in its Rate field with the full amount of 
the fixed-price contract. Then, when you reach a milestone 
that warrants a payment, create a progress invoice: In 
the Quantity column, type the decimal that equates to 
the percentage completed (such as .25 for 25 percent), 
and QuickBooks calculates the payment by multiplying 
the quantity by the fixed-price amount.
You first learned about Subtotal, Discount, and Other Charge items in Chapter 5. 
Figure 10-10 shows how to combine them to calculate percentage discounts and add 
markups to the items on your invoices. Here’s how these items work:
• The item labeled “1” in Figure 10-10 is a Subtotal item that adds up the values of 
all the items up to the previous Subtotal item. For example, to keep the Service 
items out of the product subtotal, add a Subtotal item after the last Service item.
• As shown by the item labeled “2” in Figure 10-10, for Discount and Other Charge 
items created as percentages, QuickBooks multiplies the percentage by the 
total on the preceding line. (If the discount applies to only one item, add the 
Discount item immediately below the item you want to discount.)
• To apply a percentage discount to several items, use a Subtotal item to total their 
cost (such as the item labeled “3” in Figure 10-10), and then add a percentage 
Discount or Other Charge item on the line following that subtotal (like the item 
labeled “4” in Figure 10-10).
Here are the steps for arranging Subtotal, Discount, and Other Charge items to 
calculate percentages on invoice items:
1.	 If you want to discount several items on an invoice, enter all those items 
one after the other.
Even though the Balance Due field below the line-item table shows the total of 
all items, to apply a discount to all of them, you’ll need to add a Subtotal item 
to the line-item table.

Chapter 10: Invoicing
241
CREATING 
INVOICES
FIGURE 10-10
This line-item table 
includes Subtotal and 
Discount items that apply 
to only some of the items 
on this invoice.
2.	 Add a Subtotal item after the last item you want to discount, like the Product 
Subtotal item labeled “3” in Figure 10-10.
The Subtotal item adds up all the preceding line items up to the previous Sub­
total. For example, in Figure 10-10, the Services Subtotal item (labeled “1”) is 
a subtotal of all the Service items on the invoice. The Product Subtotal item 
(labeled “3”) adds up all items between the Services Subtotal and the Product 
Subtotal items.
3.	 To apply a percentage discount or charge to the subtotal, add a Discount 
or Other Charge item (labeled “4” in Figure 10-10) to the line immediately 
below the Subtotal item you added in step 2.
If you’ve already added other items to the invoice, right-click the line immedi­
ately below the Subtotal item, and then choose Insert Line from the shortcut 
menu. That inserts the percentage discount or charge item on the line below 
the Subtotal item.
4.	 If you have additional items that you don’t want to include in the discount 
or charge, add those below the Discount or Other Charge item.
 NOTE 	 These steps also work for Other Charge items that you set up as percentages, such as shipping, as 
shown at the bottom of Figure 10-10.

Adding a Message to the Customer
Your invoices can include messages to your customers—for instance, thanking them 
for their business or asking for feedback. In the Customer Message drop-down list, 
choose the message you want to include. The messages in this drop-down list are 
the ones you’ve added to the Customer Message List (page 151). If the message you 
want to use isn’t listed, then click <Add New> to open the New Customer Message 
dialog box.
 TIP 	 Don’t use the Customer Message List for info that changes with every invoice, such as the purchase order 
number or date range for the invoice. Instead, add unique information to the cover letter or email that you send 
with the invoice.
Adding a Link to Pay Online
Intuit’s online payment services are changing in 2015. But these new and improved 
services will make their debut near the end of 2014. Once these new online payment 
services are available, you can learn about them and how to use them in QuickBooks 
2015 by heading to this book’s Missing CD page at www.missing manuals.com/cds 
and downloading Appendix E.
Choosing How to Send the Invoice
On the Create Invoices window’s Main tab (if it’s not selected, click it in the window’s 
upper-left corner), you’ll find two checkboxes that simplify sending invoices to 
customers: Print Later and Email Later. But these checkboxes don’t tell the whole 
story—you actually have five options for sending invoices:
• Print now. If you create only the occasional invoice and send it as soon as it’s 
complete, turn off both checkboxes. Then, on the Create Invoices window’s Main 
tab, click Print and follow the instructions on page 313.
• Print later. If you want to add the invoice to a queue to print later, turn on the 
Print Later checkbox. That way you can print all the invoices in the queue, as 
described on page 313.
• Email now. In the Create Invoices window’s Main tab, click the Email button 
(it looks like an envelope) and follow the instructions for emailing invoices on 
page 319.
• Email later. If you want to add the invoice to a queue to email later, turn on 
the Email Later checkbox. You can then send all the invoices in the queue, as 
described on page 319.
 TIP 	 See page 665 if you want to set a preference that automatically turns on the Email Later checkbox if the 
customer’s Preferred Delivery Method is email. Page 665 also explains how QuickBooks works with email programs.
• Print and email later. Turn on both checkboxes if you want to email invoices 
to get the ball rolling and then follow up with paper copies.

If you’re sending an invoice for products you’ve sold, you also have to ship those 
products to your customer. See the box below to learn a convenient and money-
saving way to ship products.
Adding a Memo to Yourself
The Create Invoices window includes a Memo box, which works just like Memo boxes 
throughout QuickBooks. You can use it to remind yourself about something special 
on the invoice or to summarize the transaction. For example, if the invoice is the first 
one for a new customer, you can note that in the Memo box. The memo won’t print 
on the invoices you send to your customers. However, it does appear on your sales 
reports and customer statements, so be careful what you type here.
UP TO SPEED
Shipping Products
If you sell products, making regular runs to the FedEx or UPS 
office gets old quickly. But sitting quietly within QuickBooks 
is a free service that could change the way you ship packages.
The program’s Shipping Manager feature lets you sign up for 
shipping services and start sending out packages right away. 
You can print FedEx, UPS, and U.S. Postal Service shipping 
labels; schedule pickups; and even track package progress 
right in QuickBooks. Shipping Manager fills in shipping labels 
with customer addresses from your QuickBooks invoices, sales 
receipts, or customer records. All you pay are the FedEx, UPS, 
or postal service charges on your shipment.
Here’s where you can find Shipping Manager:
• If you’re creating an invoice for products you plan to ship, 
at the top of the Create Invoices or Sales Receipt window, 
click the Send/Ship tab, and then click the button for the 
shipping method you want to use. In the drop-down menu 
that appears, choose what you want to do, such as ship 
a package, schedule a pickup, or track a package that’s 
already on its way.
• Choose File→Shipping, and then choose Ship FedEx 
Package, Ship UPS Package, or Ship USPS Package.
The first time you choose a shipping action, such as Ship FedEx 
Package, a setup wizard steps you through creating an account 
for that shipping company.
 NOTE 	 The Open Invoices report (Reports→Customers & Receivables→Open Invoices) is handy when you 
want to see all the invoices for which you haven’t yet received payment. It lists all the invoices for each customer 
and job, when they’re due, and their open balances. If the invoices are overdue, the Aging column shows just 
how late they are. Income Tracker (page 338) is another way to check up on upcoming or overdue income.
Creating Batch Invoices
If you send invoices with the same items and the same quantities to many of your 
customers, QuickBooks can save you lots of time. Instead of creating individual 
invoices for each customer, you can set up a single batch invoice and send it to as 
many customers as you want. And you can speed things up even more by creating 
a billing group that includes all the customers that receive the invoice, so you don’t 
have to re-select them each time you send a batch invoice.

 NOTE 	 You can’t use the batch invoice feature if you have multiple currencies turned on (page 656). That’s 
why, when that preference is turned on, the Create Batch Invoices option doesn’t appear in the Customers menu.
Before You Create Your First Batch Invoice
Batch invoices use the payment terms, sales tax rates, and send methods you specify 
for each customer, so be sure to fill in these fields in customers’ records before you 
create your first batch invoice. These fields are on the Payment Settings, Sales Tax 
Settings, and Additional Info tabs of the Create Customer and Edit Customer win­
dows; they’re explained on page 75, page 77, and page 77, respectively. The easiest 
way to find and fill in any missing values is with the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries 
window (page 127).
Setting Up a Batch Invoice
Here’s how to create a batch invoice for several customers:
1.	 Choose Customers→Create Batch Invoices.
The Batch Invoice window opens (Figure 10-11).
 NOTE 	 If this is your first time using Create Batch Invoices, the “Is your customer info set up correctly?” 
message box appears, reminding you that you need to fill in terms, sales tax, and send method settings for your 
batch invoice customers. Click OK to close it and open the Batch Invoice window. If you need to fill in information 
for your customers, close the Batch Invoice window and choose Lists→Add/Edit Multiple List Entries to open the 
Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window to complete your customers’ records.

an existing group from the Billing Group drop-down list.
If you select individual customers, you can choose adjacent names by clicking 
the first customer’s name and then Shift-clicking the last customer’s name. You 
can also Ctrl-click each customer name you want to select.
If you choose a billing group, the name of the group appears above the Custom­
ers In This Group box, and the individual names appear in the box itself, as shown 
in Figure 10-11. (The box on page 246 explains how to create billing groups.)
 NOTE 	 If you add individual customers and a billing group to the Customers In This Group list, when you 
click away from the list, a Batch Invoice message box asks if you want to save the changes to the billing group. 
Click Yes to add the individual customers to this billing group and use the full list for the batch invoice. Click No 
to use the list of customers for this batch invoice while leaving the saved billing group as it is. Or click Cancel to 
return to the Batch Invoice window to make additional changes.
3.	 After you add the appropriate customers to the Customers In This Group 
list, click Next.
On the “Step 2 of 3” screen that appears, QuickBooks automatically puts to­
day’s date in the Date box and displays a table for the next step in the process: 
adding items to the invoice.
4.	 To use a different date, choose it in the Date box.
You can also choose a different invoice template from the Template drop-down 
list.
5.	 In the line-item table (Figure 10-12), fill in the items you want to add to the 
invoice just as you do for a regular invoice (page 226).
You can add any item from your Item List to a batch invoice.
6.	 After you fill in the items for the invoice, click Next.
The “Step 3 of 3” screen lists the customers who will receive the invoice, includ­
ing their terms, send methods, tax info, and other information. If you notice any 
errors or omissions, click Back to correct them.
7.	 When everything looks good, click Create Invoices.
QuickBooks creates invoices for the selected customers. The Batch Invoice 
Summary dialog box appears and shows how many invoices are set up to print 
and how many to email, based on the customers’ preferred delivery methods. 
(The dialog box mentions the customer’s Preferred Send Method, but the field 
in the customer record is actually labeled “Preferred Delivery Method.”) If the 
Preferred Delivery Method for any of the customers is set to None, the dialog

Creating a Billing Group
Billing groups make it easy to select all the customers who 
receive the same batch invoice. Once you set up a billing group, 
you can select it in the Batch Invoice window, and QuickBooks 
automatically adds all the customers in it to the Customers In 
This Group box in one fell swoop.
Here’s how to create a billing group:
1.	 In the Batch Invoice window (Customers→Create Batch 
Invoices), before you select customer names, in the Billing 
Group drop-down list, choose <Add New>.
2.	 In the Group Name dialog box, type a name of the 
group (such as WeightLoss for all the customers on your 
monthly diet plan, for example), and then click Save. 
3.	 In the Batch Invoice window’s Search Results list, Ctrl-
click all the customers you want to add to the group, and 
then click Add to copy their names to the Customers In 
This Group box.
4.	 Below the Customers In This Group box, click the Save 
Group button.
QuickBooks saves your new billing group so you can use it again 
simply by selecting it in the Batch Invoice window.

PAYMENTS, 
AND 
RETAINERS
Deposits, Down Payments, and Retainers
Deposits, down payments, and retainers are all prepayments: money that customers 
give you that you haven’t actually earned yet. For example, a customer might give 
you a down payment to reserve a spot in your busy schedule. Receiving money for 
something you didn’t do feels good, but don’t make the mistake of considering that 
money yours. Until you perform services or deliver products to earn that money, 
the down payment is more like a loan from the customer than income. Prepayments 
belong to your customers until you earn them, and they require a bit more care than 
payments you receive for completed work and delivered products. This section 
explains how to manage the intricacies of customer prepayments.
Setting Up QuickBooks for Prepayments
If you accept prepayments of any kind, you need an account in your chart of ac­
counts to keep that money separate from your income. You also need an item that 
you can add to your invoices to deduct prepayments from what your customers owe:
• Prepayment account. Because unearned money from a customer is like a loan, 
create an Other Current Liability account in your chart of accounts (see page 
57) to hold prepayments. Call it something like Customer Prepayments.
• Prepayment item. Create a Prepayment item in your Item List, as shown in 
Figure 10-13.
FIGURE 10-13
Whether you accept deposits 
or retainers for services or 
products, create a Service 
item for these prepayments. 
When you create this item, 
assign it to the prepayment 
account you created.
Recording Prepayments
When a customer hands you a check for a deposit or a down payment, the first 
thing you should do is wait until she’s out of earshot to yell, “Yippee!” The second 
thing is to record the prepayment in QuickBooks. You haven’t done any work yet, 
so there’s no invoice to apply the payment to. Fortunately, a sales receipt can not 
only record a prepayment in QuickBooks: when you print it, it also acts as a receipt 
for your customer. Here’s how to create one:
1.	 Make sure the Sales Receipts preference is turned on.
If you don’t see a Create Sales Receipts icon in the Home Page’s Custom­
ers panel or an Enter Sales Receipts entry in the Customers menu, choose 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
248
DEPOSITS, 
DOWN 
PAYMENTS, 
AND 
RETAINERS
Edit→Preferences→Desktop View, and then click the Company Preferences 
tab. Turn on the Sales Receipts checkbox, and then click OK.
2.	 On the Home Page, click the Create Sales Receipts icon (or choose 
Customers→Enter Sales Receipts).
QuickBooks opens the Enter Sales Receipts window to a blank receipt.
3.	 In the Customer:Job box, choose the customer or job from which you re­
ceived the prepayment.
QuickBooks fills in some of the fields, such as the customer’s address in the 
Sold To box, with information from the customer’s record.
4.	 Fill in the other header boxes as you would for a regular sales receipt (see 
page 362).
If you use classes, in the Class box, choose a class to track the prepayment. If 
you have a customized template just for prepayments (page 707), in the Tem­
plate drop-down list, select that template. In the Date box, choose the date that 
you received the prepayment. In the Payment Method box, pick the method 
the customer used to pay you. If the customer paid by check, in the Check No. 
box, type the check number for reference.
5.	 As shown in Figure 10-14, in the window’s table, click the first Item cell 
and use its drop-down list to choose the Prepayment item you set up (for 
example, a Service item called something like “Deposits and Retainers,” 
as described on page 247).
This step is the key to recording a prepayment to the correct account. Because 
your Prepayment items are tied to an Other Current Liability account, Quick­
Books doesn’t post the payment as income, but rather as money owed to your 
customer.
6.	 In the Amount cell, type the amount of the prepayment.
Don’t bother with entering values in the Qty and Rate cells—the sales receipt 
simply records the total that the customer gave you. You’ll add the details for 
services and products later when you create invoices.
7.	 Complete the sales receipt as you would any other payment form.
For example, add a message to the customer, if you like. At the top of the Enter 
Sales Receipt window, click Email or Print to provide the customer with a receipt. 
If you turned off the preference to use the Undeposited Funds account (page 
657), you’ll see a Deposit To box. In this box, choose Undeposited Funds if you 
plan to hold the payment and deposit it with others; if you’re going to race 
to the bank as soon as you record the transaction, choose your bank account 
instead. (If you turn on the preference to use the Undeposited Funds account, 
QuickBooks automatically deposits payments to the Undeposited Funds ac­
count, so the Deposit To box doesn’t appear in the Enter Sales Receipt window.)

income until you include it 
on an invoice, which you’ll 
learn how to do in the next 
section.
8.	 Click Save & Close.
QuickBooks posts the payment to your prepayment account and closes the 
Enter Sales Receipts window.
Applying a Deposit, Down Payment, or Retainer
When you finally start to deliver stuff to customers who’ve paid up front, you invoice 
them as usual. But the invoice you create needs one additional line item that deducts 
the customer’s prepayment from the invoice balance.
Create the invoice as you normally would with items for the services, products, 
charges, and discounts (page 226). After you’ve added all those items, add the item 
for the prepayment and fill in the Amount cell with a negative number to deduct 
the prepayment from the invoice amount, as shown in Figure 10-15. Once you ap­
ply the prepayment to an invoice in this way, QuickBooks transfers the money from 
your prepayment account to reduce the customer’s Accounts Receivable balance.
 NOTE 	 If the charges on the invoice are less than the amount of the customer’s deposit, deduct only as much 
of the deposit as you need; you can apply the rest of it to the next invoice.

Refunding Prepayments
Deposits and down payments don’t guarantee that your customers will follow through 
with their projects or orders. For example, say a customer makes a deposit on decor 
for his bachelor pad. But when he meets his future wife at the monster truck rally, 
his plan for the bachelor pad is crushed as flat as the cars under the trucks’ wheels. 
Of course your customer wants his money back, which means you share some of 
his disappointment.
FIGURE 10-15
When you create an 
invoice for the customer, 
the prepayment offsets 
the customer’s balance. 
To deduct the prepay-
ment from the invoice’s 
balance, in the Amount 
cell, enter the prepayment 
as a negative number, as 
shown here.
Your first step is to determine how much money the customer gets back. For ex­
ample, if a customer cancels an order before you’ve purchased the products, you 
might refund the entire deposit. However, if the leopard-print wallpaper has already 
arrived, you might keep part of the deposit as a restocking fee.
After you decide how much of the deposit you’re going to keep, you have to do two 
things: move the portion of the deposit that you’re keeping from the prepayment 
account to an income account, and then refund the rest of the deposit. Here’s how 
to do both:
1.	 Create an invoice for the customer or job by choosing Customers→Create 
Invoices, and then, in the Customer:Job box, choosing the customer.
You create an invoice to turn the deposit you’re keeping into income.

Chapter 10: Invoicing
251
DEPOSITS, 
DOWN 
PAYMENTS, 
AND 
RETAINERS
2.	 In the first Item cell, choose an item related to the canceled job or order.
For example, if you’re keeping a deposit for a product you ordered, choose the 
item for that product. If the deposit was for services you planned to perform, 
choose the appropriate Service item instead.
3.	 In the item’s Amount cell, type the amount of the deposit that you’re 
keeping.
Because these items are connected to income accounts (see Chapter 5), this 
first line in the invoice is where you assign the amount of the deposit that you’re 
keeping to the correct income account for the products or services you sold.
4.	 In the table’s second line, add the Prepayment item and fill in the amount of 
the deposit you’re keeping as a negative amount, as shown in Figure 10-16.
This item removes the amount of the deposit you’re keeping from your liability 
account so you no longer owe the customer that money.
FIGURE 10-16
In the first row’s Amount 
cell, enter the amount of 
the deposit you’re keeping 
as a positive number. 
Then, in the Amount cell 
for the prepayment (the 
second row), type a nega-
tive number, which makes 
the invoice’s balance zero 
and deducts the deposit 
from the prepayment li-
ability account, so you no 
longer “owe” the customer 
that money.
5.	 Click Save & Close.
QuickBooks removes the deposit you’re keeping from the prepayment liability 
account and posts that money to the income account associated with the item 
you selected in step 2. If you’re keeping the whole deposit, you’re done. But if 
you aren’t keeping the entire amount, you have to refund the rest to the cus­
tomer, so continue on to the next step.
6.	 To refund the rest of the deposit, create a credit memo for the remainder 
(page 288).
In the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window’s table, add the Prepayment 
item you used in the invoice. In the Amount cell, type the amount that you’re 
refunding.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
252
DEPOSITS, 
DOWN 
PAYMENTS, 
AND

7.	 Click Save & Close.
QuickBooks removes the remaining deposit amount from your prepayment 
liability account. Because the credit memo has a credit balance, QuickBooks 
opens the Available Credit dialog box.
8.	 In the Available Credit dialog box, choose the “Give a refund” option, and 
then click OK.
QuickBooks opens the Issue a Refund dialog box and fills in the customer or 
job, the account from which the refund is issued, and the refund amount. If you 
want to refund the deposit from a different account, choose a different refund 
payment method or account.
9.	 Click OK to create the refund.
All that’s left for you to do is mail the refund check.
Invoicing for Billable Time and Costs
When you work on a time-and-materials contract, you charge the customer for labor 
costs plus job expenses. Cost-plus contracts are similar except that you charge a fee 
on top of the job costs. Contracts like these are both low risk and low reward—in 
effect, you’re earning an hourly wage for the time you work. For these types of 
contracts, it’s critical that you capture all the expenses associated with the job or 
you’ll lose some of the profit that the contract offers.
QuickBooks helps you get those billable items into your invoices. You have to tell 
the program about every hour worked and every expense you incur for a customer 
or job. But once you do that, it’s easy to build an invoice that captures these billable 
items. You can add billable time and costs to an invoice when it’s open in the Create 
Invoices window. And, when you open the Create Invoices window in QuickBooks 
Pro or Premier and choose a customer or job, the program reminds you about out­
standing billable time and costs. QuickBooks Premier also has a feature specifically 
for creating invoices for billable time and costs. The following sections tell you how 
to perform all these tasks.
Setting Up Invoicing for Time and Costs
In some industries, like consulting and law, invoicing for time and expenses is the 
norm. But before you can pop your billable time and expenses into QuickBooks 
invoices, you first need to record them as billable items and assign them to the 
correct customer or job. Here are the billable items you can add to invoices and the 
chapters that tell you about them:
• Billable time. Chapter 8 (page 169) describes how to track billable time and 
assign hours to a customer or job.
• Mileage. Chapter 8 (page 180) describes how to track mileage and assign bill­
able mileage to a customer or job.

Chapter 10: Invoicing
253
INVOICING FOR 
BILLABLE TIME 
AND COSTS
• Purchases and expenses related to a customer or job. Reimbursable expenses 
include products you purchase specifically for a job, services performed by a 
subcontractor, and other expenses such as shipping and postage. Chapter 9 
describes how to make items and expenses reimbursable to a customer or job 
(page 192) as you enter bills, checks, or credit card charges in QuickBooks.
Adding Billable Time and Costs to Invoices
If you use QuickBooks Pro or Premier, you can add billable time and costs directly 
in the Create Invoices window. Here’s how:
1.	 Press Ctrl+I or choose Customers→Create Invoices to open the Create 
Invoices window.
2.	 In the Customer:Job drop-down list, choose the customer or job you want 
to invoice.
If the customer or job has outstanding billable time or expenses, the Billable 
Time/Costs dialog box opens and automatically selects the “Select the out­
standing billable time and costs to add to this invoice?” option, as shown in 
Figure 10-17 (foreground).
FIGURE 10-17
To add billable time and 
costs that haven’t been 
billed to an invoice, keep 
the option that begins 
with “Select” selected 
in this dialog box. If you 
don’t want to bill that time 
and cost yet, select the 
option that begins with 
“Exclude.” 
You can add time and ex-
penses anytime by clicking 
the Add Time/Costs button 
at the top of the Create 
Invoices window.
3.	 In the Billable Time/Costs dialog box, click OK.
The “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box opens.
 NOTE 	 You can open the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box anytime the Create Invoices window 
is open by clicking the Add Time/Costs button on the window’s Main tab.

4.	 Select the time and costs you want to add to the invoice by following the 
instructions that begin on page 255.
Using Invoice for Time & Expenses
If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, the program has a special “Invoice for 
Time & Expenses” feature for adding billable items to invoices. If you turn on this 
feature, it shows you every customer with billable time and expenses waiting to be 
invoiced and how much there is of each type, so it’s easy to see all your outstanding 
billable hours and reimbursable expenses.
To turn on this feature, choose Edit→Preferences→Time & Expenses. On the Com­
pany Preferences tab, turn on the “Create invoices from a list of time and expenses” 
checkbox. (Leave this checkbox turned off if invoicing for time and expenses is the 
exception rather than the rule. If you leave it off, you can still add time and other costs 
to an invoice in the Create Invoices window, as described in the previous section.)
Here’s how to use the “Invoice for Time & Expenses” feature to create an invoice for 
billable time and expenses (see page 243 to learn how to create a batch of billable 
invoices):
1.	 Choose Customers→“Invoice for Time & Expenses” or, on the Home Page, 
click the Invoices icon, and then on the drop-down menu, choose “Invoice 
for Time & Expenses.”
QuickBooks opens the “Invoice for Time & Expenses” window, which lists the 
customers and jobs that have billable time and expenses associated with them. 
The window’s table shows the amount of billable time, expenses, and mileage 
for each customer and job. The Items column shows the reimbursable amount 
for products that you purchased specifically for the customer or job.
2.	 In the Date Range From and To boxes, type the starting and ending dates 
for the time and expenses you want to invoice.
For example, if you want to invoice for billable time and expenses for the previous 
quarter, type the first and last days of the period, like 1/1/2015 and 3/31/2015. 
To invoice for all outstanding time and expenses up to a certain date, leave the 
Date Range From box blank.
3.	 To select a customer or job, click anywhere in its row.
QuickBooks highlights the customer or job you clicked.
4.	 To choose specific billable time and costs to add to the invoice, at the bot­
tom of the window, turn on the “Let me select specific billable costs for this 
Customer:Job” checkbox.
This checkbox is active only when one customer or job is selected. If you select 
more than one customer or job (see page 243 to learn how to create a batch 
of time and expenses invoices), this checkbox is grayed out. If you leave this 
checkbox turned off, the program adds all billable time and costs to the invoice.

Chapter 10: Invoicing
255

BILLABLE TIME

5.	 Click Create Invoice.
If you turned on the “Let me select specific billable costs for this Customer:Job” 
checkbox, QuickBooks opens the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box 
shown in Figure 10-18, which includes tabs for time, expenses, mileage, and 
items (products). (This dialog box is the same one you see if you click Add 
Time/Costs in the Create Invoices window. Proceed to page 255 to learn how 
to add specific billable time and costs to an invoice.)
If you left the “Let me select specific billable costs for this Customer:Job” check­
box turned off, the Create Invoices window opens with your invoice already filled 
out. All you have to do is save it by clicking Save & Close.
FIGURE 10-18
On the “Choose Bill-
able Time and Costs” 
dialog box’s Time tab 
(background), click the 
Options button to tell 
QuickBooks how to handle 
different activities. In the 
“Options for Transferring 
Billable Time” dialog 
box (foreground), the 
program automatically 
selects the setting that 
displays the total hours 
for each Service item. 
Choose the other setting 
if you want QuickBooks 
to add a separate line for 
each activity (to show the 
hours worked each day, 
for instance); with each 
activity on its own line, 
you can transfer activity 
descriptions, notes, or 
both to the invoice.
Selecting Billable Time and Costs
Regardless of how you open the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box (Figure 
10-18), the steps for selecting the billable time and costs to add to an invoice are 
the same. Here’s what you do:
1.	 In the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box, to select all the entries 
on the Time tab, click the Select All button.
QuickBooks adds a checkmark in the first column for every activity and shows 
the total value of the entries you’ve selected on that tab. As you select billable 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
256
INVOICING FOR 
BILLABLE TIME 
AND COSTS
costs on other tabs, each tab shows the total value of the entries you selected, 
as shown in Figure 10-19. The “Total billable time and costs” value below the 
table is the total of all the selected items on all four tabs.
To select or deselect a single row, click its checkmark cell to toggle it on or off.
FIGURE 10-19
Each tab shows the 
number of entries on that 
tab that are available to 
bill and their total value. 
The “Total billable time 
and costs” value below 
the table is the total of all 
the selected items on all 
four tabs. Turning on the 
“Print selected time and 
costs as one invoice item” 
checkbox tells QuickBooks 
to create a single line 
on the invoice for all the 
entries you selected. If 
you leave this checkbox 
turned off, the program 
creates separate lines for 
each entry.
2.	 If you want the invoice to include only one line for all the time and expenses 
you’ve selected, turn on the “Print selected time and costs as one invoice 
item” checkbox below the table.
After you create the invoice in step 6 of this list, in the Create Invoices window, 
you’ll see separate entries for billable items so you can verify that the invoice is 
correct. However, with this checkbox turned on, the printed invoice will include 
only one line, labeled Total Reimbursable Expenses.
 NOTE 	 If you’ve created the invoice with one line for time and costs, it takes several steps to recreate it 
showing individual costs. To change an invoice back to a line-by-line listing, in the Create Invoices window, 
delete the Total Reimbursable Expenses line item. Then click Add Time/Costs on the window’s Main tab to open 
the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box and reselect all the entries you want. Finally, turn off the “Print 
selected time and costs as one invoice item” checkbox, and then click OK.

BILLABLE TIME 
AND COSTS
3.	 Click the Expenses tab, and then click the checkmark cell for each expense 
(like meals, airfare, and other costs) you want to add to the invoice.
If you mark up expenses, such as phone calls and postage, the Expenses tab lets 
you track your markups. In the “Markup Amount or %” box, type the markup’s 
dollar value or percentage. Then choose the income account for the markup. (The 
box on page 258 tells you how to apply different markups to different expenses.)
To have QuickBooks calculate sales tax, turn on the “Selected expenses are 
taxable” checkbox. (If the customer is tax exempt, QuickBooks doesn’t add 
sales tax even if you turn on this checkbox.)
 NOTE 	 On the Expenses tab, the Memo column displays what you typed in the Memo field of the original 
vendor bill, check, or credit card charge. QuickBooks uses the entries in this column as the description on the 
invoice. (You can’t edit the Memo text in this dialog box. So, if you didn’t enter a Memo in the original expense 
transaction, you’ll have to type the description for each expense after QuickBooks adds it to the invoice in 
step 6.)
4.	 Click the Mileage tab and select any mileage you want to add to the invoice.
Click Options to tell QuickBooks whether to show one line for mileage or a 
separate line for each trip, like you did on the Time tab (Figure 10-18).
5.	 On the Items tab, select the products you bought specifically for this cus­
tomer or job that you want to add to this invoice.
Click an item’s checkmark cell to add it to the invoice.
6.	 When you’ve selected all the billable items you want to add, click OK.
QuickBooks closes the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box and adds 
all the items you selected to the invoice, as shown in Figure 10-20. If it looks 
good, click Save & Close. If not, edit the invoice to include what you want or 
click Clear to start from scratch.
Creating a Batch of Time and Expenses Invoices
If you have QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise and your company is set to use a single 
currency (page 656), you can create time and expenses invoices for more than one 
customer or job. Here are the steps:
1.	 Choose Customers→“Invoice for Time & Expenses” or, on the Home Page, 
click the Invoices icon and then, on the drop-down menu, choose “Invoice 
for Time & Expenses.”
The “Invoice for Time & Expenses” window shows all the customers with out­
standing billable time and expenses and includes a checkmark column on the 
left side of the table.

FIGURE 10-20
You can edit the item descriptions in the Create 
Invoices window. If you didn’t type memos in the 
original expense transactions, you have to type the 
descriptions for billable expenses directly into the 
Description fields here. 
Because the invoice is open in the Create Invoices 
window, you can also add additional line items to 
it before you save it.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Adding Different Markups to Billable Expenses
The Expenses tab of the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” 
dialog box has only one “Markup Amount or %” box, which 
might seem like a problem if you add different markups to 
some of your billable expenses. But there’s nothing stopping 
you from adding these expenses to your invoice in more than 
one batch with a different markup amount or percentage for 
each batch. Here’s how:
1.	 In the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box, click 
the Expenses tab.
2.	 In the “Markup Amount or %” box, type the markup for 
the first batch of expenses.
3.	 Turn on the checkmark cell for each expense that you want 
to apply that markup to.
4.	 Click OK to add the selected expenses to the invoice.
5.	 On the Create Invoices window’s Main tab, click Add 
Time/Costs. 
6.	 In the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box, click 
the Expenses tab.
7.	 Change the value in the “Markup Amount or %” box to 
the next markup value, turn on the checkmark cell for 
the expenses that use this markup, and then click OK to 
close the dialog box.
8.	 Repeat steps 5–7 for each additional markup.
This technique works just as well when some of the expenses 
are taxable and others aren’t. Simply choose the taxable items, 
turn on the “Selected expenses are taxable” checkbox, and 
then add the taxable expenses to the invoice. Next, reopen 
the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box, choose the 
nontaxable items, turn off the “Selected expenses are taxable” 
checkbox, and then add the nontaxable expenses to the invoice.

2.	 In the Date Range From and To boxes, select the date range you want.
3.	 To select several customers or jobs, click the checkmark cells for the ones 
you want, or click Select All.
When a customer or job is selected, a checkmark appears in the checkmark 
column, as shown in Figure 10-21.

5.	 To specify the options for the invoices, click Edit Options below the table. 
Choose the settings you want, and then click OK.
Like the “Options for Transferring Billable Time” dialog box shown in Figure 10-
18, the “Options for Transferring Billables” dialog box has options for showing 
time for each activity on separate invoice lines or showing the total hours for 
each Service item. If each activity is on its own line, you can transfer descrip­
tions, notes, or both to the invoice. You can also specify a markup percentage 
and account for expenses.
6.	 Back in the “Batch Invoice for Time & Expenses” dialog box, if you want to 
look at the details for a customer or job, click Review Billables.
In the “Review Billable Time and Costs” dialog box, click the down arrow to the 
right of the “Time and Costs For” box, and then choose a customer or job. The 
dialog box’s table shows the billable info for that customer or job. When you’re 
done reviewing this info, click OK to close the dialog box.
7.	 Click Create Invoices.
QuickBooks creates the invoices for the selected customers. The Time & Ex­
penses Summary dialog box appears and shows how many invoices are set up 
to print and how many to email, based on your customers’ preferred delivery 
methods (page 76). Click Print to print the invoices marked to print; click Email to

Checking for Unbilled Costs
Most Customers & Receivables reports focus on charges you’ve already invoiced. 
Forgetting to invoice customers for reimbursable costs takes a bite out of your profits. 
So be sure to regularly run the Unbilled Costs by Job report (Reports→Customers 
& Receivables→Unbilled Costs by Job) to look for expenses that you’ve forgotten 
to invoice. This report shows costs that you designated as billable to a customer or 
job but haven’t yet added to an invoice.
Invoicing for Backordered Products
Placing a product order to fulfill your customers’ orders is known as a backorder. 
If backorders are a regular part of your business day, you should consider finding 
suppliers who deliver more quickly and maybe upgrading to QuickBooks Premier 
or Enterprise, which have a built-in sales order form for tracking backordered items. 
If you have QuickBooks Pro, you can handle backorders using pending invoices.
When you tell customers that a product is out of stock, they might ask you to handle 
the backorders in different ways. Here are the most common requests for backorders:
• Remove the backordered items from the order. Customers in a hurry may ask 
you to fill the order with only the products you have in stock. If they can’t find 
the backordered products anywhere else, they can call in a new order.
• Ship all items at once. If convenience is more important than speed, you can 
hold the customer’s order until the backordered products arrive, and then ship 
the whole order at once.
• Ship backordered items when they arrive. Many customers request that you 
process their orders for the products you do have in stock, and then send the 
backordered products when you receive them.
If your customer wants you to remove backordered items from an order, then you 
can remove the backordered items from the invoice, send it to the customer im­
mediately, and ship the rest of the order. But when customers ask you to hold all or 
part of their orders until backordered products arrive, they usually expect you to 
invoice them for backordered products only when you ship them. If that’s the case, 
you don’t want the income appearing in your account balances until the order ships. 
This section describes two ways to handle this situation.

BACKORDERED 
PRODUCTS
 TIP 	 If you need help remembering how customers want you to handle their backorders, store backorder 
preferences in a custom field in customer records (page 78). An alternative approach is to add a note in the 
Customer Center (select the customer, and then click the Notes tab). When you choose a customer in the Create 
Invoices window, the Notes section on the right side displays notes you’ve added to the customer’s record (see 
Figure 10-22).
Using Pending Invoices for Backorders
If you don’t have QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, a pending invoice is the way to 
track backorders. In QuickBooks, setting an invoice’s status to Pending places it in a 
holding pattern with no income or expenses posting to your accounts. Such invoices 
are easy to spot in the Create Invoices window—they sport a “Pending” stamp.
To set an invoice to pending status, follow these steps:
1.	 Press Ctrl+I to open the Create Invoices window.
Fill in the invoice fields as usual (page 226).
2.	 On the Create Invoices window’s Main tab, click Mark As Pending (or right-
click the Create Invoices window, and then choose Mark Invoice As Pending 
from the shortcut menu).
QuickBooks adds a “Pending/non-posting” stamp to the invoice, as shown in 
the background of Figure 10-22.
3.	 Click Save & Close.
The invoice is ready for action, but none of its values post to any accounts.
4.	 When the backordered products arrive, open the invoice in the Create In­
voices window (choose Reports→Sales→Pending Sales, and then double-
click the invoice to open it). In the window’s Main tab, click Mark As Final 
(see Figure 10-22), and then click Save & Close.
QuickBooks posts the invoice’s values to the appropriate income and expense 
accounts.
Using Sales Orders for Backorders
QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise include a sales order form that’s perfect for 
backorders. The Create Sales Orders window looks like the Create Invoices window 
except that the item table includes an Ordered column, which holds the number of 
items the customer ordered but that you haven’t yet invoiced. In effect, it’s a record 
of how much stock you need to have on hand to fill the order.
 TIP 	 To see all your sales orders at once, choose Reports→Sales, and then select either Open Sales Orders 
by Customer or Open Sales Orders by Item.

In addition to backorders, 
pending invoices are also 
great for entering transac-
tions ahead of time and 
holding them until you 
receive approval for a sale 
or reach the milestone that 
the invoice represents. You 
can set sales receipts and 
credit memos to pending 
status as well. 
To see all your pend-
ing sales, choose 
Reports→Sales→Pending 
Sales to run the report 
shown in the foreground 
here.
If you try to add more items to an invoice than you have in stock, you’ll see an error 
message warning of the shortfall. QuickBooks Pro simply warns you that you don’t 
have enough. But in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise, the message box tells you 
how many you have on hand, how many are on other sales orders, and the remaining 
quantity available, as shown in Figure 10-23. (For example, if you have two items on 
hand and two on other sales orders, the quantity available is 0.) When you see this 
message, click OK to close the message box, and then click Clear to cancel the invoice. 
If you already know that your inventory is woefully low or nonexistent (and you use 
QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise), simply create a sales order for the customer’s 
order. Then you can create a partial invoice for the items you do have in stock and 
use the sales order to track the backordered items. Since QuickBooks keeps a run­
ning balance of backordered items based on your sales orders, you can easily create 
a purchase order to restock the products you need. (See Chapter 20 to learn more 
about managing inventory.) Here’s how to create a sales order for backordered items:

The only difference is that the column where you record the quantity of items 
you’re ordering is labeled “Ordered” instead of “Quantity.”
4.	 If some of the items the customer ordered are in stock, on the Create Sales 
Orders window’s Main tab, click Create Invoice.

After you receive the items you ordered, return to step 4 to create a final invoice 
from the sales order.
Selling Products on Consignment
Selling products on consignment involves two participants: a consignor who 
gives products to someone else to sell and a consignee who sells the consigner’s 
products. Unlike the regular process for selling products, in consignment sales, no 
money changes hands when consignors hand over products to consignees. When 
consignees actually sell consignment items, they keep their commissions and pay 
the consignors the rest of the sales price.
Consignors and consignees each have their respective challenges tracking money 
and consignment items on hand. This section explains the setup and transactions 
you perform for both sides of consignment sales.
Consigning Products to Someone Else to Sell
As a consignor, you need to keep track of the products you give to someone else to 
sell, as well as how much money you should receive when the consignee sells some of 
your items. In QuickBooks, sales orders are the way to track consignment goods that 
are sitting in someone else’s store or warehouse—so you need QuickBooks Premier 
or Enterprise (remember, QuickBooks Pro doesn’t include sales orders). This section 
describes the setup you need to perform as a consignor and the transactions you 
record to track your consignment items until they’re sold and you receive your money.
Here are the accounts and items you need to track products you give to others on 
consignment:
• An Other Current Asset account to track the value of your consignment 
inventory. You create this account so you can differentiate your consignment 
inventory from inventory you have in your own warehouse or store. Follow the 
steps on page 56 to open the Add New Account window. There, in the Other 
Account Types drop-down list, choose Other Current Asset, and then click Con­
tinue. In the Account Name box, type a name, such as Inventory on Consignment. 
(See page 57 to learn how to fill in the other fields.) Finally, click Save & Close.
• A parent item for your inventory that’s on consignment. Create a new Inven­
tory Part item (page 519). In the Item Name/Number box, type something like 
Consignment Items. In the Income Account box, choose an income account, 
such as Product Revenue (or you can create an income account specifically 
for consignment sales). In the Asset Account box, choose the Other Current 
Asset account you created in the previous bullet point, and then click OK to 
save the item.
• Subitems for each type of consignment item you give to consignees. The 
easiest way to create consignment subitems is to duplicate your regular in­
ventory items and tweak the duplicates. To do that, in the Item List window 

Chapter 10: Invoicing
267
SELLING 
PRODUCTS ON 
CONSIGNMENT
(Lists→Item List), right-click the inventory item you’re going to consign, and 
then choose Duplicate Item on the shortcut menu. QuickBooks opens the New 
Item window and fills in the fields with the values from the original item. (The 
program adds “DUP” to the beginning of the item’s name.) In the Item Name/
Number box, delete “DUP” and append the word “Consignment” to the end of 
the name. Next, turn on the Subitem Of checkbox and, in the drop-down list 
below it, choose the parent item you created in the previous bullet point. Change 
the Asset Account field to the consignment inventory account you created in 
the first bullet point. If necessary, change the Income Account to the account 
you want to use for consignment income. And if the price the consignee pays 
is different than your regular price, edit the value in the Sales Price box. When 
everything looks good, click OK to save the new consignment inventory subitem.
Now your Item List includes a separate parent item for consignment inventory with 
the consignment subitems indented beneath it.
WHEN YOU DELIVER PRODUCTS TO CONSIGNEES
When you send products to consignees, your records need to reflect that some of 
your inventory is in others’ warehouses. To do that, you first record an inventory 
adjustment to switch some of your regular inventory on hand to consignment in­
ventory on hand. Then you create sales orders to record the products you’ve given 
to each consignee.
Here’s how you record an inventory adjustment to reclassify the inventory you give 
to a consignee as consignment inventory:
1.	 Choose Vendors→Inventory Activities→Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand.
The Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand dialog box opens. Leave the Adjustment 
Type box set to Quantity. Because you’re changing regular inventory items to 
consignment items, the total value of your inventory doesn’t change, so you 
don’t need to change this setting to Total Value.
2.	 In the Adjustment Account box, choose an expense account (such as Sup­
plies or Materials) or an Other Expense account.
The adjustment value is zero, so you can choose any expense account you want. 
It’s a good idea to select an account related to product expenses.
3.	 In the table, fill in the first Item cell with the regular inventory item, and 
then, in the next row’s Item cell, choose the corresponding consignment 
inventory item, as shown in Figure 10-26.
4.	 In the regular item’s Qty Difference cell, type a negative number. In the 
consignment item’s Qty Difference cell, type a positive number.
Typing a negative number for the regular item reduces your regular inventory 
item’s quantity on hand. The consignment item’s positive number adds that 
quantity of items to your consignment inventory on hand.

Typing a negative number 
in a regular inventory 
item’s Qty Difference cell 
reduces the number of 
regular inventory items on 
hand, so you have fewer 
to sell directly to your cus-
tomers. A positive number 
in a consignment inven-
tory item’s Qty Difference 
cell increases the number 
of consignment inventory 
items on hand—at your 
consignees’ locations.
5.	 Click OK to save the adjustment.
Now you can look at the Item List window’s Total Quantity column to see the number 
of regular and consignment inventory items you have.
You also need to tell QuickBooks how many items you give to each consignee. 
That’s where a sales order comes into play. Here’s how to record a sales order for 
consignment items you send out:
1.	 In QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, on the Home Page, click Sales Orders. 
In the Sales Orders window, choose the person or company who is selling 
goods on consignment for you.
You have to set up your consignees as customers (page 70) so they appear in 
the Sales Orders window’s Name drop-down list.
2.	 In the Date box, choose the date that you sent (or will send) goods to the 
consignee.
3.	 Fill in each line of the table (page 236) with the items and quantities that 
you’re sending to the consignee.
That way, when the consignee sells some of the products, you can create an 
invoice for him directly from the sales order. Doing this also puts the consign­
ment inventory in your consignment-inventory asset account.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save & Close.
This sales order actually does double duty. It not only provides a record of the con­
signment items the “customer” (a.k.a. consignee) has on hand; if you use Inventory

Part items for your consigned goods as described on page 266, it also moves the 
value of the consignment inventory into your consignment-inventory asset account.
WHEN CONSIGNEES SELL YOUR STUFF
If your consignees sell some of your consignment items, you can give a quick whoop 
of joy before you create an invoice for what the consignee owes you. In fact, you 
can whoop a second time, because you can easily create an invoice from the sales 
order you created in the previous section. Here are the steps for creating an invoice 
from a consignment sales order:
1.	 On the Home Page, click Customers. In the Customer Center, click the Cus­
tomers & Jobs tab, and then select the consignee who sold some of your 
consignment goods.
Information and transactions for that customer appear on the window’s right.
2.	 In the pane at the Customer Center’s bottom right, click the Transactions 
tab. In the tab’s Show drop-down list, choose Sales Orders.
QuickBooks displays the sales orders for that customer. If the Transactions 
tab is rife with sales orders, in the Filter By drop-down list, choose Open Sales 
Orders. In the Date drop-down list, you can choose a date range, such as This 
Fiscal Quarter.
3.	 Double-click the sales order associated with the sold consignment items.
The sales order opens in the Create Sales Order window.
4.	 At the top of the window, click Create Invoice. In the Create Invoice Based 
on Sales Order(s) dialog box, select the “Create invoice for selected items” 
option, and then click OK.
The Specify Items and Quantities for Invoice dialog box opens. All the items 
from the sales order appear in the table.
5.	 In the To Invoice cell for each consignment item, type the number of items 
the consignee sold, and then click OK.
The Create Invoices window opens with a new invoice already filled in with the 
consignee’s info, as well as the items and quantities sold (see Figure 10-27). 
6.	 In the Create Invoices window, click Save & Close.
QuickBooks jumps into action behind the scenes: it reduces the number of 
consignment inventory items on hand, on sales orders, and available. It also 
reduces the balance in your consignment inventory asset account and moves 
that money into your Accounts Receivable account to show what your consignee 
owes you. To see the number of consignment items sold by each consignee, you 
can run the Sales by Customer Detail report (see page 593).

ance for the consignee.
Selling Consignment Goods Received from Someone Else
As a consignee, you have to track the consignment goods you have on hand. And 
when you sell consignment items, you have to track your earnings as well as what 
you owe the consignors. To wrap up the process, you need to pay consignors their 
share of the revenue.
You don’t pay anything up front for goods you sell on consignment. When you sell 
these items, you keep a percentage of the sales revenue as a commission and pay 
the consignor the rest. You need to keep track of how many consignment items you 
receive, how many you’ve sold, and how many you still have on hand. This section 
guides you through setting up QuickBooks so you can sell vendors’ products on 
consignment and through creating the transactions you record to handle consign­
ment sales from start to finish.
Here are the accounts and items you need to track products you sell as a consignee:
• An Other Current Liability account to track what you owe the consignor. This 
account will track how much you owe the consignor for consignment items you 
sell. (See page 56 for info on creating accounts.) Name the account something 
like Consignment Sales - Liability.
• An Income account to track your sales commission. This account tracks 
how much you make from selling consignment items. Name it something like 
Consignment Commission.
• A Service item for deducting your commission from what you owe the 
consignor. Create a Service item (page 108) called something like Commission 
Deduction. In the New Item dialog box’s Description field, type a description, 

Chapter 10: Invoicing
271
SELLING 
PRODUCTS ON 
CONSIGNMENT
such as “Reduce liability for commission earned on sale.” In the Rate field, type 
a negative percentage that represents your commission on a consignment sale. 
For example, if you take 30 percent of the sales price, type -30% in the box. In 
the Account box, choose the Other Current Liability account you created to track 
what you owe the consignor. That way, when you record the sale, QuickBooks 
deducts your commission from what you owe the consignor. 
• A Service item for your commission income. This Service item gets your in­
come into the right place in your chart of accounts. Name this item something 
like Commission Income. In the New Item dialog box’s Description field, type 
a more thorough description, such as “Commission on consignment sale.” In 
the Rate field, type your commission percentage as a positive number, such as 
30%. In the Account drop-down list, choose the income account you created 
to track your consignment income (Consignment Commission, in this example).
• A parent Inventory Part item for your consignment inventory. You’ll use this 
Inventory Part item to track all the consignment goods you sell. Call it something 
like Consignment Goods - Held. Link this item to the basic COGS account that 
QuickBooks creates when you create your first inventory item (page 519). In 
the New Item dialog box’s Income Account box, choose the Other Current Li­
ability account you created to track what you owe the consignor (Consignment 
Sales – Liability, in this example). In the Asset Account box, choose the asset 
account you use to track inventory.
• Subitems for each category of consignment item you sell. Create Inventory 
Part subitems for each type of consignment item you receive from consignors 
(see Figure 10-28), not for each individual consignment item. For example, say 
you sell miniature cameras on consignment. Create one subitem to track them 
and name it something descriptive like “Camera Tiny – Consigned.” Be sure to 
turn on the “Subitem of” checkbox and, in the drop-down list below it, choose 
the Consignment Goods – Held parent item. Leave the Cost field set to 0.00, 
since you don’t pay anything for a consignment item up front. In the Sales Price 
field, enter the price you sell the product for. In the Asset Account box, choose 
your inventory asset account.
To track items by consignor, set up a custom field called Consignor, and link 
it to the Item List. (See page 78 to learn how to set up custom fields for lists.) 
Then, in the Consignor field, for each Inventory Part subitem you create for 
consignment items, type the consignor’s name.
 NOTE 	 If you sell scads of unique consignment items, creating an Inventory Part item for each one would fill 
up your Item List with one-off entries. Instead, create a single Non-inventory Part item and call it something like 
Consignment Items. In the New Item dialog box, turn on the “This item is used in assemblies or is purchased for 
a specific customer:job” checkbox. Keep both the Cost and Sale Price fields set to 0.00. In the Expense Account 
drop-down list, choose the asset account you created to track your consignment inventory (Inventory Asset, 
in this example). And in the Income Account drop-down list, choose the income account you use to track your 
consignment income (Consignment Commission, in this example).

you track how many

account. By using the Con-
signment Sales - Liability 
account as the Income 
account, you’ll be able to 
see how much you owe 
consignors for consign-
ment products you sell.
• A Group item for each consignment subitem you created per the previous 
bullet point. There’s a lot to keep track of when you sell consignment goods. This 
Group item (see Figure 10-29) moves consignment money to the right accounts 
and tracks how many you have on hand. When creating this Group item in the 
New Item dialog box, you add the consigned item to the first line in the Item table 
and set the Qty cell to 1. That way, when you sell an item, QuickBooks takes care 
of reducing the number of this item that you have on hand. The second line in 
the Item table is the Service item for your commission (Consignment Commis­
sion, in this example). And the third item is the Service item you use to deduct 
your commission from what you owe the consignor (Commission Deduction, in 
this example). By adding these two lines to the group, when you sell an item, 
QuickBooks adds your commission to your commission income account and the 
remainder of the money to the Other Current Liability account that tracks what 
you owe the consignor. Keep the “Print items in group” checkbox turned off so 
the Group item is the only thing customers see on invoices and sales receipts.

ADDING CONSIGNMENT ITEMS TO YOUR INVENTORY
When you receive consignment goods from a consignor, you need to update your 
records to show how many consignment items you have on hand. The easiest way 
to do that is to create a bill for those items. Here are the steps:
1.	 Create a bill for the items you receive on consignment.
On the Home Page, click Enter Bills. In the Enter Bills window’s Vendor field, 
choose the vendor who consigned items to you. In the Date field, choose the 
date you received the items.
2.	 In the Amount Due field, type 0.
Because you don’t pay the vendor for consigned goods until they’re sold, you 
create a bill for $0.
3.	 On the window’s Items tab, fill in the lines with the consignment items and 
quantities you received, as shown in Figure 10-30.
In the first Item cell, select the Inventory Part item you created for the consigned 
item, not the Group item. Fill in that row’s Qty cell with the number of items 
you received. (Because you set up the inventory item with $0 cost, the cost on 
the bill is 0.00.)

goods doesn’t affect the

asks whether you want to record your changes, click Yes.
If a Bill Already Paid message box appears, click OK to close it.

you created for consigned items and check the value in the Total Quantity cells.
RECORDING CONSIGNMENT SALES
When you sell consignment goods, you record the customer invoice almost as you 
do any other invoice. The consignment Group items you add to the invoice are the 
key to tracking your consignment inventory and following the consignment money 
trail. However, you need to add the Consignor custom field to your invoice template 
so you can identify which consignor you need to pay for the sold goods.
Here are the steps to adding the Consignor custom field to your invoice template:

1.	 Choose Lists→Templates.
The Templates window opens.
2.	 Click the template you want to use as a basis for your consignment template 
(for example, a custom invoice template you set up for your company), and 
then, at the bottom of the Templates window, click Templates→Duplicate. 
The Select Template dialog box appears.
3.	 In the Select Template Type dialog box, select the Invoice option, and then 
click OK.
The copy appears in the Templates list with the words “Copy of” at the begin­
ning of its name.
4.	 Right-click the new template and choose Edit Template from the shortcut 
menu.
To rename the template, in the Basic Customization dialog box, click Manage 
Templates. In the Template Name field on the dialog box’s right, type a new 
name, such as Consignment Sales, and then click OK.
5.	 At the bottom of the Basic Customization dialog box, click Additional Cus­
tomization. In the additional Customization dialog box that appears, click 
the Columns tab.
The Columns tab includes fields that appear in the item table.
6.	 Below the Screen heading, turn on the Consignor checkbox (you’ll see this 
checkbox only if you created a Consignor custom field and associated it 
with the Item List, as described on page 271). 
That way, the Consignor field will appear in the item table when you’re filling 
out the invoice onscreen, but it won’t appear on the invoice that the customer 
receives.
7.	 Click OK to close the Additional Customization dialog box, and then click 
OK again to close the Basic Customization dialog box.
Your custom template for consignment sales is now ready to use. Here’s how you 
record a consignment sale:
1.	 Create an invoice for the sale by choosing Customers→Create Invoices.
Fill in the Customer:Job, Class, Date, and other header fields the way you do 
for a regular invoice. In the Template field, choose the custom template you just 
created (the one you made by following the steps in the numbered list above).
2.	 In the first item cell, choose the Group item you created for the consign­
ment item you sold. In the Quantity cell, fill in the number that you sold 
(see Figure 10-31).

QuickBooks automatically adds the Group item’s underlying line items to the 
invoice. (Remember, these lines won’t appear on the printed invoice, because 
you turned off the “Print items in group” checkbox when you created the Group 
item [page 272].) When you change the Quantity cell on the Group item’s line, 
QuickBooks automatically changes the quantities on the other lines. (To see 
what the invoice or sales receipt looks like, at the top of the transaction window, 
click Print→Preview.)
FIGURE 10-31
When you record an 
invoice or sales receipt 
for consigned items, 
QuickBooks decreases the 
number of consignment 
items you have in your 
inventory. The Group 
item also takes care of 
recording your portion of 
the sales revenue in your 
income account and the 
consignor’s portion in the 
liability account you use 
to track what you owe 
consignors. 
3.	 In each line below the Group item, click the Consignor cell and type the 
name of the consignor.
In the next section, you’ll learn how to use this field to create a report that shows 
what you owe each consignor.
4.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each type of consignment item you sold. When 
you’re done, click Save & Close.
When you save the invoice, QuickBooks does several things behind the scenes. 
It decreases the quantity on hand for the consignment items you sold and posts 
the income to the Consignment Sales - Liability account (which tracks what you 
owe consignors). It also deducts your commission from that account and puts 
the money in your Commission Income account. 
PAYING CONSIGNORS
The last step in the consignment process is paying consignors their portion of the 
sales revenue. You can use the Consignor custom field to create a report that shows 
you how much you owe each consignor. Then all you have to do is write a check.
Here’s how to customize a report to show consignor liabilities:

1.	 Choose Reports→Custom Reports→Transaction Detail. In the Dates drop-
down list, choose the period you want to pay consignors for, such as Last 
Month.
The Modify Report window opens automatically when you create a custom 
report.
2.	 In the Modify Report window, in the Display tab’s Columns list, click the 
Consignor entry (you may have to scroll down to see it).
Doing this makes the Consigner field appear as a column in the report.
3.	 Click the Filters tab and, in the Filter list on the left, choose Item. In the Item 
drop-down list that appears, choose “Multiple items.” In the Select Item 
dialog box that appears, click the Commission Deduction item and each 
consignment Inventory Part item you sell, and then click OK.
This filter limits the report to transactions related to your consignment items.
4.	 Back on the Modify Report dialog box’s Filters tab, in the Filter list on the 
left, choose Account. Then, in the Account drop-down list, choose the 
Other Current Liability account you set up to track what you owe consignors 
(Consignment Sales – Liability, in this example).
5.	 In the Filter list on the left, click Consignor, and then type the name of the 
consignor you want to pay. Click OK to run the report.
The total at the bottom of the report’s Amount column is what you owe the 
consignor.
 TIP 	 To memorize this custom report so you can run it in the future, press Ctrl+M. In the Memorize Report 
dialog box, in the Name box, type a name for the report, such as Consignment Payments, and then click OK. To 
run the memorized report, choose Reports→Memorized Reports→[name of report].
Now you can use that amount to write a check to the consignor. Here’s how:
1.	 On the Home Page, click Write Checks.
The Write Checks window opens.
2.	 In the “Pay to the Order of” box, choose the vendor who is your consignor.
To provide more information about the sale, type details in the Memo field.
3.	 On the Expenses tab near the bottom of the window, in the first Account 
cell, choose the Consignment Sales - Liability account.
4.	 If you want to print the check, turn o n the Print Later checkbox. If you hand-
write checks, simply click Save & Close.
The check reduces your liability to the consignor. To confirm that you’ve paid the 
consignor what you owe, on the Home Page, click Vendors. In the Vendor Center 
window, on the Vendors tab, the Balance for the vendor should be zero.

Estimating Jobs
Many customers ask for an estimate before hiring you. If you’re good with numbers, 
you might total up the costs in your head and scribble the estimate on a napkin. But 
creating estimates in QuickBooks not only generates a more professional-looking 
estimate; it also feeds numbers into the invoices you create as you perform work for 
customers. When you create an estimate in QuickBooks, you add the items you’ll 
sell or deliver and set the markup on those items.
 NOTE 	 The estimate feature needs to be turned on before you can create estimates in QuickBooks. Choose 
Edit→Preferences→Jobs & Estimates, and then click the Company Preferences tab. In the “Do You Create 
Estimates?” section, make sure that Yes is selected, and then click OK.
QuickBooks estimates make short work of pricing time and materials for small 
jobs. But QuickBooks estimating isn’t for every business. Particularly if you work in 
construction, where a major project might require hundreds or even thousands of 
items, you definitely don’t want to enter all the data you’d need to build the Item List 
for your project. That’s why most construction firms turn to third-party estimating 
programs that come with databases of the services and products you need. Many of 
these programs integrate with QuickBooks, which means you can import an estimate 
you created in another program (see Chapter 26) and use it to produce your invoices.
 NOTE 	 The totals on estimates don’t post to accounts in your chart of accounts. After all, an estimate doesn’t 
mean that your customer has committed to going ahead with the job. Estimates show the potential value of a 
job without showing up in your financial reports. When the preference for estimates is turned on (page 655), 
QuickBooks automatically creates a non-posting account called Estimates, where it stores estimate values. (If 
you use account numbers [page 635], its number is 4.)
Creating an Estimate
If you’ve mastered QuickBooks’ invoices, you’ll feel right at home with the fields that 
appear in a QuickBooks estimate. Figure 10-32 shows the Create Estimates window.
Here’s how to create an estimate and handle the small differences between invoices 
and estimates:
1.	 On the Home Page, click the Estimates icon, or choose Customers→Create 
Estimates.
QuickBooks opens the Create Estimates window. Depending on which edition 
of QuickBooks you have, the program may choose a different estimate tem­
plate from the one shown in Figure 10-32. If you’ve created your own estimate 
template (page 707), choose it from the Template drop-down list (QuickBooks 
automatically uses your custom template from then on).

Chapter 10: Invoicing

ESTIMATING 
JOBS
FIGURE 10-32
QuickBooks automatically 
makes the estimates you 
create active, which means 
you can experiment with 
several and then build 
your invoices from the one 
your customer approves. 
To make an estimate 
inactive, on the Create 
Estimates window’s Main 
tab, click Mark As Inactive.
2.	 As you would for an invoice, build your estimate by adding items to the 
line-item table (page 236).
In a blank line in the table, in the Item drop-down list, choose the item that you 
want to add to the estimate. When you fill in the quantity, QuickBooks uses 
the cost and sales price from the item’s record to fill in the Cost, Amount, and 
Total cells.
The markup percentage that QuickBooks fills in is based on how much you pay 
for the item and the sales price you charge. If you want to apply a different 
markup percentage, click the item’s Markup cell, and then either type the per­
centage you want to use or choose a price level (page 235) from the drop-down 
list. From then on, the markup is visible only while you work on the estimate. 
When you print the estimate or email it to your customer, only the Cost and 
Total columns appear in the form.
 NOTE 	 The calculated value in an item’s Total cell isn’t set in stone. If you change the Total value, QuickBooks 
recalculates the markup percentage for you. Likewise, if you change the percentage in the Markup cell, QuickBooks 
recalculates the value in the Total cell.
3.	 To email the estimate to your customer later, on the window’s Main tab, 
turn on the Email Later checkbox.
QuickBooks queues up the estimate so you can email it later (page 318). For 
reasons unknown, you can’t queue up an estimate to print later. If you want to

print an estimate, in the Create Estimates window’s Main tab, click Print, and 
then choose Estimate on the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can choose 
Print→Save As PDF, and then print the PDF later.
4.	 When the estimate is complete, click Save & Close to save it and close the 
Create Estimates window.
After you’ve created an estimate and printed it or emailed it to your customer, 
you don’t do much with it until the customer gives you the nod for the job.
Creating Multiple Estimates
Whether you’re creating a second estimate because the customer thought the first 
price was too high or creating another estimate with the add-ons the customer has 
requested, it’s easy to build and manage several estimates for the same job. You’ve 
got the following methods at your disposal:
• Creating an estimate. You can create additional estimates for a job simply by 
creating a new estimate as described in the previous section. When you cre­
ate additional estimates, QuickBooks makes them active so they appear in the 
Available Estimates dialog box (page 283) when you choose the corresponding 
customer in the Create Invoices window. Active estimates also appear in the 
Estimates by Job report (Reports→Jobs, Time & Mileage→Estimates by Job) 
shown in Figure 10-33.
FIGURE 10-33
If you have too many 
estimates to find the right 
one by clicking the Create 
Estimate window’s Previ-

This report includes 
an Estimate Active 
column, which contains a 
checkmark if the estimate 
is active. Double-click 
anywhere in a line to open 
that estimate in the Create 
Estimates window.

• Duplicating an estimate. If you want to play what-if games with an existing 
estimate, you can duplicate it and then make your adjustments. In the Create 
Estimates window, display the estimate you want to copy and then, on the Main 
tab, click “Create a Copy” or right-click the estimate and choose Duplicate Es­
timate from the shortcut menu. Either way, QuickBooks pulls everything from 
the existing estimate onto a new one and assigns it the next estimate number 
in sequence. After you make the changes you want, click Save & Close or Save & 
New. (The box on page 282 tells you how to create boilerplate estimates, which 
is faster if you intend to duplicate an estimate frequently.)
• Finding an estimate. When you know the estimate you want exists, you can 
search for it based on the customer or job, when you created it, its number, or 
the amount. On the Create Estimates window’s Main tab, click Find or right-click 
in the window and then choose Find Estimates from the shortcut menu. In the 
Find Estimates dialog box that appears, fill in what you know about the estimate, 
and then click Find. If you click Advanced, QuickBooks opens the full-blown 
Find window so you can set more specific criteria (page 333).
• Making an estimate inactive. When you create several estimates for the same 
work, eventually you and your customer will pick one to run with. Once you’ve 
picked an estimate, make the others inactive. To do that, display an estimate in 
the Create Estimates window and then, on the Main tab, click Mark As Inactive. 
Then click Save & New to save the estimate while keeping the Create Estimates 
window open. If you want to make another estimate inactive, on the Main tab, 
click the left arrow (Previous) or the right arrow (Next) until the estimate in 
question appears, and then repeat these steps.
QuickBooks won’t display inactive estimates in the Available Estimates dialog 
box (page 283), but you still have a record of them, which you can see by click­
ing the Next or Previous arrow on the Create Estimates window’s Main tab, or 
by running the Estimates by Job report.
• Deleting an estimate. Deleting an estimate isn’t the no-no that deleting an 
invoice is. (The only risk is that you’ll realize you wanted to keep the estimate 
as soon as you delete it.) In the Create Estimates window, display the estimate 
you want to axe and then, on the Main tab, click Delete. Alternatively, right-click 
the estimate in the Create Estimates window and then choose Delete Estimate 
from the shortcut menu. In the Delete Transaction dialog box, click OK to get 
rid of the estimate.
 NOTE 	 To protect profit margins from being nibbled away by small changes, many businesses keep track 
of every change that a customer requests (called change orders). The Contractor and Accountant editions of 
QuickBooks let you track change orders on estimates.

Building Boilerplate Estimates
Suppose you’ve put a lot of thought into the typical tasks 
you perform and the materials you need for different types 
of jobs. Creating boilerplate estimates that take into account 
your performance on similar, completed jobs helps you quickly 
produce estimates for new jobs. Your new customer will be 
impressed by your speedy response, and you’ll be confident 
that you haven’t forgotten anything.
To create a boilerplate estimate, build an estimate with all the 
information you reuse, and then have QuickBooks memorize 
it. Here’s how:
1.	 In the Create Estimates window, fill in all the fields and line 
items you want in the boilerplate estimate. If you want 
to capture the items you use but not the quantities, in 
the line-item table, leave the quantity (Qty) cells blank.
2.	 To memorize the estimate, press Ctrl+M or right-click the 
estimate and then choose Memorize Estimate from the 
shortcut menu. You can also click Memorize on the Create 
Estimates window’s Main tab.
3.	 QuickBooks tells you that it will remove the Customer: 
Job so you can use the memorized estimate for any 
customer. Click OK to dismiss the message. 
4.	 In the Memorize Transaction dialog box, type a name 
for the estimate, such as Dinner Dance for a boilerplate 
estimate for a fancy soiree. And because you’ll use this 
estimate only when you get a similar job, choose the Do 
Not Remind Me option.
5.	 Click OK to add the estimate to your Memorized Transaction 
List.
That’s all there is to it. To use your boilerplate estimate to bid 
on a similar job, press Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transac-
tion List window (or choose Lists→Memorized Transaction 
List). Double-click the memorized estimate to open the Create 
Estimates window with the memorized estimate’s information 
displayed; QuickBooks fills in the current date and the next 
estimate number in the sequence. In the Customer:Job box, 
choose the new customer. Make any other changes you want, 
and then click Save & Close.
Creating an Invoice from an Estimate
Whether you create one estimate for a job or several, you can generate invoices 
from your estimates. In fact, if you open the Create Invoices window and choose 
a customer or job for which estimates exist, QuickBooks displays the Available 
Estimates dialog box, which lists all the active estimates for that customer or job.
 NOTE 	 This section explains how to turn an entire estimate into an invoice. See page 284 to learn how to 
use estimates to generate progress invoices when you reach milestones on large projects.

Chapter 10: Invoicing

JOBS
To use an estimate to create an invoice, do the following:
1.	 Press Ctrl+I to open the Create Invoices window and then, in the Customer:Job 
drop-down list, choose the customer or job you want to invoice.
If one or more estimates exist for that customer or job, the Available Estimates 
dialog box opens, listing the active estimates for that customer or job, as shown 
in Figure 10-34.
 NOTE 	 You don’t have to use your estimate to create an invoice if, say, you want to invoice for your actual 
time and materials. In that situation, click Cancel. The Available Estimates dialog box closes, and you can fill in 
the Create Invoices window’s line-item table.
FIGURE 10-34

sure to choose the estimate that 
she accepted. The Available Esti-

estimate.
2.	 In the Available Estimates dialog box, click anywhere in the row for the 
estimate you want, and then click OK.
The Create Progress Invoice Based On Estimate dialog box appears with the 
“Create invoice for the entire estimate (100%)” option selected.
3.	 Click OK.
QuickBooks opens the Create Invoices window and fills in the information from 
the estimate.
4.	 Make any changes you want and then click Save & Close.
You’re done!
Comparing Estimates to Actuals
Customers who write you blank checks are rare, so most jobs require estimates of 
what the work will cost. When you finish a job that you estimated, take some time 
to run the Job Estimates vs. Actuals Summary report (it’s on the Reports→Jobs, 
Time & Mileage submenu) to see how you did compared with your estimate. Do 
this a few times, and the accuracy of your estimates should improve dramatically.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
284
ESTIMATING 
JOBS
If you invoice jobs based on the progress you’ve made (as described in the next 
section), run the Job Progress Invoices vs. Estimates report instead (it’s on the 
Reports→Jobs, Time & Mileage submenu if you have the progress invoicing prefer­
ence [page 655] turned on). It compares your estimate with actual performance 
through your most recent progress invoice.
Creating Progress Invoices
When you work on jobs and projects that take more than a few days, you probably 
don’t want to wait until a job is completely finished to charge for some of your work. 
Progress invoices include charges based on your estimate and the progress you’ve 
made on the job. These invoices are common for jobs that are broken into phases or 
when customers make payments when you reach milestones. Since most large jobs 
start with an estimate, you won’t have to start from scratch when it’s time to invoice 
your customer—QuickBooks can convert your estimate into progress invoices with 
only a few additional pieces of information.
 NOTE 	 Before you can produce progress invoices, you have to turn on the preferences for both creating 
estimates and progress invoicing (page 655).
Progress Invoicing Options
Progress invoices are still invoices; they just happen to link to estimates you’ve cre­
ated for a job. In the Create Invoices window, when you choose a customer or job, 
QuickBooks checks to see if an estimate exists. If there’s at least one estimate for 
that customer or job, QuickBooks opens the Available Estimates dialog box so you 
can choose an estimate to invoice against.
To get started creating a progress invoice, select an estimate in the Available Esti­
mates dialog box, and then click OK; QuickBooks opens the Create Progress Invoice 
Based On Estimate dialog box (Figure 10-35). When you create your first progress 
invoice for a job, this dialog box lets you choose to invoice the entire estimate or 
only a portion. Here are your options and when you might use them:
• Create invoice for the entire estimate (100%). This option is perfect if you 
prepared an estimate to get approval before starting a job and you completed 
the job in a short period of time. QuickBooks takes care of the grunt work of 
transferring all the services, products, and other items from the estimate to 
the invoice.
 NOTE 	 You can edit the invoice amounts that come from an estimate, which is handy if your actual costs were 
higher than your estimate, for instance. However, the contract you signed determines whether your customer will 
actually pay the revised amounts!

Chapter 10: Invoicing
285
CREATING 
PROGRESS 
INVOICES
FIGURE 10-35
The “Create invoice for the 
entire estimate (100%)” 
option is available only 
the first time you create 
a progress invoice for an 
estimated job. After that, 
you have to invoice based 
on a percentage of the 
entire estimate, by picking 
individual items, or for the 
remaining amounts on the 
estimate (that last option 
isn’t shown here).
• Create an invoice for the remaining amounts of the estimate. For every 
progress invoice after the first one for a job, you’ll see this option instead of 
“Create invoice for the entire estimate (100%).” Pick this option when you’re 
ready to create your last invoice for the job. Its sole purpose is to save you the 
hassle of calculating the percentages that you haven’t yet billed.
• Create invoice for a percentage of the entire estimate. Choose this option if 
you negotiated a contract that pays a percentage when you reach a milestone, 
such as 15 percent when the house’s foundation is complete. (Of course, you 
and the customer have to agree that a milestone is complete; QuickBooks can’t 
help you with that.) This option is also handy if your contract specifies a num­
ber of installment payments. In the “% of estimate” box, type the percentage 
you’ve completed.
Don’t use this option if you include inventory on the estimate, because the 
invoice you create might contain fractional quantities of inventory items. For 
example, if you estimate 10 inventory items and then create a progress invoice 
for 33 percent of the job, the invoice will include 3.33 inventory items. You can 
avoid this by using the selected items option (described next) instead.
 TIP 	 Suppose your contract includes a clause that covers cost overruns, and the job ended up costing 20 percent 
more than your estimate. You might wonder how you can charge for that extra 20 percent. The hidden solution 
is that the “% of estimate” box doesn’t limit you to 100 percent. So in this example, you’d type 120 percent for 
the last invoice to reflect the costs that exceeded the estimate.
• Create invoice for selected items or for different percentages of each item. 
This option is the most flexible and a must if you bill customers only for the work 
that’s actually complete. For example, if you’re building an office complex, one

INVOICES
building might be complete while another is still in the framing phase. When 
you select this option, you can choose the services and products to include 
on the invoice and specify different percentages for each one. When you click 
OK, the “Specify Invoice Amounts for Items on Estimate” dialog box appears, 
initially showing your estimated amounts and any previously invoiced amounts. 
The next section tells you how to fill in this dialog box.
Fine-Tuning a Progress Invoice
When you click OK in the Create Progress Invoice Based On Estimate dialog box (or, 
if you chose items to invoice, the “Specify Invoice Amounts for Items on Estimate” 
dialog box), QuickBooks automatically fills in the invoice with the estimate’s items, 
percentages, and amounts, as shown in Figure 10-36. You don’t have to stick with 
the numbers that QuickBooks comes up with—you can reconfigure the charges 
on the invoice any way you want. However, it’s always a good idea to review the 
customer’s contract and get approval before you make any increases or additions 
not covered by the contract.
FIGURE 10-36
When you provide materi-
als for a job, they’re either 
onsite or not. (Assigning 
50 percent to materials 
makes sense only if half 
the boxes made it.) If you 
create an invoice for 25 
percent of the job, you 
can change the invoice 
to cover 100 percent for 
materials by editing the 
values in the “Total %” 
column. 
Changing a “Total %” cell 
also solves the problem 
of one task that’s far 
behind—or far ahead.
You can modify line items directly in a QuickBooks invoice, but that approach doesn’t 
create a record of your changes. If you want to keep a record of the changes you 
make between the estimate and the progress invoice, follow these steps instead:
1.	 Open the progress invoice in the Create Invoices window.
Press Ctrl+I, and then click the window’s left arrow (Previous) button until the 
progress invoice you want appears. You can also open an invoice from the 
Customer Center: On the center’s Customers & Jobs tab, select the customer

you want. Then, on the Transactions tab in the center’s lower right, in the Show 
drop-down list, click Invoices. Finally, double-click the invoice you want to open.
2.	 On the Create Invoices window’s Main tab, click Progress.
The “Specify Invoice Amounts for Items on Estimate” dialog box shown in 
Figure 10-37 opens.
FIGURE 10-37
You can change only the 
cells in columns with a 
white background. 
The columns with a gray 
background simply show 
the values from the 
estimate and previous 
progress invoices.
3.	 Before you begin changing values, make sure that the correct columns are 
visible by turning on the “Show Quantity and Rate” and/or Show Percent­
age checkbox.
For example, if you’re invoicing based on overall progress, turn on the Show 
Percentage checkbox. That way, you can invoice for the percentage of the 
work that’s done, such as 40%. If you want to invoice for the materials you’ve 
used and the hours people have worked, turn on the “Show Quantity and Rate” 
checkbox. QuickBooks remembers which checkbox(es) you turn on and turns 
the same one(s) on the next time you open this dialog box.
4.	 To change a value on the progress invoice, click the cell you want to change.
Changing a rate is a rare occurrence. However, it might happen if, say, you have 
a contract that bumps your consulting rate by 10 percent for the next calendar 
year. Then, if the job runs into the next calendar year, you can increase the rate 
for the hours worked in January.
When you change a value in the table, QuickBooks recalculates the other col­
umns. For example, if you type a percentage in a “Curr %” (current percentage) 
cell, QuickBooks calculates the amount to invoice by multiplying your estimated 
amount by the current percentage. The “Tot %” column shows the sum of previ­
ously invoiced amounts and the current amount.

Handling Customer Refunds and Credits
If a customer returns a product or finds an overcharge on her last invoice, you have 
two choices: Issue a credit against her balance, or issue a refund by writing her a 
check. If the customer is happy with a credit, then you can apply a credit to her 
account. On the other hand, if the customer doesn’t want to wait to get the money 
she’s due or isn’t planning to purchase anything else from you, a refund check is the 
logical solution. In either case, credits and refunds both begin with a credit memo 
like the one shown in Figure 10-38; this transaction explains the details of the credit 
or refund.
FIGURE 10-38
A credit memo looks a 
lot like an invoice, except 
that the items you add

Creating a Credit Memo from an Invoice
Here’s how to transform an invoice into a credit memo to refund a customer’s money:
1.	 Open the invoice in the Create Invoices window.
The easiest way to find and open the invoice is by clicking Find on the Create 
Invoices window’s Main tab. In the Find box, type the customer’s name or the 
invoice number, and then click Find. When you see the correct invoice in the 
Find box, click it, and then click Go To.

2.	 On the right side of the Create Invoices window’s Main tab, click the Refund/
Credit button.
QuickBooks opens the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (Figure 10-38) 
and copies the information from the invoice into the credit memo.
3.	 If necessary, edit the credit memo.
For example, if you want to refund only a portion of the invoice, you can edit 
values or delete lines from the credit memo. Simply right-click a line in the line-
item table and choose Delete Line on the shortcut menu.
4.	 If you want to print or email the credit memo, turn on the Print Later or 
Email Later checkbox.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save & Close.
The Available Credit dialog box appears with three options for handling the 
credit, as shown in Figure 10-39.
FIGURE 10-39
When you save a credit memo with available credit, QuickBooks 
displays this dialog box. 
To keep the credit around and apply it later (page 292)—to the next 
invoice you create for the customer, for example—choose “Retain as an 
available credit.” If you choose “Give a refund,” QuickBooks opens the 
Issue a Refund window so you can write the refund check. 
Don’t choose “Apply to an invoice” unless that customer has an open 
invoice you can apply the refund to.
Creating Credit Memos
You can also create a credit memo from scratch to, for example, write off bad debt 
for all of a customer’s open invoices. Here’s how:
1.	 In the Home Page’s Customers panel, click Refunds & Credits, or choose 
Customers→Create Credit Memos/Refunds.
The Create Credit Memos/Refunds window opens. If you stay on top of your 
invoice numbers, you’ll notice that QuickBooks automatically uses the next 
invoice number as the credit memo’s number.
2.	 As you would for an invoice, choose a Customer:Job.
Choose a class if you use classes, and, if necessary, choose the credit memo 
template you want to use.

3.	 In the line-item table, add a line for each item you want to credit.
Be sure to include all the charges you want to refund, including shipping and 
taxes.
 TIP 	 If you want to include a message to the customer, choose it in the Customer Message box.
4.	 If you want to print or email the credit memo, turn on the Print Later or 
Email Later checkbox.
5.	 When you’re done, click Save & Close.
When you save a credit memo with an available credit balance, the Available Credit 
dialog box appears with three options for handling the credit, as explained in Figure 
10-39.
Creating Refund Checks
If your customer is dreadfully disgruntled, you’ll probably want to write a refund 
check. If you didn’t do that when the Available Credit dialog box appeared (see the 
previous section), here’s how to do it now:
1.	 Open the Customer Center and, on the Customers & Jobs tab, select the 
customer.
2.	 On the Transactions tab in the window’s lower right, in the Show drop-down 
list, choose Credit Memos.
The list of open credit memos for that customer appears.
3.	 Double-click the credit memo that you want to refund as a check.
The Create Credit Memos/Refunds window opens to that credit memo.
4.	 In the window’s Main tab, click the “Use credit to give refund” button.
QuickBooks opens the Issue a Refund window and fills in all the information 
you need to create the refund.
5.	 In the Issue a Refund window, make sure the settings are correct.
In the window’s “Issue this refund via” box, QuickBooks chooses Check and 
selects the checking account you set in your checking preferences (page 640). 
If the red-faced customer is staring at you from across the counter, choose Cash 
instead, and then click OK.
If the Issue a Refund window’s “To be printed” checkbox is turned on (which it is 
automatically), QuickBooks adds the check to the queue of checks waiting to be 
printed. Click OK to close the Issue a Refund window, and then click Save & Close 
in the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window. Then, to print the refund check 
right away, choose File→Print Forms→Checks. In the Select Checks to Print

dialog box, make sure that the checkmark cell for the refund check is turned on, 
and then click OK. (See page 211 for the full story on printing queued-up checks.)
 NOTE 	 You can also refund money via credit card or other methods, such as E-Check and EFT, depending on 
the payment services you’ve signed up for.
Applying Credits to Existing Invoices
If a customer has an unpaid invoice or statement, you can apply a credit to it and 
reduce the amount that the customer owes. Here’s how:
1.	 Open the invoice in the Create Invoices window.
In the Customer Center (Customers→Customer Center), on the Customers & 
Jobs tab, select the customer. Next, on the Transactions tab in the window’s 
lower right, in the Show drop-down list, choose Invoices. Then, in the Filter By 
box, choose Open Invoices. When you see the correct invoice in the table, click 
it to open it in the Create Invoices window.
2.	 At the top of the Create Invoices window, click Apply Credits.
The Apply Credits dialog box shown in Figure 10-40 opens.
FIGURE 10-40
When you turn on the checkmark cells next 
to credits listed in the Available Credits 
table, the Credits Used value near the top 
of the dialog box shows the total amount 
of credit you’re applying, and the Balance 
Due number shows how much is still due on 
the invoice. 
If the original invoice’s balance is less than 
the available credit, QuickBooks applies only 
enough of the credit to set the invoice’s bal-
ance to zero. You can apply the remaining 
credit to another invoice by repeating the 
steps in this section.

3.	 To apply one of the customer’s credits, in the Available Credits table, turn 
on the checkmark cell for that credit.
If the customer has only one credit, QuickBooks turns on its checkmark cell 
automatically. If you don’t see the credit you expect, it might apply to a different 
job or to the customer only. In that case, click Cancel and start again with step 
1. The box below explains how to transfer a credit for one job to another job.
4.	 In the Apply Credits dialog box, click Done.
QuickBooks takes you back to the Create Invoices window, which shows the 
credit amount in the Payments Applied field and the Balance Due reduced by 
the amount of the credit.
5.	 Click Save & Close.
That’s all there is to it.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Applying a Credit for One Job to a Different Job
If you work on several jobs for the same customer, the customer 
might ask you to apply a credit from one job to another. For 
example, perhaps the job with the credit is already complete 
and the customer wants to use that credit for another job 
that’s still in progress.
QuickBooks doesn’t have a ready-made feature for transfer-
ring credits between jobs. If you want to transfer the credit 
and satisfy your accountant, a couple of journal entries (page 
432) will do the trick, but first you have to create an account 
to hold these credit transfers. In your chart of accounts, cre-
ate an Other Expense account (page 57) and call it something 
like Credit Memo Transfers, Credit Memo Swap Account, or 
Clearing Account.
Because you’re moving money into and out of Accounts 
Receivable and QuickBooks allows only one Accounts Receiv-
able account per journal entry, you need two journal entries 
to complete the credit transfer: one that moves the credit 
from the first job into the clearing account, and a second that 
completes the transfer from the clearing account to the new 
job. Figure 10-41 shows what the two journal entries look like.
Applying Credits to New Invoices
If you create a new invoice for a customer who has a credit due, on the Main tab of 
the Create Invoices window, the Apply Credits button comes to life. Here’s how to 
apply a credit to reduce the invoice’s balance:
1.	 With the new invoice visible in the Create Invoices window (press Ctrl+I to 
open it), on the Main tab, click Apply Credits.
QuickBooks opens the Apply Credits dialog box shown in Figure 10-41.
2.	 Turn on the checkmarks for each credit you want to apply to the invoice, 
and then click Done.
In the Create Invoices window, you’ll see the credit amount in the Payments 
Applied field and the Balance Due reduced by the amount of the credit.

Bottom: The second journal entry transfers

Modifying Invoices
You can make changes to invoices as you work on them or after you’ve saved them 
to, for example, add or remove items a customer requests. And if a customer de­
cides to cancel an entire order, you can void an invoice, which zeroes out its total. 
You can even delete an invoice, although this maneuver makes sense only if you 
created the invoice by mistake. This section describes how to perform all these 
invoice-related tasks.
Editing Invoices
While you’re in the process of creating an invoice or a sales receipt, you can jump 
to any field and change its value, delete lines, or insert new ones. 
Even after you’ve saved an invoice, editing it is easy: Anytime an invoice is visible in 
the Create Invoices window, you can click any field and make whatever change you 
want. If you’ve already printed the invoice, turn on the Print Later checkbox so you 
don’t forget to reprint the form with the changes you made.
 TIP 	 If you’ve already received a payment against an invoice, don’t edit that invoice; doing so can disrupt 
the connections between payment, invoice, and accounts to the point that you’ll never straighten it out. If you 
undercharged the customer, simply create a new invoice with the missing charges on it. If you charged the 
customer for something she didn’t buy, issue a credit memo or refund (see page 288).

MODIFYING 
INVOICES
Voiding and Deleting Invoices
Sometimes, you want to eliminate an invoice—for instance, when you create one by 
mistake and want to remove its values from your accounts. QuickBooks provides 
two options, but for your sanity’s sake, you should always void invoices that you 
don’t want rather than deleting them.
When you void an invoice, QuickBooks resets its dollar values to zero so that your 
account balances show no sign of the transaction. It also marks the transaction 
as void so you know what happened to it when you stumble upon it in the future.
If you delete an invoice instead, QuickBooks truly deletes the transaction, removing 
its dollar values from your accounts and deleting all signs of it. All that remains is 
a hole in your invoice-numbering sequence and an entry in the audit trail that says 
you deleted the transaction (page 437). If your accountant or the IRS looks at your 
books a few years down the road, your chances of remembering what happened 
to the invoice are slim. And if an invoice has a payment attached to it, deleting it is 
even more problematic: You have to delete the bank deposit first, followed by the 
customer’s payment, and then finally the invoice. Bottom line: Don’t delete invoices; 
void them instead.
To void an invoice:
1.	 Open the Create Invoices window, and then, on the Main tab, click Find.
2.	 In the Find Invoices dialog box, fill in the invoice number, customer name, or 
date, and then click Find. In the Find dialog box that appears, double-click 
the invoice you want to void.
The invoice appears in the Create Invoices window.
3.	 Right-click in the Create Invoices window, and then choose Void Invoice 
from the shortcut menu. Alternatively, on the Create Invoices window’s 
Main tab, choose Delete→Void.
All the values in the form change to zero, and QuickBooks adds “VOID” to 
the Memo field. To remind yourself why you voided this transaction, type the 
reason after “VOID.”
4.	 Click Save & Close.
 NOTE 	 If you open the Accounts Receivable register’s window, you might get nervous when you see the 
word “Paid” in the Amt Paid column of a voided transaction. Don’t worry: Notice that the amount paid is zero, 
and that the word “Void” is in the Description field. The word “Paid” in the Amt Paid column is just QuickBooks’ 
way of telling you the invoice is no longer open.

CHAPTER
11
S
tatements are the perfect solution for businesses that charge individuals for 
time and other services in bits and pieces, such as law offices, cellphone ser­
vice providers, and astrology advisors. Statements can summarize the charges 
racked up during the statement period (usually a month). They’re also great for show­
ing payments and outstanding balances, the way your cable bill shows the charges 
for your monthly service, the pay-per-view movies you ordered, your last payment, 
and your current balance. So even if you invoice your customers, you can send 
statements to show them their previous balances, payments received, new charges, 
and overdue invoices. (To learn about what statements don’t do, see page 222.)
However, business-to-business invoicing is another story. Most accounting depart­
ments process only vendor invoices and credit memos for payments, so statements 
end up in the wastebasket. So if you do business only with other businesses, you’re 
better off turning off QuickBooks’ statements feature (the Note on page 296 explains 
where to find the preference to do that).
In this chapter, you’ll find out how to produce statements, whether you accumulate 
charges over time or simply summarize your customers’ account statuses.
Generating Statements
Think of a statement as a report of all the charges and payments during the statement 
period that you can send to your customer. The dates you choose for the statement 
determine its previous balance and the charges and customer payments it includes. 
Businesses typically send statements out once a month, but you can generate them 
for any time period you want.

GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
 NOTE 	 To work with statements and statement charges, make sure the statements preference is turned on. 
Choose Edit→Preferences→Desktop View, and then click the Company Preferences tab. Make sure the “State­
ments and Statement Charges” checkbox is turned on, and then click OK.
In QuickBooks, creating statements is a simple process:
1.	 If you want to charge your customers directly on statements, in the Ac­
counts Receivable account register, enter statement charges (explained in 
a moment) for the services or other items you delivered to your customers.
If you use statements simply to show invoices, payments, and the resulting 
balance, you can skip this step.
2.	 Generate statements for your customers.
The following pages explain how to complete both these steps.
Creating Statement Charges
Statement charges are charges for services and items you deliver to your customers 
that you add directly to the Accounts Receivable account. They look like the line 
items you see on invoices, except for a few small but important omissions. When 
you select an item for a statement charge, you won’t see any Sales Tax, percentage 
discount, Subtotal, or Group items in the Item drop-down list because QuickBooks 
doesn’t let you use those features in statements. When you generate statements 
(explained in the next section), QuickBooks automatically grabs any payments that 
have been made, so you don’t see Payment items in the Item drop-down list, either.
Here are the types of items that you can use to create statement charges:
• Service items
• Inventory Part items
• Inventory Assembly items (if you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise)
• Non-inventory Part items
• Other Charge items
 TIP 	 Statement charges don’t handle sales tax. For that reason, you should use an invoice to bill for taxable 
items so QuickBooks can calculate the sales tax for you. Then, if you generate statements, QuickBooks scoops up 
that invoice and pops it into the appropriate statement.
Unlike invoice line items, you create statement charges directly in the Accounts 
Receivable register for the customer or job that racked up the charges, as shown in 
Figure 11-1. A statement charge has fields much like those for a line item in an invoice, 
although they’re scrunched into two lines in the Accounts Receivable register. If you 
track your time and billable expenses in QuickBooks, you can use the Time/Costs 
feature to add billable time and expenses to the customer’s Accounts Receivable

register without going through the steps to create statement charges. This section 
explains how to add statement charges directly to the Accounts Receivable register 
and how to use the Time/Costs feature.
FIGURE 11-1
Because invoices, pay-
ments, and credits post to 
your Accounts Receivable 
account, statements 
automatically pull those 
transactions from your 
Accounts Receivable ac-
count’s register. 
To create statement 
charges for billable time, 
costs, or mileage, in the 
Accounts Receivable 
window’s toolbar, click 
Time/Costs.
You enter statement charges in a customer’s Accounts Receivable register (which 
is where QuickBooks stores the customer’s invoices, credits, and payments), so 
the total in the register represents the customer’s balance. Here’s how to create a 
statement charge:
1.	 Choose Customers→Enter Statement Charges or, in the Home Page’s Cus­
tomers panel, click the Statement Charges icon.
The Accounts Receivable register window opens.
2.	 In the Customer:Job drop-down list, choose the customer or job to whom 
you want to assign the statement charge.
The Accounts Receivable register window then shows only Accounts Receivable 
for the customer or job you chose.
 NOTE 	 If you set up the customer or job to use a foreign currency, you can’t record statement charges for that 
customer or job directly in the Accounts Receivable register. Instead, choose Company→Make General Journal 
Entry, and then record the charge as a journal entry. (You can also open the Make General Journal Entries window 
by clicking Edit Transaction in the Accounts Receivable window’s toolbar.)
3.	 If you track billable time, costs, or mileage, create statement charges for 
those items by clicking Time/Costs in the Accounts Receivable window’s 
toolbar.
The “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box that opens is the same one 
you see when you add billable time and costs to an invoice (page 255). Select 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
298
GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
the time and expenses you want to add, and then click OK. QuickBooks adds 
the selected items to the Accounts Receivable register and sets their Type to 
STMTCHG to indicate that the charges will appear on a statement instead of 
an invoice.
4.	 To add a statement charge to the Accounts Receivable register, in a blank 
line of the register, choose the item you want to charge for from the Item 
drop-down list.
Figure 11-2 shows the fields for a blank transaction. When you choose an item, 
QuickBooks fills in the Rate and Description fields with the rate and description 
from the item’s record (page 109) and sets the Type to STMTCHG to denote a 
charge that appears on a statement rather than an invoice. The program also 
copies the value in the Rate field to the Amt Chrg field (the total amount for 
the charge).
FIGURE 11-2
Labels for statement 
charge fields appear 
above the register in 
the Accounts Receivable 
register window. 
Each cell in a transaction 
row displays its field label 
in gray text until you click 
that cell to select it.
5.	 Press Tab to move to the Qty field, and then type a quantity for the item. (If 
you don’t use a quantity and rate, then type the amount you want to charge 
in the Amt Chrg field instead.)
If you enter a quantity (based on the units for the item as described in the Note 
on page 109), then when you move to another field (by pressing Tab or click­
ing the field), QuickBooks updates the total amount in the Amt Chrg field by 
multiplying the rate by the quantity.
6.	 If you want to change the rate, press Tab to move to the Rate field, and then 
type the correct value.
When you edit the value in the Rate field, QuickBooks recalculates the amount 
in the Amt Chrg field.

Chapter 11: Producing Statements
299
GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
7.	 If you want to revise the charge’s description (which will appear on the 
statement you create), edit the Description field.
QuickBooks automatically fills in this field with the first paragraph of the Descrip­
tion field (labeled “Description on Sales Transaction” if the service is performed 
by a subcontractor or partner) from the item’s record, but you can see only a 
smidgeon of it. To see the whole thing, put your cursor over the Description field, 
and QuickBooks displays the field’s full contents in a tooltip just below the field.
8.	 If you use classes (page 140), in the Class field, choose the one you want.
You can skip the Class field if it doesn’t apply to this statement charge. If you 
set the preference to make QuickBooks prompt you about classes (page 636), 
then when you try to save the statement charge, QuickBooks asks if you want 
to save it without a class. Click Save Anyway to omit the class, or click Cancel 
to return to the transaction and add one.
9.	 To control which statement the charge appears on, in the Billed Date field, 
choose a date for the charge.
QuickBooks uses the value in this field to determine which statement includes 
the charge. When you add a statement charge that you want to save for a future 
statement, be sure to choose a billed date within the correct time period. For 
example, if a membership fee comes due in April, choose a billed date that falls 
in April. That way, the statement charge won’t show up until you generate the 
customer’s April statement. On the other hand, if you forgot a charge from the 
previous month, set its billed date to a day in the current month so the charge 
appears on this month’s statement.
10.	 If you plan to assess finance charges for late payments, then in the Due Date 
field, choose the day when payment is due.
QuickBooks uses this date along with your preferences for finance charges 
(page 646) to calculate any late charges the customer owes you. (The due date 
is based on the terms you apply to the customer [page 76].) But late-charge 
calculations don’t happen until you generate statements.
11.	 To save the statement charge, click the Record button.
 TIP 	 If you charge the same amount every month, memorize the first statement charge: With the statement 
charge filled in and selected in the register, either press Ctrl+M or right-click the statement charge and choose 
Memorize Stmt Charge on the shortcut menu. In the Memorize Transaction dialog box, set its recurrence schedule 
to the same day each month and choose the option to record the transaction automatically (page 324), and then 
click OK. QuickBooks then takes care of entering your statement charges for you, so all you have to do is generate 
customer statements once a month.
Generating Customer Statements
QuickBooks is smart, but it can’t read your mind. The statements it generates in­
clude only the statement charges and other transactions you’ve entered. So before 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
300
GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
you produce monthly statements, double-check that you’ve entered all payments, 
credits, and refunds that your customers are due, and all new statement charges 
for the period.
To begin creating statements, choose Customers→Create Statements or, in the Home 
Page’s Customers panel, click the Statements icon. As Figure 11-3 shows, everything 
about the statements you generate appears in the Create Statements window, includ­
ing the date range for the statements, the customers you want to send statements 
to, the template you’re using, printing options, and finance charges. The sections 
that follow explain your options and the best ways to apply them.
FIGURE 11-3
The options in the Select 
Customers section let you 
create statements for a 
subset of your customers, 
which comes in handy if 
you send statements to 
some customers by email 
and to some by U.S. mail, 
for example. In that case, 
you’d create two sets: one 
for email and the other 
for paper. You can also 
create a statement for 
a single customer if you 
made a mistake and want 
a corrected version. Or you 
can generate statements 
only for customers with 
balances.
 NOTE 	 If you’ve turned on the multiple currency preference (page 656), the Create Statement window displays 
the A/R Account box at its top left (it’s visible in Figure 11-3). Use it to choose the correct Accounts Receivable 
account for the currency that applies to the statements you want to create. Repeat the statement-generation 
steps for each currency you use.
CHOOSING THE DATE RANGE
Statements typically cover a set time period, like a month. But the statement’s date 
doesn’t have to be during that period. For example, you might wait until the day 
after the period ends to generate the statement so you’re sure to capture every 
transaction. In the Create Statements window’s Select Statement Options section, 
you can adjust the following settings:

Chapter 11: Producing Statements
301
GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
• Statement Date. In this field, type the date that you want to appear on the 
statement. In Figure 11-3, for example, the statement date is the day after the 
last day of the statement period.
• Statement Period From _ To _. Select this option to create statements for a 
period of time. For example, if you produce monthly statements, in the From 
box, choose the first day of the month, and in the To box, choose the last day 
of the month. Or you can choose dates to generate statements for a quarter 
or other date range.
• All open transactions as of Statement Date. Choosing this option adds every 
unpaid statement charge to the statement, regardless of when the charge hap­
pened. This option is particularly helpful when you want to generate a list of all 
overdue charges so you can send a reminder to woefully tardy customers. To 
filter the list of open transactions to only those overdue by a certain number of 
days, turn on the “Include only transactions over _ days past due date” check­
box, and then type the number of days late.
SELECTING CUSTOMERS
In the Create Statements window’s Select Customers section, QuickBooks initially 
selects the All Customers option because most companies send statements to every 
customer. But you can choose another option to limit the list of recipients. (The next 
time you open the Create Statements window, QuickBooks remembers the option 
you chose and selects it automatically.) Here are your other options and the reasons 
you might choose each one:
• Multiple Customers. To specify the exact set of customers to whom you want to 
send statements (customers who received statements with errors on them, say), 
choose this option. After you do that, click the Choose button that appears to its 
right. In the Print Statements dialog box that opens, QuickBooks automatically 
selects the Manual option, so you can select each customer or job that you want 
to send a statement to (click individual customers or jobs in the dialog box’s 
list or drag over adjacent customers to select them and display checkmarks 
next to their names). The Automatic option isn’t really automatic—you have to 
type a customer’s name exactly as it appears in the Customer Name field in the 
customer’s record to select that single customer. So it’s much easier to select 
the Manual option and then scroll to the name you want.
• One Customer. To create a corrected statement for a single customer, choose 
this option. In the field that appears, click the down arrow, and then choose 
the customer or job.
• Customers of Type. If you categorize customers by type and process their 
statements differently, choose this option. For example, you might spread your 
billing work out by sending statements to your corporate customers at the end 
of the month and to individuals on the 15th. In the drop-down list that appears, 
choose a customer type.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
302
GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
• Preferred Send Method. If you print some statements and email others, you’ll 
have to create statements in two batches. Choose this option and, in the drop-
down list that appears, pick one of the send methods. For example, choose 
E-mail here, and then click the E-mail button at the bottom of the window to 
send statements to the customers who prefer to receive bills that way. (Page 
318 explains how to email forms.)
 TIP 	 If you loathe stuffing envelopes and licking stamps, offer your customers a discount for receiving their 
statements (or invoices and credit memos) via email. They’re likely to say yes, and you can then send them 
statements from QuickBooks in the blink of an eye.
• View Selected Customers. Before you generate statements by clicking Print 
or E-mail, click this button to make sure you’ve chosen the correct customers.
SETTING ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
In the Create Statements window’s Template box, QuickBooks automatically selects 
Intuit Standard Statement, but you can choose your own customized template in­
stead (page 707). You can also control what QuickBooks adds to statements and 
which statements it should skip:
• Create One Statement. In this drop-down list, choosing Per Customer can save 
some trees because it makes QuickBooks generate one statement for each cus­
tomer, no matter how many jobs you do for them. (On the statements, charges 
are grouped by job.) If each job has its own mailing address, you can create 
separate statements for each job instead by choosing Per Job here.
• Show invoice item details on statements. If you send statements only to find 
yourself answering customers’ questions about what line items represent, turn on 
this checkbox to include invoice details on statements. That way, your customers 
can see all the info about the invoices on the statement, which could lead to faster 
payments. Say you run a landscaping company and mow lawns once a week. 
By turning on this checkbox, you don’t have to send weekly invoices; instead, 
you can send a monthly statement that includes the individual invoice details.
• Print statements by billing address zip code. Turn on this checkbox if you 
have a bulk-mail permit, which requires that you mail by Zip code.
• Print due date on transactions. QuickBooks automatically turns on this check­
box because you’ll typically want to show the due date for each entry on your 
statements.
• Do not create statements. Printing unnecessary statements is a waste of time 
and paper. QuickBooks includes several settings that you can choose to skip 
certain statements. For example, you can turn on the “with a zero balance” 
checkbox to skip statements for customers who don’t owe you anything. (Leave 
this checkbox off if you want to send a statement to show that the customer’s 
last payment arrived and that its balance due is zero.)

Chapter 11: Producing Statements
303
GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
You might also decide to skip customers unless their balance exceeds your 
typical cost of processing a statement. With the cost of a first-class stamp and 
letterhead, envelope, and a label, you might skip statements unless the balance 
is at least $5 or so. Turn on the “with a balance less than” checkbox and, in the 
box to its right, type a dollar value.
You can also skip customers with no activity during the statement period—no 
charges, no payments, no transactions whatsoever—by turning on the “with no 
account activity” checkbox.
QuickBooks automatically turns on the “for inactive customers” checkbox be­
cause there’s no reason to send statements to customers who aren’t actively 
doing business with you.
• Assess Finance Charges. Not surprisingly, you have to turn on QuickBooks’ 
finance charge feature before you can assess finance charges (see page 646). 
Once you’ve done that, you can click this button to add finance charges to your 
statements. In the Assess Finance Charges dialog box, you have the opportunity 
to turn off the checkmarks for individual customers. For example, if a squir­
rel ate your customer’s last statement, you can turn off the checkmark in that 
customer’s entry to tell QuickBooks not to penalize her with a finance charge. 
(You can also assess finance charges before you start the statement process 
by clicking the Finance Charges icon on the Home Page.)
Previewing Statements
Before you print statements on expensive letterhead or email them to your custom­
ers, it’s a good idea to preview them to make sure you’ve chosen the right customers 
and that the statements are correct. Here’s how to preview statements before you 
print or email them:
1.	 In the Create Statements window, click Preview.
QuickBooks opens the Print Preview window (Figure 11-4), which works like its 
counterparts in other programs.
2.	 Click “Prev page” or “Next page” to view the other statements in this batch.
If you left your reading glasses at home, click Zoom In to get a closer look. 
(The button’s label changes to “Zoom Out” so you can click it to return to a 
bird’s-eye view.)
3.	 To return to the Create Statements window and print or email your state­
ments, click Close.
The Print Preview window includes a Print button, but it’s not the best way to 
print statements. Clicking it begins printing your statements immediately, so 
you don’t have a chance to set your print options, like which printer to use or 
the number of copies. To adjust those settings as described on page 308, click 
Close, and then click Print in the Create Statements window instead.

GENERATING 
STATEMENTS
FIGURE 11-4
If you generate statements 
for a given time period, 
the first line in the body 
of a statement is “Balance 
forward,” which is the 
amount due prior to this 
statement’s opening date. 
The value in the Amount 
Due field is the total 
amount the customer owes 
you, which is the sum of 
the “Balance forward” 
value plus all the transac-
tions for that customer or 
job that happened during 
the statement’s date 
range, including payments. 
At the bottom of the state-
ment, the Amount Due 
figure is carved up into 
how much is current and 
how much is past due.
Generating Statements
When you’re sure the statements are correct, in the Create Statements window, click 
Print or E-mail to generate your statements. This section describes how to do both.
EMAILING STATEMENTS
To email statements directly from QuickBooks, in the Create Statements window, 
click E-mail. If you use Microsoft Outlook, QuickBooks creates email messages in 
Outlook and automatically fills in the customers’ email addresses. The messages 
contain the standard message you’ve set up for statements (page 665).
If you set up QuickBooks to use a web-based email service instead (page 665), the 
Send Forms dialog box opens, showing the statements you’re about to email. There 
you can select additional statements, turn off statements you don’t want to send, 
and click a statement to preview its content. Click Send Now to dispatch them to 
your customers.

Here’s how to print statements:
1.	 In the Create Statements window, click Print.
QuickBooks opens the Print Statement(s) dialog box.
2.	 Choose the printer you want to use.
For example, if you have a printer loaded with preprinted forms, select it in 
the “Printer name” drop-down list. (See page 309 to learn how to designate a 
printer so QuickBooks uses it every time you print statements.)
3.	 Select one of the “Print on” options.
If you select “Intuit Preprinted forms,” QuickBooks doesn’t print the name of the 
form or the lines around fields, because they’re already on the preprinted page. 
The “Blank paper” option tells the program to print the statements exactly the 
way you see them in the Print Preview window. The Letterhead option shrinks 
the form to leave a 2-inch band at the top of the page for your company logo.
 TIP 	 If your letterhead is laid out in an unusual way (your logo runs down the left side of the page, for 
instance), create a custom statement template (page 707) that leaves room for your letterhead elements, and 
then choose the “Blank paper” option.
4.	 In the “Number of copies” box, type the number of copies of each state­
ment you want to print.
For example, if you want one copy for the customer and one for your files, type 2.
5.	 Click Print.

CHAPTER

Q
uickBooks can zip you through the two basic ways of producing and distribut­
ing invoices and other forms: on paper and electronically. Within those two 
camps, you can choose to produce and send forms as soon as you complete 
them or place them in a queue to process in batches. For sporadic forms, it’s easier 
to print or email them as you go. But when you generate dozens or even hundreds 
of sales orders, invoices, statements, or checks, printing and emailing batches is a 
much better use of your time.
If you have workhorse transactions that you enter again and again, QuickBooks can 
memorize them and then fill in most, if not all, of the fields in future transactions 
for you. For transactions that happen on a regular schedule—like monthly customer 
invoices or vendor bills—the program can remind you when it’s time to record them, 
or even add the transactions without any help from you. You can also memorize 
transactions that you use occasionally, such as estimates, and call on them only 
when you need them.
Once you’ve created lots of transactions, you’ll need a way to locate them. Quick­
Books’ search features can help you track down financial info, which you can appreci­
ate if you’ve ever hunted frantically for a transaction. Whether you want to correct 
a billing problem on a customer’s invoice, check whether you paid a vendor’s bill, or 
look for the item you want to add to an estimate, QuickBooks gives you several ways 
to search. You can look for different types of transactions within various date ranges 
in the Customer, Vendor, and Employee centers—and the Inventory Center, if you use 
QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise. The Item List window sports a few search boxes 
for finding the items you want. Form windows, such as Create Invoices, have a Find 
button on their Main tabs so you can quickly find transactions of the corresponding

type. You can use the program’s Search feature to search throughout your company 
file or QuickBooks. And the full-blown Find feature is perfect for surgical searches. 
This chapter explains all your options.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks’ Attachments feature lets you attach files to records, such as customers and vendors, and 
to transactions, such as invoices. See the box on page 314 for more info.
Printing Forms
Before you can start printing, you have some setup to do. But once QuickBooks’ 
print settings are in place and there’s paper in your printer, you can print forms with 
just a click or two.
If you want to apply special settings to certain types of forms, then for each one, 
QuickBooks needs to know the printer you want to use, the paper you print to (like 
preprinted forms or letterhead), and a few other details. (The program remembers 
these settings, so you have to go through this process only once for each type of 
form.) From then on, QuickBooks fills in the Print dialog box’s settings automati­
cally when you choose a type of form to print, although you can change the settings 
before you print.
With these prep tasks behind you, you’re ready to print. You can either print a form 
right away or add it to a queue to print in batches. This section explains how to ac­
complish all these printing tasks.
 TIP 	 To make sure you don’t forget to process forms, you can create reminders (page 483) for invoices, credit 
memos, sales receipts, and—if you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise—sales orders that are queued up to 
print.
Setting Print Options
For the forms you print using basic settings—such as printing to your workhorse 
printer on blank paper using portrait orientation—you don’t have to bother specifying 
print options. But if you print invoices on multipart forms, paychecks on preprinted 
check forms, statements on letterhead, and reports on plain paper, you can assign 
a different printer and settings to the forms with special printing needs. Keep each 
printer stocked with the right type of paper, and you can print your documents 
with barely a glance at the print options. If you set up print settings in QuickBooks 
before you print, the program will fill in those settings for you automatically when 
you choose a type of form. (However, print dialog boxes still appear, so you can 
change any print options before committing your documents to paper.)

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers
309
PRINTING 
FORMS
 TIP 	 Many of the options in the “Printer setup” dialog box are the same as options you can set within your 
operating system, as Figure 12-1 shows. However, QuickBooks keeps the options you choose in its “Printer setup” 
dialog box separate from your operating system settings. So, for example, if you use Windows’ printer options to 
set your most popular printer to use portrait orientation, you can set that same printer to use landscape orientation 
in QuickBooks.
FIGURE 12-1
The printers that you’ve 
set up in your operating 
system are the ones that 
appear in the “Printer 
name” list here. 
QuickBooks starts out by 
displaying the printing 
preferences you set up in 
your operating system, 
but you can adjust them 
by choosing a printer and 
then clicking Options.
To assign and set up printers for forms in QuickBooks, choose File→Printer Setup. 
Then adjust the following settings:
• Form Name. As you learned earlier, in QuickBooks, each form has its own print 
settings, so you’re free to print invoices on letterhead, timesheets in landscape 
orientation, and checks to a printer filled with preprinted checks. Use this drop-
down list to choose the form you want to set up for printing.
• Printer name. Choose a printer here to designate it as the standard for the 
form you selected above. Whenever you print that type of form, QuickBooks 
will automatically select this printer, but you can always choose a different 
printer—for instance, when you switch between printing paper documents and 
creating Adobe PDF files that you can email.
• Options. If you want to adjust the properties for the printer you chose, click 
this button. In the dialog box that appears, depending on the type of printer, 
you can change things like the document’s orientation, page order, pages per 
sheet, print quality, paper tray, color, and so on.
 NOTE 	 The rest of the settings in this list appear for most of the forms in the Form Name drop-down list, but 
not all of them. For example, you don’t see the “Printer type” setting for reports (to learn about print settings 
for reports, see page 586).

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

PRINTING 
FORMS
• Printer type. When you choose a printer name, QuickBooks fills in this box with 
its best guess of the type (it usually guesses right). If it guesses wrong, simply 
choose the correct type in this drop-down list. If the printer feeds individual 
pages through, such as letterhead or blank paper, choose “Page-oriented (Single 
sheets).” If it feeds continuous sheets of paper with perforations on the edges, 
such as the green-striped paper so popular in the past, choose “Continuous 
(Perforated Edge).”
• Print on. QuickBooks gives you three options here:
—
— Intuit Preprinted forms. If you purchase preprinted forms, which typically 
include your company’s information, field labels, and lines that separate 
fields, choose this option. When you print your documents, QuickBooks 
includes only the forms’ data.
 TIP 	 If you use preprinted forms, a small misalignment can make your documents look sloppy and unprofes­
sional. You’ll learn how to align documents to the paper in your printer in the next section.
—
— Blank paper. This option tells QuickBooks to print everything in your docu­
ment: company info, logo, labels, and data. This is the easiest way to print 
because you don’t have to worry about aligning the paper and the form. If 
you set up a template with your company logo and attractive fonts (page 
711), you can produce a professional-looking form on blank paper.
—
— Letterhead. When you print to letterhead that already includes your com­
pany’s address and other information, you don’t need to print that info on 
your documents. Choose this option to tell QuickBooks to skip printing 
your company information.
 TIP 	 The Letterhead option tells QuickBooks to start printing the form 2 inches from the top of the paper. If 
your letterhead has your logo and company information somewhere other than the top of the page, don’t use 
this option. Instead, create a custom template for your form (page 707) to leave room for the logo. Then, when 
you print, select the “Blank paper” option.
• Do not print lines around each field. Turning on this checkbox is a matter of 
personal preference. Lines around each field make it clear which information 
belongs to which label, but you might consider those lines unnecessary. If your 
template separates fields to your satisfaction, turn off this checkbox to print 
only the labels and data, not borders around each field. (Because preprinted 
forms include borders, QuickBooks automatically turns on this checkbox if you 
choose the “Intuit Preprinted forms” option.)
Aligning Forms and Paper
If you’ve ever gotten lost in an office-supply store, you understand why printing 
includes so many options. You can print on different types of paper using different 
types of printers, and making the two line up properly can be a delicate process. 

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers
311
PRINTING 
FORMS
And besides invoices and other forms, you might also print ancillary documents like 
mailing labels and packing slips.
To save some trees and your sanity, make sure the paper in your printer is aligned 
properly before you print, especially if you use fancy letterhead or preprinted forms. 
(When you use preprinted forms or continuous-feed paper with perforations for 
page breaks, the alignment of the paper is crucial: If it’s not lined up properly, your 
data won’t appear next to the correct labels or an invoice might print over a page 
break.) It’s a good idea to print a sample to check the alignment of your forms and 
paper every time you print, but it’s particularly important if you’re printing a big 
batch of forms. If the sample’s alignment is off, here’s how to save time, paper, and 
your mental health:
1.	 Choose File→Printer Setup.
The “Printer setup” dialog box opens.
 NOTE 	 You can also align forms just before you print a batch: Choose File→Print Forms, and then choose the 
type of form you want to align, such as Invoices. In the “Select [forms] to Print” dialog box, select the ones you 
want to print, and then click OK to open the “Print [forms]” dialog box, such as Print Invoices if you’re printing 
invoices. In that dialog box, click Align.
2.	 From the Form Name drop-down list, choose the type of form you want to 
align, and then click Align.
If you have more than one template to choose from, QuickBooks opens the 
Align Printer dialog box. Choose the template you want to use to align your 
paper, and then click OK. 
If you have only one template, the program goes straight to a different dialog 
box; exactly which one depends on the type of paper that’s selected in the 
“Printer setup” dialog box’s “Printer type” list:
—
— If the Continuous (Perforated Edge) option is selected, you’ll perform both 
steps 3 and 4.
—
— If the Page-oriented (Single sheets) option is selected, the Fine Alignment 
dialog box appears and you can skip to step 4.
3.	 If the Printer type is Continuous (Perforated Edge), the “Use ‘Coarse’ for 
Big Vertical Adjustments” dialog box opens. Position the paper so the print 
head is just below a page break, click Coarse, and then click OK to print a 
sample form.
After you print a sample form, don’t adjust the paper in your printer (QuickBooks 
warns you several times not to). The form that prints includes text indicating a 
pointer line. When the Coarse Alignment dialog box appears on your screen, 
in the Pointer Line Position box, type the number of the line preprinted in the 
paper’s margin where the pointer line text printed. QuickBooks uses that num­
ber to align the form and the paper. Click OK to print another sample. When 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

FORMS
the alignment is correct, click Close. You can then perform a fine alignment, if 
necessary, by clicking Fine Align.
4.	 In the Fine Alignment dialog box’s Vertical and Horizontal boxes (Figure 
12-2), type numbers to represent the hundredths of an inch to move the 
form to line it up with the paper.
After you tweak the alignment, click Print Sample to check the printed form’s 
appearance. When the form is aligned, click OK—and keep your mitts off the 
paper in the printer.
FIGURE 12-2
Typing a positive number in the Vertical box moves the form toward 
the top of the page. A positive number in the Horizontal box moves 
the form to the right on the page. 
Negative vertical and horizontal numbers move the form down and to 
the left, respectively.
Choosing a Print Method
At the top of each QuickBooks form’s window are the same basic printing options; 
Figure 12-3 shows the Create Invoices window as an example. Here’s a guide to your 
choices for printing documents:
• Preview a form before printing. On the form window’s Main tab, click Print, 
and then choose Preview from the drop-down menu.
• Print one form. If you want to print the current form, on the form window’s 
Main tab, click Print, and then choose the type of form from the drop-down 
menu (in Figure 12-3, that’s Invoice).
• Printing in batches. If you turn on the Print Later checkbox at the top of the 
form window, QuickBooks adds the current form to a queue that you can print 
as a batch. To print the batch of forms, at the top of the form window, click 
Print, and then choose Batch from the drop-down menu.
• Print special forms. If you want to print a packing slip, shipping label, or en­
velope to go with the form you’re printing, at the top of the form window, click 
Print, and then choose Packing Slip, Shipping Label, or Envelope from the drop-
down menu. If you choose Envelope, you have to specify the size and whether 
you want to include the return address (you don’t if your envelopes already 
have your return address on them). You can even print a delivery barcode for 
addresses in the United States.

FIGURE 12-3
From a form’s window, you can 
print one document at a time 
or queue them up to print in 
batches. 
To process batches of documents, 
you can choose File→Print 
Forms from the main QuickBooks 
menu bar and then choose the 
type of form you want to print.
Printing One Form
When you display a form in its corresponding window, you can print it right away. To 
preview the form before you print it, on the window’s Main tab, click Print→Preview. 
The Print Preview window opens and shows you what the form will look like when 
you print it. Click Close to close the Print Preview window and return to the form’s 
window.
To print the current form, click Print, and then choose the form type (Invoice, in this 
example). QuickBooks displays the Print One Invoice dialog box, where you can 
choose the printer and paper. (You can also preview the form by clicking Preview 
in this dialog box.)
 NOTE 	 To prevent embezzling, QuickBooks automatically saves forms when you print them. That way, if you 
change a form after you print it, the audit trail shows a record of the change.
Printing in Batches
If the Print Later checkbox is turned on when you save a form, QuickBooks adds 
that form to a print queue. After you’ve checked that your printer contains the cor­
rect paper and that the paper is aligned properly, you can print all the forms in the 
queue in just a few steps:

GEM IN THE ROUGH
Keeping Related Info Near at Hand
QuickBooks offers a helpful file-attachment feature that lets 
you attach files to records and transactions in your company 
file. For example, you can attach an electronic copy of a job 
contract to a customer record, a photo of an item you sell to 
the item’s record, or a scanned receipt to a credit card charge.
QuickBooks gives you several different ways to use this feature, 
depending on where you are in the program:
• In the Doc Center (Company→Documents→Doc Center), 
you can attach documents that you scan in with a scanner 
or drag over from Outlook or folders on your computer.
• In the Customer Center, Vendor Center, Employee Center, 
or Inventory Center, select the name or item you want 
to attach a file to, and then click the Attach button at 
the window’s upper right (the button has a paper-clip 
icon on it).
• In a transaction window like Create Invoices, display the 
transaction you want to attach something to, and then 
click the Attach File button on the window’s Main tab.
When you click either the Attach or Attach File button, the 
Attachments window appears. At the top of the window, click 
the Computer, Scanner, or Doc Center button to tell QuickBooks 
where the file you want to attach is coming from. Or simply drag 
the file onto the area labeled “Drop document from Outlook, 
your desktop, or folders here.”
Attaching documents to records and transactions keeps refer-
ence info within easy reach. Whenever you open a record or 
transaction in QuickBooks that has files attached to it, you 
can see those files by clicking the Attach or Attach File button. 
However, if you want to attach files that change from time to 
time, such as requirements or job drawings, there are some 
caveats to be aware of.
When you create an attachment in QuickBooks, you aren’t 
attaching the original document. (Some programs, like Word 
and Excel, let you insert hyperlinks to files so that clicking a 
link opens the original file regardless of where it’s located, 
but QuickBooks doesn’t work that way.) Instead, QuickBooks 
creates a copy of the file and attaches the copy. So if you edit 
the original document, you won’t see those changes in the 
attached document. QuickBooks puts the copies it creates in a 
set of subfolders within the folder that holds your company file. 
For example, say your company file is stored in My Documents\
Data_Files. If you attach a document to an invoice, QuickBooks 
stores a copy of the file in the folder My Documents\Data_Files\
Attach\[company file name]\Txn\[ID], where “ID” identifies 
the transaction. If you attach a document to a customer’s 
record, the copy ends up in My Documents\Data_Files\Attach\
[company file name]\List\Name\[ID], where “ID” is a code that 
represents the customer.
QuickBooks is particular about where a company file’s Attach 
folder is located. If you move it, your attached files for that 
company file won’t show up in the Doc Center. If files go 
missing in the Doc Center, make sure the Attach folder is in 
the same folder that holds the corresponding company file. 
Then, in QuickBooks, choose Company→Documents→Repair 
Attached Document Links.
Fortunately, you don’t have to navigate to the Attach folders 
to find your file attachments. You can simply manage your 
attached files in the Doc Center.
1.	 Choose File→Print Forms, and then choose the type of form you want to 
print. (Or, on the Main tab of the form’s window—like Create Invoices, for 
example—click Print→Batch.)
Either way, QuickBooks opens the “Select [forms] to Print” dialog box with all 
your unprinted forms selected, as shown in Figure 12-4. You can turn check­
marks on or off one at a time or by dragging down the checkmark column. You 
can also select or deselect all the forms by clicking Select All or Select None.

To remove any form from the

turn it off. After you pay a bill, 
you can print a bill payment 
receipt: Choose File→Print 
Forms→Bill Payment Stubs to 
see the bill payment receipts 
that are ready to print.
2.	 If you want to print labels for the selected forms, click Print Labels.
The next section dishes out the details on printing labels. After you print the 
labels, you’re back in the “Select [forms] to Print” dialog box, so you can print 
the forms that go with them.
3.	 Click OK to print the selected forms. In the “Print [forms]” dialog box that 
appears, click Print.
Because problems can occur during printing (paper jams, low toner, or smears), 
QuickBooks opens the “Print [forms] - Confirmation” dialog box after it prints 
the forms.
4.	 If the forms printed correctly, click OK to close the confirmation dialog box.
If a problem occurred, in the “Print [forms] - Confirmation” dialog box, click 
the Reprint cell for each form that didn’t print correctly. If the whole batch is 
a loss, click Select All. Either way, click OK to reprint the forms you selected. 
Printing Mailing and Shipping Labels
QuickBooks can print mailing labels to go with some of the forms you print, such 
as invoices. The trick is that you have to print the labels before you print the forms 
because, after you print the forms, they disappear from the “Select [forms] to Print” 
dialog box. Here’s how you print labels for your forms:
1.	 Choose File→Print Forms, and then choose the type of form for which you 
want labels.
QuickBooks opens the “Select [forms] to Print” dialog box (Figure 12-4) with 
all your unprinted forms selected.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
316
PRINTING 
FORMS
2.	 In the “Select [forms] to Print” dialog box, click Print Labels.
QuickBooks opens the “Select Labels to Print” dialog box and automatically 
chooses the Name option, which prints labels for the names associated with 
each form that’s waiting to print.
 TIP 	 If you’ve created forms for a specific customer type or vendor type, in the “Select Labels to Print” dialog 
box, choose the Customer Type or Vendor Type option and then, in the option’s drop-down list, select the type 
you want to print labels for. These options are better suited for printing labels not associated with your queued 
forms—for example, when you want to send a letter to your retail customers informing them of product rebates. 
Or you might use them if you process forms for retail and wholesale customers at different times of the month.
Alternatively, if you want to print labels for a mailing without an associated form (like an open-house announce­
ment) choose File→Print Forms→Labels.
3.	 To filter the printed labels by location, turn on the “with Zip Codes that 
start with” checkbox, and then type the beginning of the Zip code you want.
For example, if you’re offering a seminar for people in the Denver area, you’d 
type 801 in the box, as shown in Figure 12-5.
FIGURE 12-5
If you want to print labels for a mailing that has 
nothing to do with money (like an announcement 
about your new office location), choose File→Print 
Forms→Labels. 
When you do that, this dialog box opens so you can 
jump right to selecting the recipients.
4.	 In the “Sort labels by” box, choose Name or Zip Code.
If you use bulk mail, choose Zip Code so you can bundle your mail by Zip code 
as your bulk-mail permit requires.
5.	 To print shipping labels rather than labels that use billing addresses, turn 
on the “Print Ship To addresses where available” checkbox.
The “Print labels for inactive names” checkbox can come in handy from time to 
time—for instance, if you need to send a letter to past and present customers 
to tell them about a product recall.

When you want to send communications to different addresses for each job, 
even if the jobs are for the same customer, turn on the “Print labels for jobs” 
checkbox.
6.	 Make sure you’ve selected the labels you want, and then click OK.
QuickBooks opens the Print Labels dialog box.
7.	 If you’ve already chosen the printer and settings for labels in Printer Setup, 
click Print and you’re done.
If you want to print to different labels, in the Label Format drop-down list, choose 
the type of label you’re using. (You can find the vendor and label number—like 
Avery #5262—on the box of labels.) The drop-down list includes popular Avery 
formats and several other options.
After you print your labels, QuickBooks closes the Print Labels dialog box, and 
the “Select [forms] to Print” dialog box reappears so you can click OK to proceed 
to printing your queued forms as explained on page 308.
Printing Packing Slips
When you ship products to a customer, it’s common to include a packing slip that 
describes what should be in the shipment. In QuickBooks, you have to print each 
packing slip individually from the Create Invoices window. (The packing-slip template 
that Intuit provides is basically an invoice without prices.)
Here are the steps for printing the packing slip for an invoice:
1.	 If the Create Invoices window is already open, click the left arrow (Previ­
ous) in the window’s Main tab until you find the invoice you’re interested 
in, or click the Find button, fill in fields that identify the invoice, and then 
click Find.
To find an invoice when the Create Invoices window isn’t open, on the Home 
Page, click Customers to open the Customer Center. Next, click the Transactions 
tab on the window’s left, and then choose Invoices in the tab’s list of transaction 
types. Finally, in the table on the right, double-click the invoice you want, and 
QuickBooks opens it in the Create Invoices window.
2.	 In the Create Invoices window, click Print→Packing Slip.
QuickBooks sets the window’s Template box to the packing slip template and 
opens the Print Packing Slip dialog box, where you can set print options, if 
necessary.
3.	 Once the settings look good, click Print.
QuickBooks closes the Print Packing Slip dialog box and prints the packing slip.
4.	 Back in the Create Invoices window, click Save & Close.
QuickBooks automatically changes the Template box from the packing slip 
template back to the invoice template.

 TIP 	 If you want QuickBooks to always use a particular packing slip template, change the packing slip template 
preference as described on page 663.
Emailing Forms
If you’ve grown tired of paper cuts, then sending invoices and other forms electroni­
cally is much more satisfying. But to make your electronic sending as efficient as 
possible, be sure that all your customer records include email addresses. Otherwise, 
you’ll waste time typing email addresses one after another, and the chance of a typo 
increases with each address you type.
If you use a popular email program, such as Outlook, QuickBooks automatically uses 
that program to send forms. When you email a form as described in this section, 
QuickBooks opens new messages in your email program, which you can edit as 
you would any email. When you send the emails, they show up in your Sent Items 
folder or Sent box. You can also tell QuickBooks to use a web-based email service 
like Gmail. This section explains all your emailing options.
Choosing a Send Method
QuickBooks gives you a couple of ways to email forms: Similar to printing, you can 
email the current form or add it to a queue to send in batches:
• Send one form. To email the current form, at the top of the form window, click 
the Email button, and then choose the form’s name, such as Invoice, as shown 
in Figure 12-6. If the form has files attached in QuickBooks and you want to at­
tach those files to the email, choose “[form] and Attached Files” instead, such 
as “Invoice and Attached Files.”
FIGURE 12-6
When you click the Email 
button, you can choose 
the form’s name (Invoice, 
in this example) to email 
the form that’s open in the 
window, or choose Batch 
to email all the forms in 
your to-be-emailed queue. 
Choose “[form] and 
Attached Files” to email 
the form and any files at-
tached to it in QuickBooks. 

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers

EMAILING 
FORMS
• Sending in batches. When you turn on the Email Later checkbox at the top of 
a form window, QuickBooks adds the current form to the queue of forms that 
you’ll email all at once. You can send them by clicking the window’s Email but­
ton and then choosing Batch.
Emailing One Form
Here’s how to email a form when you’re looking at it in its window (these steps use 
the Create Invoices window as an example, but they work equally well for other 
sales forms):
1.	 In the Create Invoices window (or other form window), click the Email button 
and then choose Invoice (or the corresponding form name).
What happens when you choose Email→Invoice depends on the email program 
you use. If you use one of several popular email programs, the program opens 
and creates a new message with the fields from QuickBooks filled in and a PDF 
file of the form attached to it.
If you use web-based email (see page 665 to learn how to set it up), the “Send 
[form]” dialog box opens with the email fields filled in.
 NOTE 	 Say you attached files to a form in QuickBooks, as explained in the box on page 314 (like photos to show 
that the work you’re invoicing for is complete, or travel receipts for the reimbursable expenses on an invoice), and 
you want to attach those files to the email. To email a form and its attached files, on the form window’s Main tab, 
click Email→“[form name] and Attached Files” (“Invoice and Attached Files,” for example). The email message 
that QuickBooks creates includes a PDF file of the form and any files attached to the transaction in QuickBooks. If 
you want to attach additional files from your computer to the email, click the paper-clip icon to the right of the 
Attach box (labeled in Figure 12-7).
2.	 Modify the message in any way you want.
You can change the email addresses, subject, and email text that QuickBooks 
automatically adds.
3.	 If you use web-based email, click the “Send [form]” dialog box’s Send Now 
button. If you use a desktop email program, click its Send button.
Emailing in Batches
When you turn on the Email Later checkbox on the Main tabs of the windows for 
forms you create, QuickBooks adds them to an email queue. You can then send all 
the forms you’ve queued up in just a couple of steps:
1.	 Choose File→Send Forms or, on the Main tab of the window where you 
create the forms—such as the Create Invoices window—click Email→Batch.
QuickBooks opens the Send Forms dialog box, which lists and selects all your 
unsent forms.

You send a QuickBooks-generated message 
just as you would an email you created in 
your email program. In Outlook, for example,

QuickBooks attaches it to the email message 
as an Adobe PDF file. 
If you choose Email→“Invoice and Attached 
Files,” the invoice and any files attached to it 
in QuickBooks show up as attachments in the 
email message.
2.	 If you want to skip some of the forms, click their checkmarks to turn them off.
When you select a form in the table on the dialog box’s left, a preview of the 
message appears to the right of the table. If you want to change the message, 
simply edit it.
 NOTE 	 To the left of the Send Now button, the Send Forms window displays QuickBooks’ estimate of how 
long it will take to email the forms you’ve selected. You won’t be able to do any other work in the program until 
the emails have been sent. So if you’re on a tight deadline and don’t have time to wait, click Close and then come 
back later to send the emails.
3.	 When you’re ready, click Send Now.
You’re email program sends the emails you selected.

MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
Memorizing Transactions
If you enter the same transactions over and over, having QuickBooks memorize them 
for reuse saves time. The program can then fill in most, if not all, of the fields for 
you. Once it memorizes a transaction, all you have to do is choose the memorized 
transaction you want to reuse and make sure that the values in the new transaction 
are correct before you save it. This section shows you how to memorize transactions 
and put them to work.
Here are some examples of how you can use memorized transactions to be more 
productive:
• Memorizing bills. You can take some of the sting out of paying bills by memo­
rizing the ones that use the same info each time: bills with the same items or 
amounts, or bills that are due the same day each month, for example. If a utility 
bill is always due the same day, you can memorize the bill so QuickBooks fills 
in the vendor and account and records it on a regular schedule. When you use 
a memorized transaction like this, all you do is fill in the amount and save the 
new transaction. 
On the other hand, your office rent bill probably has all the same info each 
month—date, vendor, account, and amount—so you can memorize the bill 
and even set it up to record itself automatically. Memorized bills also come in 
handy if you reorder the same products with the same prices from a vendor. 
(See “Creating Memorized Groups of Transactions” on page 326 to learn how 
to save even more time.)
 NOTE 	 Although you can memorize bills, you can’t memorize a bill payment. The same goes for deposits 
and invoice payments, because you have to choose the bills or invoices that the payments apply to. However, 
if you create reminders (page 483) for transactions such as this, then QuickBooks reminds you when the bills or 
invoices are due to be paid.
• Memorizing charges and electronic funds transfers (EFTs). If you’ve set up 
automatic vendor payments, like a monthly health insurance premium charged 
to your credit card or your telephone bill withdrawn automatically from your 
checking account, you can memorize those transactions in QuickBooks.
• Memorizing estimates. If you’ve worked on jobs in the past and have a good 
idea of what they require, you can reuse that hard-won knowledge by memoriz­
ing an estimate with the labor hours you spend and the quantities of products 
and materials you need. The box on page 282 explains how to memorize an 
estimate to use on similar jobs in the future.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
322
MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
 TIP 	 If you reuse transactions only occasionally, you might not want to fill up the Memorized Transaction 
List with those transactions. Instead, simply duplicate a transaction whenever you need it. For example, display 
the bill you want to copy in the Enter Bills window, right-click in the window, and choose Duplicate Bill from the 
shortcut menu. (Alternatively, click “Create a Copy” at the top of the window.) Then simply make any changes 
you want, like the date and amount, and then click Save & Close.
QuickBooks can also remind you to enter a transaction—such as a recurring client 
invoice for retainers—or even add the transaction without any help from you. For 
example, if your company’s Internet service costs $259 each month and you pay it 
with an automatic credit card payment, you can tell QuickBooks to memorize that 
charge and automatically enter it each month.
Creating a Memorized Transaction
The Memorized Transactions List is an anomaly on the Lists menu because you don’t 
create memorized transactions the way you do entries on other lists. Instead, you 
tell QuickBooks to memorize existing transactions. Here’s how:
1.	 Open the window for the type of transaction you want to memorize (for 
example, the Create Invoices window for an invoice, Enter Bills for a bill, or 
Write Checks for a check).
You can memorize many kinds of transactions, including checks, credit card 
charges, bills, invoices, journal entries, estimates, and so on.
2.	 Fill in any fields that remain the same each time you use that transaction. 
If a value changes, leave its field blank or set to zero.
For example, for a bill, add the items you’re buying and their prices. If the 
quantities change from bill to bill, leave the Quantity fields blank or set to zero. 
Or, for a check, enter the payee and the account to post the expense to. If the 
amount is the same each time, fill in the amount; if the amount changes, leave 
the amount field blank. (If an amount field has a value in it, click the field, and 
then press Backspace to delete the value.) Later, when you use the memorized 
transaction, QuickBooks fills in all the fields except the ones you left blank, 
which you fill in with the correct values.
3.	 If you want QuickBooks to add the new transactions to your print or email 
queue, turn on the Print Later or Email Later checkbox.
That way, when you save a new transaction that’s based on the memorized 
transaction, the program adds the transaction to the print or email queue.
4.	 When the transaction is set up the way you want, press Ctrl+M to open the 
Memorize Transaction dialog box shown in Figure 12-8, foreground.
You can also open this dialog box by right-clicking in a transaction window, 
such as the Create Invoices window, and then choosing “Memorize [form]” 
(Memorize Invoice, Memorize Check, or whatever). Or you can click Memorize 
at the top of the window.

MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
 NOTE 	 If you’ve already memorized a transaction with the same name, the Replace Memorized Transac­
tion message box appears instead. To replace the existing memorized transaction, click Replace. To add a new 
memorized transaction, click Add; when you do, QuickBooks opens the Memorize Transaction dialog box so you 
can specify a new name and options for the memorized transaction. If you change your mind about memorizing 
the transaction, click Cancel.
FIGURE 12-8
If the quantities change 
from transaction to 
transaction, you can fill 
in the items on a bill and 
their cost but leave the 
quantities blank or set 
to zero. 
Later, when you use the 
memorized transaction, 
QuickBooks fills in all the 
fields except the ones you 
left blank or set to zero, 
which you fill in with the 
correct values.
5.	 In the Memorize Transaction dialog box’s Name field, type a name that you’ll 
recognize when you see it in the Memorized Transaction List.
QuickBooks automatically fills in the Name box with the transaction’s Payee 
name or the name in a transaction, but it’s a good idea to enter something more 
meaningful. You can use names like Monthly Telephone Bill or Health Insurance 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
324
MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
Premium for bills you pay, a customer name combined with a sales form’s name, 
or the type of retainer, such as Full-time Programming Contract.
6.	 Tell QuickBooks whether you want it to remind you to enter transactions.
Choosing the “Add to my Reminders List” option is great for recurring transac­
tions: QuickBooks adds the memorized transaction to the Reminders List (page 
483) and prompts you when it’s time to enter the next occurrence (though you 
can choose to skip the transaction). If you select this option, specify how often 
you want to be reminded and pick the next reminder date. For example, if you 
pay your phone bill on the 10th of each month, in the How Often box, choose 
Monthly, and in the Next Date box, pick the 10th of the next month.
If you don’t use the transaction on a regular schedule (like one for snowplowing), 
choose the Do Not Remind Me option, and QuickBooks won’t add the memo­
rized transaction to the Reminders List. When you want to use the transaction 
again, press Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transaction List window, select the 
transaction, and then click Enter Transaction.
For transactions that are identical from occurrence to occurrence, such as 
your bill for rent, choose the Automate Transaction Entry option. Then use the 
Days In Advance To Enter field to tell QuickBooks how many days before the 
due date to enter the transaction. (Providing a few days of lead time for bills 
helps you avoid late payments and insufficient-funds charges from your bank.) 
When that date arrives, QuickBooks records the transaction. When you choose 
Automate Transaction Entry, the Number Remaining box becomes active so 
you can type how many payments remain, which is ideal for loan payments 
that—thankfully—don’t go on forever.
 TIP 	 You can also set up groups of memorized transactions and enter them all at once; you’ll learn how 
starting on page 326.
7.	 To memorize the transaction, click OK.
QuickBooks adds the bill to the Memorized Transaction List, closes the Memorize 
Transaction dialog box, and returns you to the form window.
8.	 If you want to save the transaction you created, click Save & Close.
If you created an invoice or other form simply to set up a memorized transac­
tion, click Clear in the form window, and then click the window’s Close button 
(the X in its upper right) to close it without saving the form.
The next section explains how to use memorized transactions.
Using a Memorized Transaction
How you generate a new transaction from one in the Memorized Transaction List 
depends on whether you’ve opted for a reminder, no reminder, or total automation. 
This section describes all three methods.

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers
325
MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
RECORDING A TRANSACTION WHEN YOU’RE REMINDED
If you create a memorized transaction and tell QuickBooks to remind you (by choos­
ing the “Add to my Reminders List” option) when the scheduled date arrives, the 
program adds the bill to the Reminders List (page 483). (If the Reminders List displays 
only the Memorized Transactions Due heading, click it to display the transactions 
that are scheduled to be recorded.)
Here are the steps for turning a reminder into a transaction:
1.	 In the Reminders window, below the Memorized Transactions Due heading, 
double-click a memorized transaction.
The Memorized Transaction List window opens with the transaction selected 
in the list.
2.	 At the bottom of the Memorized Transaction List window, click Enter 
Transaction. 
QuickBooks opens it in its corresponding transaction window (like Enter Bills 
for a memorized bill). The transaction that QuickBooks creates contains only 
the memorized information.
3.	 Make any changes you want, fill in any empty fields, and then click Save & 
Close.
The transaction window closes, and the memorized transaction no longer ap­
pears in the Reminders window.
 TIP 	 For reminders that are hard to miss, tell QuickBooks to display the Reminders List each time you open the 
current company file. That way, when you open that company file, the program opens a Start Up box that asks if 
you want to enter memorized transactions; click Now to add them. (It also opens the Reminders List.) To set this 
up, choose Edit→Preferences→Reminders and, on the My Preferences tab, turn on the “Show Reminders List 
when opening a Company file” checkbox.
RECORDING AN OCCASIONAL TRANSACTION
When you memorize a transaction that you use only occasionally or that occurs 
on an irregular schedule, choosing Do Not Remind Me stores the transaction in the 
Memorized Transaction List in case you need it. If you memorize a transaction like 
this, you need a way to create a new transaction based on it. (You’ll also use this 
technique if you set up a memorized transaction on a schedule but want to create 
one right away.) Here’s how to use a memorized transaction at any time:
1.	 Choose Lists→Memorized Transaction List or press Ctrl+T.
The Memorized Transaction List window opens.
2.	 Select the transaction you want, and then click the Enter Transaction button.
The corresponding transaction window opens, such as Create Invoices, Write 
Checks, or Enter Credit Card Charges.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
326
MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
3.	 Make any changes you want, and then click Save & Close.
That’s all there is to it!
RECORDING A TRANSACTION AUTOMATICALLY
If you create a memorized transaction and choose the Automate Transaction Entry 
option, that’s exactly what QuickBooks does: When the next scheduled date for the 
transaction arrives, QuickBooks records a new transaction.
Editing a Memorized Transaction
If you want to change a memorized transaction’s recurrence schedule or reminder 
settings, press Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transaction List window, select the 
transaction you want to edit, and then press Ctrl+E (or, at the bottom of the window, 
click Memorized Transaction→Edit Memorized Transaction). The Schedule Memo­
rized Transaction dialog box appears with settings for reminders and the recurrence 
schedule (page 324).
If you want to edit the info within a memorized transaction, such as the items and 
services sold, you have to edit the existing transaction and then rememorize it. 
Here’s how:
1.	 Press Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transaction List window. Select the 
transaction, and then click the Enter Transaction button.
QuickBooks opens the corresponding transaction window and creates a new 
transaction based on the memorized one.
2.	 Make the changes you want, and then press Ctrl+M to rememorize it with 
the changes you’ve made.
The Replace Memorized Transaction message box appears.
3.	 Click Replace.
The edited transaction takes the place of the previous one in the Memorized 
Transaction List. (If you want to save both the old and new versions, click Add 
instead.)
Creating Memorized Groups of Transactions
The first day of the month is the nemesis of bill payers everywhere because so many 
bills are due then. QuickBooks can’t ease the pain of watching your money go out 
the door, but it can ease the burden of entering all those bills in your company file. 
Memorized bills are a start, but why enter individual memorized bills when you can 
enter several at once? 
Fortunately, QuickBooks lets you set up memorized transaction groups that act like 
their individual memorized counterparts—the program can remind you about all the 
bills due on a specific day or even enter all the recurring transactions automatically. 
(Memorized groups work equally well for recurring invoices.)

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers
327
MEMORIZING 
TRANSACTIONS
You might wonder how to add a memorized transaction to a group when you open 
the Memorize Transaction dialog box (page 322) for the very first time; the “Add 
to Group” option and the Group Name box are visible but grayed out. To add a 
memorized transaction to a group, you have to first create a memorized group. 
Here’s how you do that:
1.	 Press Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transaction List. At the bottom of the 
window, click Memorized Transaction→New Group.
QuickBooks opens the New Memorized Transaction Group dialog box. It’s 
identical to the Memorize Transaction dialog box except that it doesn’t include 
the “Add to Group” option or Group Name box.
2.	 Name the group something meaningful like Monthly Bills, and fill in the other 
fields as you would for a memorized transaction (page 324).
Tell QuickBooks how and when you want to be reminded about the bills in this 
group (if at all).
3.	 Click OK to save the group.
Now that the group exists, you can add individual transactions to it.
4.	 To add an existing memorized transaction to the group, in the Memorized 
Transaction List window, select the transaction you want to add, and then 
press Ctrl+E to edit it.
The Schedule Memorized Transaction dialog box opens.
5.	 Select the “Add to Group” option and then, in the Group Name box, choose 
the group you just created. When you’re done, click OK.
When you add a memorized transaction to a group, QuickBooks tucks the 
transaction underneath the group in the Memorized Transaction List, as shown 
in Figure 12-9.
FIGURE 12-9
Memorized transactions 
take on the schedule and

Days In Advance To Enter 
settings are grayed out.

FINDING 
TRANSACTIONS
 TIP 	 Create separate memorized groups for bills with consistent amounts and for ones whose amounts 
vary. That way, you can set up the unvarying memorized group with the Automate Transaction Entry option so 
QuickBooks simply adds all the bills in that group to your list of bills to be paid without any intervention from 
you. Then you can set the second memorized group to use the “Add to my Reminders List” option so you can go 
through each bill and fill in the amount before you record it.
Finding Transactions
When you want to answer a customer’s question about what she owes, it’s easier 
if you have the invoice in front of you. The Create Invoices window shows only one 
invoice at a time, but there are several ways to find a specific invoice out of the 
hundreds you’ve sent. Whether you want to find pesky overdue invoices, purchase 
orders, or paychecks, the Customer, Vendor, and Employee Centers (and the In­
ventory Center if you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise) make it easy to find 
transactions for a particular customer, vendor, employee, or item. And the Item List 
window has a few tools for finding specific items.
QuickBooks also offers two additional ways to search. The Search feature scours 
every inch of QuickBooks and your company file. The Find feature (which you can 
access most easily by pressing Ctrl+F), on the other hand, is best suited for more 
precise searches—to find a particular invoice number, transactions related to a 
specific customer, invoices overdue more than a certain number of days, and so on. 
This section explains how to use all these features.
Searching with QuickBooks’ Centers
The Customer Center is a quick way to answer basic questions about your customers, 
like “What invoices are unpaid?” and “Does the customer have any credits avail­
able?” Likewise, you can track down bills, bill payments, and other vendor-related 
transactions in the Vendor Center. The Employee Center performs similar tasks for 
transactions like paychecks and non-payroll transactions. And if you use QuickBooks 
Premier or Enterprise, you can use the Inventory Center to find out what’s going on 
with your inventory. (See page 338 and page 44, respectively, to learn how to use 
Income Tracker and the new Insights feature to track down transactions.)
Here are ways you can use QuickBooks’ centers to find transactions, using the 
Customer Center as an example (to open it, on the Home Page, click the Customers 
icon, or choose Customers→Customer Center):
• Display transactions for any customer or job. On the Transactions tab on 
the left side of the center, click the type of transaction you want to search for. 
When you do, the right side of the center lists all the transactions of that type. 
You can use the Filter By menu above the list to see only open transactions or 
ones within a certain date range.

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers

FINDING 
TRANSACTIONS
• Filter the list of customers. To narrow the Customer:Job List to those that fit 
the criteria you want, on the Customers & Jobs tab, click the first unlabeled box 
(it’s usually set to Active Customers). In the drop-down list, choose one of the 
entries, like Customers with Open Balances, Customers with Overdue Invoices, 
or Customers with Almost Due Invoices.
• Find a customer. If you have trouble finding a customer on the Customers & Jobs 
tab, in the tab’s second unlabeled box, type part of the customer’s name and 
then click the “Find in common fields” button, which has a magnifying glass on it.
• Review a customer’s account. In the upper-right part of the Customer Center 
are several links you can click to see various things about a customer’s account:
—
— QuickReport shows all transactions for the customer within the date range 
you specify.
—
— Open Balance generates a report of all the Accounts Receivable transac­
tions that contributed to the customer’s current balance, like invoices and 
payments.
—
— Show Estimates generates a report of any estimates you’ve created for 
that customer or job.
—
— Customer Snapshot opens the Company Snapshot window to the Customer 
tab, where you can see statistics like the average days the customer takes 
to pay, total sales this year, and total sales for the same period last year.
• Display the transactions for a customer. When you select a customer on the 
Customers & Jobs tab, the transactions for that customer appear in the Trans­
actions tab in the lower-right part of the Customer Center. To see a specific 
type of transaction, in the Show drop-down list above the transaction table, 
choose the transaction type like Invoices or Refunds, as shown in Figure 12-10. 
QuickBooks initially displays all the transactions of that type, but you can filter 
them using these techniques:
—
— Filter transactions by status. In the Transactions tab’s Filter By drop-
down menu, choose a category like Open Invoices or Overdue Invoices. 
The choices in this menu vary depending on the transaction type. For 
example, if you search for refunds, the menu includes All Refunds, Cash/
Check Refunds, and Credit Card Refunds options.
—
— Filter transaction by date range. In the Transactions tab’s Date drop-down 
menu, choose a period. Your choices here are the same as the ones you 
can choose for reports (page 591).
—
— Open a transaction. Double-click a transaction in the Transactions tab’s 
table to open the corresponding window to that transaction.

The Item List window has its own abbreviated search feature: You type what you’re 
looking for (such as an item name or keyword) and the field you want to search, and 
then QuickBooks filters the list for matching results. Here’s how to search for an item:
1.	 Open the Item List window by choosing Lists→Item List or, on the Home 
Page, clicking Items & Services.
2.	 In the “Look for” box, type the text or value you want to find.
If you type more than one word, QuickBooks looks for items that contain the 
whole phrase you typed. For example, enter fiber optic to find all your fiber-
optic electronic devices.
3.	 In the “in” drop-down list, choose the field you want to search.
QuickBooks automatically selects “All fields” here. To narrow your search, 
choose Item Name/Number, Description (Sales), Purchase Description, Man. 
Part Number, or another field. You can also choose “Custom fields” to search 
fields you’ve created (page 78).
4.	 Click Search.

window or drag one of its corners to enlarge it. Turning on this checkbox tells 
QuickBooks to search for the new search term only in the items currently dis­

The QuickBooks Search feature can look through your company file or the program’s 
help files, although it automatically searches only your company file. If you want to 
find something in your company file, simply type in a few key words or values, and 
it combs through your entire company file for them. For example, type webcam and 
QuickBooks looks for that value in your transactions, Customer:Job List, Vendor List, 
other name records, items, descriptions, notes, and memos. But if you’re trying to 
find information about a QuickBooks feature, type the feature’s name in the Search 
box, choose Help in the box’s drop-down list, and Search tracks down information 
about it in QuickBooks’ Help files.
 TIP 	 The Search feature is quick and easy if you want to search by date range or fairly simple filters, such as 
a specific amount. But if you have really specific search criteria, like invoices that are more than 30 days overdue 
and more than $10,000, the Find feature (explained on page 332) is a better tool.
Here’s how to use Search:
1.	 Type the value you want to look for in the Search box, which is at the top 
of the left icon bar or the right end of the top icon bar (see page 30 for info 
on the icon bars).
As you type in the Search box, the program displays a drop-down list with 
suggested and recent search terms. For example, if you type “ener” because 
you’re looking for your customer Energetic Events, the drop-down list may 
display “energetic” and the Customer Name value “energeticevents001.” If the 
term or value you’re looking for appears in the drop-down list, click the entry 
you want to select it.
2.	 Click the Search button (which looks like a magnifying glass) or press Enter.
The Search window (shown in Figure 12-11) opens. (If you’ve hidden the icon bar, 
you can open this window by choosing Edit→Search or pressing F3.)

Below the Search box at the top of this 
window, you see a summary of the results, 
such as where QuickBooks found the 
results. 
If you get too many results, you can filter 
the list by clicking the type of result you 
want in the Show Results From section, 
such as Transactions. The results list on the 
right then displays only that type of result.
3.	 To filter the results, below the “Show Results From” heading, click the type 
of result you want.
To see all transactions that matched your criteria, click Transactions. To search 
for a specific type, click the type, such as Invoices or Bills. You can also choose a 
date range to specify a period to search. If you’re looking for an amount, choose 
an option to look for values equal to, less than, or greater than the amount.
4.	 Put your cursor over a search result.
Icons appear below the search result that represent the actions that you can 
perform, like Open or Receive Payment for an invoice (see Figure 12-11), or Edit 
for an item in the Item List. Click the icon for the action you want.
Using the Find Feature
QuickBooks’ Find feature is ideal for finding transactions that match several crite­
ria. For example, it lets you search for all invoices within a certain date range that 
include a product you’ve upgraded, or all the open invoices for work performed by 
one partner (if you use classes to track that kind of thing). In fact, the Find feature 

Chapter 12: Transaction Timesavers
333

TRANSACTIONS
can mine every transaction field except Description (to search descriptions, use the 
Search feature instead [page 33]).
The Find window has a Simple tab for straightforward searches and an Advanced 
tab where you can build searches as detailed as you want. QuickBooks remembers 
which one you used for your last search and displays that tab the next time you 
open the window.
FINDING MADE SIMPLE
Here’s how to use the simple version of the Find feature:
1.	 Choose Edit→Find or press Ctrl+F.
If you have a form window (like Create Invoices) open, click the Find button at 
the window’s top left to open a smaller version of the Find window’s Simple 
tab. Click Advanced in this simplified dialog box to open the full-blown Find 
window. If you don’t have any form windows open, the full Find window opens 
automatically.
2.	 In the Find window, click the Simple tab if it’s not already selected.
The Transaction Type box at the top of the tab is set to Invoice, and all the other 
fields are blank.
3.	 In the Transaction Type drop-down list, choose a type like Purchase Order 
or Bill.
The search fields are almost identical no matter which transaction type you 
choose, with a few exceptions, as explained in Figure 12-12. From, To, and Amount 
fields appear for every type.
4.	 Fill in the values you want to search for, and then click the Find button.
You can fill in as many or as few fields as you want. When you click Find, any 
matching transactions appear in the table at the bottom of the window. Double-
click a transaction to open it in its corresponding window, like Create Invoices 
for an invoice.
5.	 To clear all the fields and start a new search, click Reset.
When you’re done, click Close.
ADVANCED FIND METHODS
The Find window’s Advanced tab lets you search any transaction field. You can 
even build up a set of filters to locate exactly the transaction you want. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Edit→Find (or press Ctrl+F), and then click the Advanced tab. (If a 
simplified Find dialog box opens, click its Advanced button.)
The Advanced tab starts with an almost-clean slate every time you open the 
Find window—though the right-hand Filter list always starts with Posting Status 
set to Either.

In the Find window, the 
label above the first field 
after Transaction Type 
changes to reflect the type 
you choose. For example, 
if you select Bill for the 
transaction type, the next

Vendor. 
The second-to-last field 
also varies depending on 
the transaction type; for 
example, it’s Invoice # for 
an invoice, Ref. No. for 
a bill, and P.O. No. for a 
purchase order.
2.	 In the Find window’s left-hand Filter list (Figure 12-13), choose the first 
field you want to search.
Fields appear in alphabetical order. If you’ve turned on multiple currencies, 
you’ll see Currency and Foreign Amount options listed, too.
3.	 To the right of the left-hand Filter list, select settings to specify how you 
want to search the selected field.
These settings change depending on the field you select. For example, if you 
choose TransactionType in the left-hand Filter list, you see only a single drop-
down list of QuickBooks transaction types. Choosing Date in the left-hand Filter 
list displays a drop-down list of time periods, along with From and To boxes to 
specify dates. And selecting Aging in the left-hand Filters list gives you options 
to help find late invoices (=, <=, and >=); for instance, you can find invoices that 
are 30 or more days late by choosing the >= option and typing 30 in the box.
4.	 To add another filter to your search, repeat steps 2 and 3.
You can add as many filters as you want. The window’s Current Choices table 
lists the fields you’re searching and what you’re searching for in each one.

CHAPTER
13
I
n addition to performing work, invoicing customers, and collecting payments, you 
also have to keep track of who owes you how much (known as Accounts Receivable) 
and when the money is due. Sure, you can tack on finance charges to light a fire 
under your customers’ accounting departments, but such charges are rarely enough 
to make up for the time and effort you spend collecting overdue payments. Far more 
preferable are customers who pay on time without reminders, gentle or otherwise.
Because companies need money to keep things running, you’ll have to spend some 
time keeping track of your Accounts Receivable and the payments that come in. In 
this chapter, you’ll learn the ins and outs of tracking what customers owe, receiving 
payments from them, and dinging them if they don’t pay on time. You’ll get up to 
speed on Income Tracker (which Intuit introduced in QuickBooks 2014), a handy 
dashboard that shows estimates you’ve created, how much customers owe—both 
overdue and not—and what’s been paid in the past 30 days.
In contrast to invoices, sales receipts are the simplest and most immediate sales 
forms in QuickBooks. When your customers pay in full at the time of the sale—at 
your retail store, for example—you can create a sales receipt so the customer has a 
record of the purchase and payment. At the same time, QuickBooks posts the money 
from the sale into your bank account (in QuickBooks, anyway) or the Undeposited 
Funds account. (Sales receipts work only when customers pay in full, because that 
type of sales form can’t handle previous customer payments and balances.) In this 
chapter, you’ll learn how to create sales receipts for one sale at a time and to sum­
marize a day’s worth of merchandising.

Receivables Aging
You don’t have to do anything special to create Accounts Receivable—they’re the 
by-product of invoicing your customers. But receivables that are growing long in the 
tooth are the first signs of potential collection problems. Fortunately, with Quick­
Books’ Income Tracker, Company Snapshot, Customer Center, and built-in reports, 
you have four ways to check the state of your Accounts Receivable.
 NOTE 	 You can’t use Income Tracker if you have multiple currencies turned on (page 656). When that prefer­
ence is turned on, the Income Tracker entry doesn’t appear in the Customers menu. And in QuickBooks Pro and 
Premier, only users with full access to Sales and Accounts Receivables features (page 726) can use Income Tracker.
Viewing Receivables with Income Tracker
Income Tracker (choose Customers→Income Tracker or click Income Tracker in either 
icon bar to open it), shown in Figure 13-1, is the best of both worlds: It provides the 
big picture of your unbilled, outstanding, and paid income and lists the transactions 
that contribute to those high-level numbers. Income Tracker also offers time-saving 
features for invoicing customers and collecting the money they owe you. 
 NOTE 	 The new Insights tab (page 44) on the Home Page has an Income section that includes Income Tracker’s 
overview bars for open invoices, overdue invoices, and payments made during the past 30 days. To display the 
full-blown Income Tracker, simply click any of those bars.
Here’s what each part of the Income Tracker window shows you:
• Estimates. The blue box at the window’s top left shows the total value of esti­
mates you’ve created. Although the label above the box reads “Unbilled,” this 
value doesn’t really represent unbilled income. Estimates are merely potential 
income. Customers have to approve those estimates and you have to perform 
the work or sell the goods before you can turn that money into unbilled income. 
In addition, you might create multiple estimates for the same customer and job 
to see which one is the winner. 
• Sales Orders. You see this light-blue box only if you have QuickBooks Premier 
or Enterprise; it shows the total value of open sales orders.
• Time & Expenses. This dark-blue box is a great way to catch billable time and 
expenses that you haven’t added to invoices yet. It shows the total value of un­
billed time and expenses and the number of records that contribute to that total.
 TIP 	 In QuickBooks 2015, you can choose whether to hide or display some of Income Tracker’s boxes by clicking 
the Settings icon (the gear) at the window’s upper right. To hide estimates or unbilled time and expenses, turn off 
the Estimates and “Time and Expenses” checkboxes, respectively. (If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, 
you can also turn off the Sales Orders box.)

AGING
FIGURE 13-1
The panel at the top of the 
Income Tracker window 
provides an income 
overview. The table below 
it lists the transactions 
that make up the overall 
totals. 
You can filter the 
transaction table in dif-
ferent ways: by customer, 
transaction type, status, or 
date. You can even process 
transactions in this win-
dow, for example, receiv-
ing payment on an open 
invoice, as shown here.
• Open Invoices. The orange box below the Unpaid heading shows the total 
amount on your open invoices. This is current income that your customers 
owe—that is, the invoiced income that isn’t due yet.
• Overdue. The red hue of this box emphasizes the total amount that’s overdue 
from your customers. If that number is larger than you’d like, filter the transac­
tion list (you’ll learn how in a sec) to track down the customers you need to 
nudge into paying.
• Paid Last 30 Days. The green box at the window’s top right displays how much 
your customers paid you in the last 30 days. The label at the bottom of the box 
tells you how many payments are included in that total.
• The transaction table. The transactions listed in the Income Tracker window 
are the ones that contribute to the totals at the top of the window. For example, 
the number in the orange Open Invoices box is the total of all the open invoices 
in the table. The number in the red Overdue box is the total of all the table’s 
overdue invoices. The transactions with the word “Paid” in their Status cells 
make up the total in the green Paid Last 30 Days box. And the estimates in the 
table contribute to the total in the blue Estimates box.
And here’s what you can do in the Income Tracker window:
• Filter transactions. Say that business is booming and Income Tracker’s table 
is awash with transactions. You can filter the table to drill down and see, for 
example, all the overdue invoices for the last quarter. To see transactions for a 
specific customer, click the down arrow to the Customer:Job box’s right, and 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

AGING
then, in the drop-down list, choose the customer or job you want. Choose an 
entry in the Type drop-down list to show only a specific type of transaction, 
like invoices or received payments. The Status drop-down list lets you filter the 
table to show open, overdue, or paid transactions (alternatively, you can click 
one of the colored bars at the top of the window to filter for that status). And 
the Date drop-down list lets you filter by date range.
• Sort transactions. You can sort the transactions in Income Tracker’s table by 
clicking any of the table’s column headings. (QuickBooks initially sorts the table 
by date from the most recent to the earliest.) For example, click the Due Date 
heading to sort transactions by due date. When you click a heading, QuickBooks 
sorts the table in ascending order (alphabetically, from smallest to largest values, 
or from earliest to most recent dates, depending on the type of information in 
the column). To sort in descending order, simply click the heading again.
• Take action. Income Tracker makes it easy to take the next step with your 
transactions. For instance, if you just snagged a customer payment from your 
post office box, you can start the receive-payment process right in the Income 
Tracker window. To do that, click the appropriate invoice’s Action cell, click the 
down arrow that appears, and then choose Receive Payments from the drop-
down list shown in Figure 13-1. Or choose Print or Email from the drop-down list 
to print or email the invoice. For estimates, the Action drop-down list includes 
additional options like “Convert to Invoice” (page 282) and “Mark as Inactive” 
(page 281). To open a transaction in its corresponding window, just double-click 
it or select the transaction in the table, click Manage Transactions at the bottom 
of the window, and then choose Edit Highlighted Row in the drop-down menu.
 NOTE 	 You can also create new transactions from within Income Tracker. Click the Manage Transactions 
button, and then, beneath the menu’s Create New heading, choose the type of transaction you want to create.
• Print transactions in batches. You can also print several transactions at a 
time (invoices, sales receipts, and credit memos or refunds) from the Income 
Tracker window. For example, suppose you want to print new copies of all the 
invoices that are overdue to nudge your customers about paying them. To do 
that, click the red Overdue bar at the top of the window to display the overdue 
transactions. Next, in the table’s first column, turn on the checkboxes for all the 
transactions you want to print. Then click the down arrow to the right of the 
Batch Actions button and choose the type of transaction; QuickBooks opens 
the “Print [forms]” dialog box. (See page 308 to learn how to print forms.)

RECEIVABLES 
AGING
 NOTE 	 Although Income Tracker makes it easy to stay on top of overdue invoices, some folks prefer the 
Collections Center, which includes an Overdue tab that shows customers with overdue invoices, the number of 
days overdue, and the customers’ phone numbers. You can also send out email reminders by clicking “Select and 
Send Email” near the top right of the Collections Center window. To open the Collections Center, in the Customer 
Center’s toolbar, click Collections Center. (If you don’t see this option, that means you need to turn on this feature. 
To do that, choose Edit→Preferences→Sales & Customers, and then click the Company Preferences tab. In the 
Collections Center section, turn on the Enable Collections Center checkbox.) 
Getting a High-Level View with the Company Snapshot
Another handy feature is the Company Snapshot window (Figure 13-2), which can 
show each customer’s balance. To open it, choose Company→Company Snapshot, 
and then click the window’s Company tab if it’s not already selected. (When you 
want to see more detail about receivables, turn to QuickBooks’ built-in aging reports 
instead; they’re described in the next section.)
FIGURE 13-2
The Customers Who Owe 
Money section shows 
who owes you money,

display it in the Company 
Snapshot.) If the due date 
is in the past, it’s displayed 
in red text. 
To record a payment, click 
the Receive Payments link 
(circled).
Viewing Receivables Detail in the Customer Center
Yet another way to view your Accounts Receivable is in the Customer Center (choose 
Customers→Customer Center or, on the Home Page, click Customers). The window’s 
Customers & Jobs tab lists your customers and jobs and the balance owed by each 
one. If you select a customer or job in the list, you can see the invoices or other sales 
transactions that generated the open balance on the right side of the window, as 
shown in Figure 13-3.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

RECEIVABLES 
AGING
FIGURE 13-3
To see the transactions 
that make up a customer’s 
balance, select the cus-
tomer on the Customers & 
Jobs tab. On the Transac-
tions tab in the lower-right 
part of the window, in 
the Show drop-down list, 
choose Invoices; and in the 
tab’s Filter By drop-down 
list, choose Open Invoices, 
as shown here. A value 
in an invoice’s Aging cell 
indicates the number of 
days it’s past its due date.
 NOTE 	 In the Customer Center, if the customer’s balance on the Customers & Jobs tab doesn’t equal the total 
in the Transactions table, that’s a clue that not all transactions that affect the customer’s balance are displayed 
in the table. For example, if you’ve tweaked the Transactions table so that it lists only overdue invoices, the total 
at the bottom of the table’s Amount column is only for overdue invoices, whereas the balance on the Customers 
& Jobs tab is the customer’s total balance (overdue and not) taking into account invoices, statement charges, 
credit memos, payments, and so on.
Accounts Receivable Aging Reports
Aging reports tell you how many days have passed since you sent each open invoice, 
and viewing them is the first step in keeping your Accounts Receivable from grow­
ing overly ripe. It’s a fact of business life that the longer a customer hasn’t paid, the 
more likely it is that you’ll never see that money. Taking action before an account 
lags too far behind limits bad debts and protects your profits. (The box on page 
344 describes a way to gauge how well you manage your Accounts Receivable.)
QuickBooks includes two built-in aging reports: A/R Aging Summary and A/R Aging 
Detail. These reports show how much your customers owe for the current billing 
period (invoices that are less than 30 days old), as well as unpaid invoices from 
previous periods (invoices that are between 1 and 30 days late, 31 to 60 days late, 
61 to 90 days late, and more than 90 days late). The Accounts Receivable Graph can 
also show you some useful info. Here’s a bit more about each one:

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
343
RECEIVABLES 
AGING
• A/R Aging Summary. For a quick look at how much money your custom­
ers owe you and how old your receivables are, choose Reports→Customers 
& Receivables→A/R Aging Summary. To see the transactions that make up 
a customer’s total, put your cursor over a summary value. When the cursor 
changes to a magnifying glass like the one circled in Figure 13-4, double-click 
the transaction.
FIGURE 13-4
This report lists customers 
and jobs and shows the 
money they owe in each 
aging period. Ideally, you 
should see more zero bal-
ances as you look at older 
periods. When you’re on a 
mission to collect overdue 
accounts, start with the 
oldest aging period on the 
right side of the report.
 NOTE 	 If you work with more than one currency, the A/R Aging reports and the Accounts Receivable Graph 
use your home currency for all values. But you can modify the A/R Aging Summary report to see transactions in 
the currencies in which they were recorded: In the report’s window, click Customize Report. On the Display tab 
of the Modify Report dialog box that appears, below the “Display amounts in” label, select the “The transaction 
currency” option, and then click OK.
• A/R Aging Detail. To see Accounts Receivable transactions for all your cus­
tomers categorized by age, choose Reports→Customers & Receivables→A/R 
Aging Detail.
• Accounts Receivable Graph. This graph doesn’t show as much detail as either 
of the A/R Aging reports, but its visual nature makes aging problems stand out. 
To display it, choose Reports→Customers & Receivables→Accounts Receivable 
Graph. Ideally, you want to see the bars in the graph get smaller or disappear 
completely as the number of days overdue increases. To see more details for a 
particular period, double-click a bar in the graph to open a QuickZoom Graph. 
To see more detail about a customer, double-click the customer’s name in the 
legend or double-click the slice of the pie chart that corresponds to the customer.

POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Watching Receivables Trends
In the investment world, financial analysts study trends in 
Accounts Receivable. For example, if Accounts Receivable are 
increasing faster than sales, it means that customers aren’t 
paying for everything they bought, either because they’re on 
thin ice financially or they don’t like the products or services 
they’ve received.
One way to measure how good a job your company does 
collecting receivables is with days sales outstanding, which 
is the number of days’ worth of sales it takes to match your 
Accounts Receivable. If Accounts Receivable grow faster than 
sales (meaning customers aren’t paying), you’ll see this value 
get larger. Here’s the formula:
Days sales outstanding = 
Accounts receivable / (Sales/365)
Days sales outstanding below 60 (in other words, collecting 
Accounts Receivable with two months’ worth of sales) is good. 
But if your company is in the retail business, you should aspire 
to the performance of high-volume giants such as Walmart and 
Home Depot, who, according to their annual reports, collect 
their receivables in less than a week.
Seeing What Customers Owe with Reports
Aging reports aren’t the only goodies you can generate in QuickBooks. To see all the 
reports associated with customers and what they owe, choose Reports→Customers 
& Receivables. Here’s an overview of when it makes sense to use these reports:
• Customer Balance Summary. This report shows the balances for each job and 
the customer’s total balance. You can find this same total balance information 
on the Customer Center’s Customers & Jobs tab, but unlike that tab, you can 
easily print this report.
 NOTE 	 In QuickBooks 2015, reports have been spiffed up with new fonts and shading to make them easier 
to read (see page 584).
• Customer Balance Detail. This report shows every transaction that makes up 
customers’ balances, so it can get pretty long. It lists every transaction (such as 
invoices, payments, statement charges, and credit memos) for every customer 
and job in your company file, whether the customer is late or not. To inspect a 
transaction’s details, double-click anywhere in the transaction’s row to see it in 
its corresponding window (Create Invoices for an invoice, for example). If you’d 
rather see the transactions for just one customer, open the Customer Center, 
select the customer, and then, on the right side of the window, click the Open 
Balance link.
• Open Invoices. This report includes unpaid invoices and statement charges, as 
well as payments and unapplied credits, so you can see if a payment or unapplied 
credit closes out a customer’s balance. This report is sorted and subtotaled for 

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
345
RECEIVING 
PAYMENTS 
FOR INVOICED 
INCOME
each customer and job, so you can find an unpaid invoice quickly. When you 
find the invoice you want, double-click anywhere in its row to open it.
• Collections Report. When you’re on a mission to collect the money that’s owed 
to you, this report shows the past-due invoices and statement charges by cus­
tomer and job, along with the due date and number of days that the transaction 
is past due. If a customer has questions about a transaction, double-click the 
transaction’s row to view it in detail.
 TIP 	 When customers have pushed their credit limits—and your patience—too far, you can easily create 
collection letters by merging information for overdue customers with mail-merge collection letters in Word. See 
page 672 for details.
• Average Days to Pay Summary/Average Days to Pay. These reports show 
how long customers take to pay your invoices. The summary report lists each 
customer and the average days it took it to pay based on all transactions. If you 
notice customers going far beyond your limits, you might consider increasing 
your finance charges or looking for new customers.
• Unbilled Costs by Job. Another way you might leave money on the table is 
by forgetting to add reimbursable expenses to invoices. Run this report to see 
whether there are expenses you haven’t billed; if there are, the report lists the 
type of expense and when you incurred it, among other info. If you spot older 
expenses that you haven’t yet billed, add them to the next invoice (page 252).
Receiving Payments for Invoiced Income
To record a payment, click Receive Payments on the Home Page or choose 
Customers→Receive Payments. Either way, QuickBooks opens the Receive Pay­
ments window, which handles full and partial payments, early payment discounts, 
credits, and downloaded online payments.
The Receive Payments window works for most payments, but you record some 
types of payments in other places. Here are the windows that can record payments 
and when to use them:
• Receive Payments. When customers send you money to pay their invoices or 
their statement balances, on the Home Page, click Receive Payments to record 
the payment as explained below. This window is for full or partial payments that 
you receive after you’ve made a sale. It lets you apply early payment discounts 
and credits for returns, as well as downloaded online payments. (See page 370 
to find out how to record the deposits for any type of payment.)
• Create Invoices. As explained in the box on page 350, this window is where 
you record a partial payment that you receive before you prepare an invoice. 
These payments appear on the next invoice you create and reduce its balance. 
And if you happen to receive a payment while you’re preparing the customer’s

next invoice in this window, you can add the payment to the invoice right then. 
You can also apply available credits in this window.
• Enter Sales Receipts. When your customers pay in full at the time of sale (with 
cash, check, or credit card), record payments in this window (page 362).
To record full or partial payments (with or without discounts or credits) that you 
receive from customers, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Customers→Receive Payments or, on the Home Page, click Re­
ceive Payments. (Alternatively, in the Customer Center, select the cus­
tomer who sent a payment, and then, in the window’s toolbar, choose New 
Transactions→Receive Payments.)
QuickBooks opens the Receive Payments window.
2.	 In the Received From box, choose the customer or the job for which you 
received a payment, as shown in Figure 13-5.
If the customer sent a payment that covers more than one job, choose the cus­
tomer’s name rather than a job. QuickBooks then adds the Job column to the 
Receive Payments window’s table and fills in the rows with all the outstanding 
invoices for all the customer’s jobs. When an invoice applies to a specific job, 
the job’s name appears in the table. If the cell in the Job column is blank, the 
invoice applies directly to the customer, not to a job.
 TIP 	 Income Tracker (page 338) can help you record payments more quickly. In the Income Tracker window 
(Customers→Income Tracker), click the Action cell in the row for the invoice for which you received a payment, 
and then choose Receive Payment on the drop-down menu. QuickBooks opens a new payment transaction in the 
Receive Payments window and fills in the Customer:Job box with the customer or job associated with the invoice 
you selected.
3.	 In the Payment Amount box, type the amount of the payment (if the cus­
tomer uses a foreign currency, type the amount received in the foreign 
currency).
If you select a customer who is set up to use a foreign currency, QuickBooks 
automatically sets the A/R Account box to the Accounts Receivable account for 
that currency. For euros, for example, you’ll see “Accounts Receivable - EUR.”
 TIP 	 If you choose a job and don’t see the invoice you expect, in the Received From box, choose the customer 
to see all invoices for that customer and its jobs. If the invoice is assigned to the wrong customer or the wrong 
job, edit the invoice (page 293), and then choose the correct job in the Received From box.

FIGURE 13-5
When you choose a 
customer or job in the 
Received From box, the 
Customer Balance at the 
window’s top right shows 
the corresponding balance, 
and QuickBooks fills in the 
table with every unpaid 
invoice for that customer 
or job. If you choose a 
customer (as shown here), 
QuickBooks adds the Job 
column to the table and 
fills in the rows with the 
customer’s outstanding 
invoices. The cell in the 
Job column lists the job’s 
name when an invoice ap-
plies to a specific job, and 
it’s blank when the invoice 
applies to the customer.
 TIP 	 You don’t have to fill in the Payment Amount box if you’ve turned on the “Automatically calculate pay­
ments” preference (page 657). With this setting turned on, QuickBooks fills in the payment transaction’s Payment 
Amount field with the value of the first invoice you select. As you select (or deselect) additional invoices, the 
program recalculates the total payment.
If this preference is turned off, you have to fill in the Payment Amount field with the payment amount in order 
to select invoices in the table. If you leave the Payment Amount field blank and try to select an invoice in the 
table, QuickBooks warns you that you can’t apply an amount greater than the total payment plus any credits the 
customer has. The advantage to turning this preference off is that a discrepancy between the customer’s payment 
and the selected invoice total is easy to spot—the Underpayment or Overpayment section shown in Figure 13-6 
appears, showing the difference between the two values.
4.	 If you turned off the “Automatically apply payments” preference (page 657), 
in the window’s table, turn on the checkmark cells (in the first column) for the 
invoices to which you want to apply the payment, as shown in Figure 13-6.
To tell QuickBooks to choose the invoices for you, on the window’s Main tab, 
click Auto Apply Payment. (Once you’ve selected at least one invoice to pay, this 
button’s label changes to Un-Apply Payment.) The box on page 350 explains how 
to adjust the amount of the payment that’s applied to the invoices you select.

If the “Automatically apply payments” preference is turned on, after you enter 
the payment amount and either press Tab or click another box, QuickBooks 
automatically selects an invoice for you. If the payment doesn’t match any of 
the customer’s invoice amounts, QuickBooks applies the payment to the oldest 
invoices first. If the program doesn’t select the correct invoices, turn off the 
checkmark cells that QuickBooks turned on, and then turn on the checkmark 
cells for the invoices you want. (If QuickBooks selects the wrong invoices but 
you don’t notice until later, see page 356 to find out how to correct this mistake 
after you’ve applied the payment.)
FIGURE 13-6
Sometimes, the amount 
your customer sends 
doesn’t match any combi-
nation of open invoices. 
If that’s the case, first see 
if the customer deducted 
an available credit (page 
350) or early payment 
discount (page 353). 
Otherwise, you can edit 
the values in the Payment 
column to allocate the 
payment to those invoices. 
(The total has to match the 
total payment.)
 TIP 	 When you select a customer who is set up to use a foreign currency, the Receive Payments window’s 
“Exchange Rate 1 [currency] =” box comes to life, filled in with the current exchange rate set in QuickBooks. If 
you want to use a different rate, type it in this box. If the exchange rate you use when you receive the payment 
is different from the rate you used on the invoice, QuickBooks automatically calculates the gain or loss (page 461) 
for the transaction.

5.	 To the right of the Payment Amount box, click the icon that corresponds to 
the method the customer used to make the payment.
If you click Cash, QuickBooks displays the Reference # box, where you can type 
a receipt number or other identifier. If you click Check, QuickBooks displays the 
Check # box instead, so you can type the number from the customer’s check. 
For any type of credit card or EFT, in the Card No. box and Exp. Date boxes, 
type the card’s number and the month and year that it expires. The Reference 
# box that appears is perfect for storing the credit card transaction number.
6.	 If the Deposit To box is visible, choose the account for the deposit, such 
as your checking account, money market account, or Undeposited Funds 
account.
When you first start using QuickBooks, the program’s Use Undeposited Funds 
preference (page 657) is turned on, which tells QuickBooks to automatically 
deposit payments into your Undeposited Funds account. When this setting is 
on, you won’t see the Deposit To box, and the program holds payments in that 
account until you tell it to deposit those payments into a specific bank account.
If electronic payments land directly in your bank account (for example, pay­
ments made with PayPal or a merchant credit card service), you can record those 
deposits to the appropriate bank account in the Receive Payments window. To 
do that, turn the Use Undeposited Funds preference off and then, in the Receive 
Payments window, choose the bank account in the Deposit To box.
 TIP 	 To make reconciling your bank statement a bit easier, choose the Deposit To account based on the way 
your bank statement shows deposits you make. For example, if your bank statement shows only a deposit total 
regardless of how many checks were in the deposit, put payments in the Undeposited Funds account. If your 
bank shows every check you deposit, choose your QuickBooks bank account instead so that each payment ap­
pears separately. (Page 657 explains how to set your QuickBooks preferences so that the program always chooses 
Undeposited Funds for payments.)
If the customer paid too much or too little (or you’ve selected too few or too 
many open invoices in the Receive Payments window), you’ll see an overpay­
ment or underpayment message like the one in the lower-left part of Figure 
13-6. Before you edit values in the Payment column, make sure that you’ve 
selected the correct invoices. Then see if the Available Credits value equals 
the Underpayment value. If it does, your customer reduced the payment by its 
available credit. See page 350 for details about applying credits.
7.	 If you want to print a payment receipt, at the top of the Receive Payments 
window, click Print→Payment.
QuickBooks opens the Print Lists dialog box. If necessary, change the print 
settings, and then click Print.

UP TO SPEED
Different Ways to Apply Payments
Most of the time, customers send payments that bear a clear 
relationship to their unpaid invoices. For those payments, 
QuickBooks’ preference that automatically selects invoices 
(page 657) is a real timesaver: You type the payment amount 
in the Receive Payments window’s Payment Amount box, and 
the program selects the most likely invoice(s) for payment. 
When a payment matches an invoice amount exactly, this 
feature works perfectly almost every time.
But every once in a while you’ll receive a payment that doesn’t 
match up, and you’ll have to tell QuickBooks how to apply the 
payment. For example, if the payment and the customer’s 
available credit (taken together) match an open invoice, you 
can use the method explained on page 350 to apply them 
to the invoice. (If you have no idea what the customer had 
in mind, don’t guess—contact the customer and ask how to 
apply the payment.)
Regardless of the situation, you can adjust the values in the 
Receive Payments window’s Payment column to match your 
customer’s wishes. Here’s how to handle some common 
scenarios:
• Customer includes the invoice number on the payment. 
If QuickBooks selects an invoice other than the one the 
customer specifies, click the selected invoice’s checkmark 
cell to turn it off. Then turn on the checkmark for the 
desired invoice to make QuickBooks apply the payment to 
it and type the amount of the payment in the Payment cell.
• Payment is less than any outstanding invoices. In this case, 
QuickBooks applies the payment to the oldest invoice. 
Simply click Save & Close to apply the payment as is. 
Your customers will thank you for helping them avoid 
(or reduce) your finance charges.
• Payment is greater than the total of the customer’s 
invoices. If the payment is larger than all the customer’s 
unpaid invoices, apply the payment to all its open invoices 
and adjust the Payment cells if necessary. Then create 
a credit or write a refund check for the amount of the 
overpayment (page 288).
Applying Credits to Invoices When You 
Receive Payments
When something goes awry with the services or products you sell, customers won’t 
be bashful about asking for a refund or credit. And customers who buy from you 
regularly might prefer a credit against their next order rather than a refund so that 
checks aren’t flying back and forth in the mail (page 288 tells you how to create a 
credit). 
As you saw on page 291, you can apply a credit to a customer’s invoice at any time 
to reduce the amount that the customer owes. But if a credit is still available when 
you receive a customer’s payment, you can apply the credit and the payment at the 
same time. Here’s what you do:

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
351
APPLYING 
CREDITS TO 
INVOICES WHEN 
YOU RECEIVE 
PAYMENTS
1.	 Choose Customers→Receive Payments or, on the Home Page, click Receive 
Payments.
QuickBooks opens the Receive Payments window.
2.	 In the Received From drop-down list, choose the customer or job you 
want. In the Payment Amount box, type the customer’s payment amount, 
and to the right of this box, click the button for the payment method the 
customer used.
If you choose a customer or job with an available credit, the Available Credits 
section appears below the window’s table and shows the amount of credit that’s 
available (this section is visible in Figure 13-6). If you choose a customer, the 
Available Credits value represents all the credits available for all jobs for that 
customer. If your customer reduced the payment by the amount of its available 
credit, you’ll also see the Underpayment section at the window’s bottom left.
3.	 To apply the credit to the invoice you selected, at the top of the Receive 
Payments window, click Discounts And Credits.
QuickBooks opens the “Discount and Credits” dialog box (Figure 13-7).
FIGURE 13-7
When you click a credit’s checkmark 
cell in the Available Credits table 
here, the Credits Used value changes 
to show the total credit that has 
been applied to the invoice, and the 
Balance Due value shows how much is 
still due on the invoice (if any). 
If you applied other credits to the 
invoice in the past, they appear in the 
Previously Applied Credits table at the 
bottom of this dialog box.

4.	 If necessary, in the Available Credits table, click the credit’s checkmark 
cell to turn it on.
If the customer asked you not to apply a credit, turn off that credit’s checkmark 
cell. If the credit doesn’t appear in the “Discount and Credits” dialog box, it 
probably relates to a different job or to the customer only. If you want to apply 
a credit to a different job or to the customer’s account, see the box on page 350.
5.	 Click Done.
QuickBooks closes the “Discount and Credits” dialog box and returns to the 
Receive Payments window, where you see the applied credit, as shown in 
Figure 13-8.
FIGURE 13-8
When you apply a credit 
to an invoice, its amount 
appears in the Credits cell 
in the Receive Payments 
window’s table and to the 
right of the “Discounts 
and Credits Applied” label 
below the table. 
When you’ve applied all 
a customer’s credits, the 
Available Credits value 
equals 0.00.
6.	 Click Save & Close to apply the credit to the invoice.
If the customer’s available credit is greater than the total for an invoice, you 
can still apply the credit to that invoice. QuickBooks reduces the invoice’s bal­
ance to zero but keeps the remainder of the credit available so you can apply 
it to another invoice. Simply repeat these steps to apply the leftover credit to 
another invoice.
Discounting for Early Payment
Customers aren’t eligible for early payment discounts until they actually pay early, 
so it makes sense that you apply such discounts in the Receive Payments window. 
The process for applying an early payment discount is almost identical to applying a 
credit. In fact, if an invoice qualifies for both a credit and an early payment discount, 
you can apply them both in the “Discount and Credits” dialog box.

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
353
DISCOUNTING 
FOR EARLY 
PAYMENT
 NOTE 	 If the discount is for something other than an early payment, such as a product that’s on sale, instead 
of using the technique described in this section, add a Discount item to the invoice when you create it (page 241).
Here’s how to apply an early payment discount to a customer:
1.	 On the Home Page, click Receive Payments or choose Customers→Receive 
Payments.
2.	 In the Receive Payments window’s Received From drop-down list, choose 
the customer or job for the payment you received.
The window’s table then displays all the invoices and/or statements for that 
customer or job that aren’t paid.
3.	 In the Payment Amount box, type the payment amount you received from 
the customer.
If the “Automatically apply payments” preference is turned on (page 657), when 
you click away from this box, QuickBooks applies the payment to the customer 
or job’s open invoices. If QuickBooks doesn’t apply the payment to the correct 
invoices, you can choose the ones you want (page 350). If that preference is 
turned off, turn on the checkmark cells (in the first column) for the invoices to 
which you want to apply the payment
If the customer already deducted the early payment discount, the Receive Pay­
ments window shows an underpayment (Figure 13-9).
4.	 To apply the early payment discount, at the top of the Receive Payments 
window, click Discounts And Credits.
QuickBooks opens the “Discount and Credits” dialog box. If the Credits tab 
is visible, click the Discount tab to display the Discount fields shown in Figure 
13-10. If the date of the payment is earlier than the Discount Date that’s listed, 
QuickBooks uses the early payment percentage from the customer’s payment 
terms (page 76) to calculate the Suggested Discount. For example, if the cus­
tomer gets a 2 percent discount for paying early, the suggested discount is 2 
percent of the invoice total.
 NOTE 	 Customers often deduct their early payment discounts despite sending their payments after the 
early payment cutoff date. The typical reaction of most business owners is a resigned sigh. Although QuickBooks 
shows the suggested discount as zero when a customer doesn’t actually pay early, you can show your customer 
goodwill and accept his payment. In the Amount of Discount box, simply type the discount that the customer 
took.

FIGURE 13-9
If the customer sent a 
payment that’s less than 
the invoice amount, you’ll 
see the difference as an 
underpayment, as shown 
here. 
Look below the unpaid in-
voice table for a message 
that says the customer 
has discounts or credits 
available, as unapplied 
discounts and credits 
might explain the differ-
ence between the pay-
ment and invoice amounts. 
If you see that message, 
click the Discounts And 
Credits button at the top of 
the window to apply the 
available discounts and 
credits.
5.	 In the Discount Account box, choose the income account you’ve set up to 
track customer discounts.
You might think it makes sense to post customer discounts to one of your income 
accounts for products or services you sell. But customer discounts tend to fall off 
your radar when they’re buried among your regular income. The best course of 
action is to keep track of the discounts you give by creating an income account 
specifically for them, called something imaginative like Customer Discounts.
If you spot an expense account called Discounts, don’t use that as your customer 
discount account, either. An expense account for discounts is meant to track 
the discounts you receive from your vendors.
6.	 If you use classes, in the Discount Class box, choose the appropriate one.
This class is typically the same one you used for the invoice.

FIGURE 13-10
QuickBooks automatically puts the 
suggested discount in the Amount 
of Discount box, but you can type a 
different amount—if the customer 
paid only part of the invoice early, for 
instance. 
The Invoice section at the top of the 
dialog box shows the amount due on 
the invoice and the balance due after 
applying the early payment discount 
you chose. If the customer has already 
paid the invoice in full, the early 
payment discount becomes a credit 
for the next invoice.
7.	 Click Done.
When QuickBooks closes the “Discount and Credits” dialog box and returns to 
the Receive Payments window, you’ll see the discount in two or three places, 
as Figure 13-11 shows. The early payment discount appears both in the invoice 
table’s Discount column and below the table next to the “Discount and Credits 
Applied” label. If the customer paid the invoice in full, the early payment discount 
also becomes an overpayment (not shown in Figure 13-11).
 TIP 	 If a customer overpays, QuickBooks displays two options at the bottom left of the Receive Payments 
window: “Leave the credit to be used later” and “Refund the amount to the customer.” Unless your customer 
wants a refund, keep “Leave the credit to be used later” selected.
8.	 When you’re done, click Save & Close.
You’ve just recorded the payment with the discount applied.

Correcting Misapplied Customer Payments
Say you realize that you’ve applied a payment to the wrong invoice. The way you 
correct this mistake depends on whether you applied the payment to a different 
invoice for the same customer or job, or you applied it to the wrong customer or job. 
This section shows you how to fix misapplied payments in both situations (regardless 
of whether you’ve deposited the payments).
Wrong Invoice, Right Customer or Job
If you simply selected the wrong invoice for a customer or job when you applied a 
payment, it’s easy to set things straight. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Customers→Customer Center or, on the Home Page, click Custom­
ers. On the Customer Center’s Customers & Jobs tab, click the customer or 
job whose payment you misapplied.
The Transactions tab in the Customer Center’s lower right displays the transac­
tions for the customer or job you selected.
2.	 On the Transactions tab, click the Show box’s down arrow, and then choose 
Received Payments.
If you do that but still don’t see the payment you’re looking for, click the Filter 
By down arrow and choose All Payment Methods; or click the Date down arrow 
and choose a different date range.
3.	 When you see the payment in question, double-click it.
The Receive Payments window opens to the payment you double-clicked.

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable

CORRECTING 
MISAPPLIED 
CUSTOMER

4.	 In the Receive Payments window’s unpaid invoice table, you’ll see both the 
wrong invoice and the right one. Turn off the checkmark cell for the cur­
rently selected invoice; turn on the checkmark cell for the correct invoice, 
and then click Save & Close.
QuickBooks applies the payment to the correct invoice.
Wrong Invoice, Wrong Customer
When you apply a payment to the wrong customer’s invoice, you can’t use the steps 
in the previous section. Here’s why: When you open the misapplied payment in the 
Receive Payments window, the Received From box contains the erroneous customer 
or job, and the invoices that appear in the window’s unpaid invoices table are for that 
customer. That means there’s no way to select the invoice for the correct customer 
in the Receive Payments window.
To correct this type of misapplied payment, you need to create a new payment for 
the correct customer and delete the payment you applied to the wrong customer. 
The good news is that this approach also works if you deposited a payment without 
applying it to an invoice; it even works if you’ve already reconciled the deposit with 
your bank account. Here are the steps:
1.	 First, create a new payment for the correct customer.
To do this, in the Customer Center (Customers→Customer Center), click 
the Customers & Jobs tab, and then select the customer or job to which 
the payment should be applied. Then, at the top of the window, click New 
Transactions→Receive Payments and follow the steps on page 346 to record 
the new payment. Click Save & Close when you’re done.
2.	 If you already deposited the misapplied payment, on the Home Page, click 
Record Deposits (or choose Banking→Make Deposits). If you haven’t de­
posited the payment, skip to step 7.
If you see the “Payments to Deposit” window, click OK to open the Make De­
posits window.
3.	 In the Make Deposits window’s toolbar, click Previous until you see the 
deposit you’re looking for.
If you don’t see the deposit, be sure to choose the correct bank account in the 
window’s Deposit To box.
4.	 In the window’s toolbar, click Payments. In the “Payments to Deposit” 
window, click the checkmark cell for the payment you created in step 1, 
and then click OK.
The Make Deposits window’s table now lists both the old payment and the new 
payment, as shown in Figure 13-12.

click Received Payments. Double-click the payment you misapplied to open it 
in the Receive Payments window. At the top of the Receive Payments window, 
click Delete, and then, in the message box, click OK.
Because you deleted the original payment, it’s a good idea to document what you 
did. For example, add a note (page 481) to the customer or job to which the deleted 
payment belonged explaining why you deleted it.

APPLYING 
FINANCE 
CHARGES
Applying Finance Charges
If you’ve tried everything but some customers still won’t pay, you can resort to 
finance charges. These charges usually don’t cover the cost of keeping after the 
slackers, but QuickBooks at least minimizes the time you spend on this vexing task.
 NOTE 	 Typically, only small businesses actually pay finance charges. Corporations usually ignore them, so 
you may decide to skip finance charges for your corporate clients (you’ll just have to reverse the charges later 
on).
Customers tend to get cranky if you spring finance charges on them without warn­
ing, so spend some time up front determining your payment policies: what interest 
rate you’ll charge, what constitutes “late,” and so on. Include these terms in the 
contracts your customers sign and on the sales forms you send. Then, after you 
configure QuickBooks with your finance-charge settings, a few clicks is all it’ll take 
to add those penalties to customer accounts.
Finance Charge Preferences
Before you apply finance charges, you need to tell QuickBooks how steep your fi­
nance charges are, when they kick in, and a few other details. To adjust these settings, 
choose Edit→Preferences→Finance Charge. Because your finance-charge policies 
should apply to all your customers, these settings are on the Company Preferences 
tab, which means only a QuickBooks administrator can change them. To learn how 
to set these preferences, see page 646.
Assessing Finance Charges on Overdue Balances
QuickBooks creates finance-charge invoices for customers tardy enough to war­
rant late fees, but you don’t have to print or send these invoices. Instead, you can 
assess finance charges just before you print customer statements (page 305) to 
have QuickBooks include the finance-charge invoices on statements, along with any 
outstanding invoices and unpaid charges for the customer.
 TIP 	 Make sure you apply payments and credits to invoices before you assess finance charges. Otherwise, 
you’ll spend most of your time reversing finance charges and working to get back into your customers’ good 
graces.
Here’s how to assess finance charges for slow-paying customers:
1.	 Choose Customers→Assess Finance Charges or, on the Home Page, click 
the Finance Charges icon.
The Assess Finance Charges window (Figure 13-13) opens.
If your company file is set up to use multiple currencies, in the A/R Account 
box, select the account for the currency you want to work with.

if you see any asterisks, 
click Cancel. After you’ve 
applied those payments 
(page 346) and credits

to start back at step 1. 
QuickBooks automatically 
chooses the current date 
as the date on which you 
want to assess finance 
charges and selects all the 
customers with overdue 
balances.
2.	 If you begin the process of preparing statements a few days before the end 
of the month, in the Assessment Date box, change the date to the last day 
of the month.
The last day of the month is a popular cutoff date for customer statements. 
When you change the date in the Assessment Date box and then move to an­
other field, QuickBooks recalculates the finance charges to reflect the charges 
through that new date.
3.	 If you don’t want to assess finance charges on one of the customers in the 
list, in the window’s table, click that customer’s Assess cell to turn off the 
checkmark.
QuickBooks automatically selects all customers with overdue balances, but 
you can let some of them slide without penalty. Since there’s no way to flag a 
customer as exempt from finance charges, you have to do this manually. If you 
reserve finance charges for your most intractable customers, click Unmark All 
to turn off all the finance charges. Then, in the Assess column, click only the 
cells for the customers you want to penalize.

CASH SALES
To view a customer’s invoices, payments, and credits, click the row for that 
customer, and then click Collection History. QuickBooks displays a Collections 
Report for that customer that shows every open transaction that’s past due.
4.	 If you want to change a finance charge amount, click it in the Finance Charge 
column, and then type the new amount.
The only time you might want to do this is when you’ve created a credit memo 
(page 288) for a customer but you don’t want to apply it to an invoice. As long 
as the credit memo is out there, it’s simpler to forgo the finance charges until 
you’ve applied the credit.
5.	 If you want to print and send the finance-charge invoices, turn on the “Mark 
Invoices ‘To be printed’” checkbox.
If you plan to send customer statements, leave this checkbox turned off. Send­
ing customers statements to remind them of overdue balances is one thing, but 
sending a statement and a finance-charge invoice borders on nagging.
6.	 To finalize the finance-charge invoices for the selected customers, click the 
Assess Charges button.
If you turned on the “Mark Invoice ‘To be printed’” checkbox, QuickBooks adds 
the finance-charge invoices to the queue of invoices to be printed. When you 
print all the queued invoices (page 308), the program prints the finance-charge 
invoices as well.
Cash Sales
Receiving payment when you deliver a service or product is known as a cash sale, 
even though your customer might pay you with cash, check, or credit card. For 
example, if you run a thriving massage therapy business, your customers probably 
pay for their stress relief before they leave your office—and no matter how they pay, 
QuickBooks considers the transaction a cash sale.
If your customers want records of their payments, you give them sales receipts. In 
QuickBooks, a sales receipt can do double-duty: It records the cash sale in the pro­
gram, and you can print it as a paper receipt for your customer. (The box on page 
363 explains how to record payments you receive through PayPal using QuickBooks 
sales receipts.)
 NOTE 	 Although a cash sale is a simultaneous exchange of money for goods (or services), you don’t actually 
have to create a QuickBooks sales receipt at the time of the sale.
Here are the two most common ways of handling cash sales:
• Recording individual sales. If you want to keep track of which customers 
purchase which products, create a separate sales receipt for each cash sale. 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
362
CASH SALES
Individual sales receipts track both customers’ purchases and the state of your 
inventory.
 NOTE 	 If you keep QuickBooks open on the computer in your store, you can print individual sales receipts 
for your customers. But keeping QuickBooks running on the store computer could be risky if the wrong people 
start snooping around in your records. And, unless you’re completely proficient with the program’s sales receipts, 
you might find that hand-writing paper sales receipts is faster when your store is swamped. Then, when there’s 
a lull, you can enter individual receipts into your QuickBooks company file.
• Recording batch sales. If your shop gets lots of one-time customers, you don’t 
care about tracking who purchases your products, but you still need to know 
how much inventory you have and how much money you’ve made. In this situ­
ation, you don’t have to create a separate sales receipt for each sale. Instead, 
create one for each business day, which shows how much money you brought 
in that day and what you sold.
Creating Sales Receipts
Creating sales receipts in QuickBooks is like creating invoices, except for a few small 
differences. Here’s what you do:
1.	 Choose Customers→Enter Sales Receipts or, on the Home Page, click Cre­
ate Sales Receipts.
 NOTE 	 You see the Create Sales Receipt icon only if you’ve turned on the sales receipt preference (page 697).
The Enter Sales Receipts window opens.
2.	 Click the icon for the method of payment, such as Cash, Check, or Credit 
Debit. If the customer paid with a check, fill in the Check No. box with the 
customer’s check number. 
For cash or credit cards, leave the Check No. box blank.
3.	 Fill in the item table with the items your customer purchased.
4.	 If you see the Deposit To box, choose an account to tell QuickBooks where 
to plop the money you made from the sale.
The Deposit To box appears only if you’ve turned off the preference to use the 
Undeposited Funds account (page 657).
5.	 If you want to print the sales receipt now, at the top of the window, click 
Print→Sales Receipt to have QuickBooks open the Print One Sales Receipt 
dialog box.
To learn more about your printing options, see page 308.

6.	 Click Save & Close to save the sales receipt.
The Enter Sales Receipts window closes. If you want to record another sales 
receipt, click Save & New instead to start a new transaction. Click Revert to clear 
the info you filled in so you can start over.
 WARNING 	 Keeping track of customers who make one-time cash purchases can clog your Customer:Job 
List with unnecessary information. To keep your Customer:Job List lean, create a customer called Cash Sales 
(page 70).
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Receiving PayPal Payments
If you accept payments via PayPal, those payments are almost 
like cash sales in that they show up in your PayPal account im-
mediately. However, PayPal takes its cut from the money you 
receive. In QuickBooks, you can create a sales receipt to record 
a PayPal payment and its fees. But before you can do that, you 
have to do a bit of setup. Here are the steps:
1.	 In QuickBooks, create a bank account (page 56) that 
represents your PayPal account. Your PayPal account 
is similar to a regular bank account because you can 
deposit payments into it, pay bills with the money in it, 
and withdraw money from it.
2.	 If you don’t already have a QuickBooks item for merchant 
account fees, create an Other Charge item (page 113) for 
your PayPal fees. In the New Item window’s Account 
box, choose an expense account for merchant account 
or bank fees.
3.	 For each payment you receive, create a sales receipt (page 
362). In the Enter Sales Receipts window, fill in the boxes 
as you would for a cash sale, including the items that the 
customer purchased.
4.	 In the next blank line in the Enter Sales Receipts window’s 
item table, add the PayPal fee item you created in 
step 2. Fill in the Amount cell with the PayPal fee as a 
negative number, to reduce the net amount you receive. 
5.	 In the Deposit To box above the sales receipt, choose the 
bank account you set up for PayPal. By doing this, the 
payment is deposited directly in your QuickBooks PayPal 
account, just like it is in your real-world PayPal account. 
(If you don’t see the Deposit To box, you can record the 
deposit after you save the sales receipt in the Make 
Deposits window [page 368].)
6.	 Click Save & Close. The payment increases the balance in 
your QuickBooks PayPal account and in your real-world 
PayPal account.
Unless you buy as much as you sell on PayPal, at some point 
you’ll want to transfer money from your PayPal account to 
your regular bank account. To do this, record a transfer in 
QuickBooks (page 386), and then hop online, log into your 
PayPal account, withdraw money from PayPal, and move it 
to your bank account.
If you sell oodles of stuff via PayPal, recording sales receipts in 
QuickBooks for each transaction grows old quickly. You can short-
cut your data entry with a third-party tool that imports PayPal 
transactions. One of the most popular products is SimplePort 
(www.simpleport.net). Other programs include WebGility (www.
webgility.com) and T-HUB (www.atandra.com).
Editing Sales Receipts
If you’re in the process of creating a sales receipt, you can jump to any field and 
change its value. You can also insert or delete lines (page 239) in the sales receipt’s 
line-item table as your customer tosses another book on the pile or puts one back 
on the shelf.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
364
CASH SALES
Although you can edit sales receipts after you’ve saved them, you won’t do so 
very often. After all, the sale is complete, and your customer has left with her copy 
of the receipt. However, you may want to edit the sales receipt after the sale to 
add more detailed descriptions to items, for example. To do so, in the Enter Sales 
Receipts window, click the left arrow (Previous) or right arrow (Next) until you see 
the receipt you want (or click Find, which is described on page 332), and then add 
the additional info.
Voiding and Deleting Sales Receipts
If you created a sales receipt by mistake and want to remove its values from your 
accounts, you might think about simply deleting the receipt. However, you should 
always void sales receipts that you don’t want rather than deleting them.
If you delete a sales receipt, it’s gone for good: QuickBooks removes the dollar 
values and any sign of the transaction from your accounts. You’ll see a hole in your 
numbering sequence of sales receipts and an entry in the audit trail that says you 
deleted the transaction (page 437). Voiding a sales receipt, on the other hand, resets 
the dollar values for the transaction to zero (so your account balances show no sign 
of the transaction) and marks the transaction as void, so you have a record of it.
Here’s how to void a sales receipt:
1.	 On the Home Page, click Create Sales Receipts (or choose Customers→Enter 
Sales Receipts).
The Enter Sales Receipts window opens.
2.	 Click the left or right arrow until you see the receipt in question, and then 
right-click the Sales Receipt window and choose Void Sales Receipt on the 
shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 13-14.
All the values in the form change to zero, and QuickBooks adds “VOID:” to the 
Memo field. To remind yourself why you voided that transaction, type a reason 
after the colon.
3.	 Click Save & Close.
Memorizing a Batch Sales Transaction
If you want to reduce your paperwork by recording one batch sales receipt for each 
business day’s sales, why not go one step further and memorize a batch sales receipt 
that you can reuse every day? Here’s how:
1.	 On the Home Page, click Create Sales Receipts or choose Customers→Enter 
Sales Receipts.
QuickBooks opens the Enter Sales Receipts window.

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
365
CASH SALES
FIGURE 13-14
Shortcut menus like this 
make choosing features 
easier. 
Simply right-click 
anywhere in the Enter 
Sales Receipts window to 
display the shortcut menu 
shown here.
2.	 In the Customer:Job box, choose the generic customer you created for 
cash sales.
If you haven’t set up a cash sale customer yet, in the Customer:Job box, choose 
<Add New>. In the New Customer dialog box’s Customer Name box, type a name 
like Cash Sales. Then click OK to save the customer and use it for the sales receipt.
3.	 If you typically sell the same types of items every day, in the table’s Item 
cells, choose those items.
Leave the Qty cells blank because those values are almost guaranteed to 
change each day.
4.	 If you want to split your daily sales among different types of payments (like 
Visa, MasterCard, and so on), add a Payment item for each type of credit 
card and other form of payment you accept, as shown in Figure 13-15.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
366
CASH SALES
Because sales receipts are meant to handle cash, the total at the bottom of the 
form represents the bank deposit you make at the end of the day. But it can 
be helpful to know exactly which forms of payments customers used that day. 
To set up the memorized sales receipt so you can record that info, in the Item 
table, choose a Payment item, like Payment-Visa. (When you create a Payment 
item [page 117], choose the “Group with other undeposited funds” option so 
you can control when you deposit the money.) Leave the Amount cell blank; 
you’ll fill in the actual amounts when you use the memorized sales receipt to 
record the sales for a particular day.
FIGURE 13-15
Add a Payment item for 
every form of payment 
you accept (American 
Express, Discover, debit 
cards, checks, and so on). 
Then, when you use the 
memorized transaction to 
record batch sales receipts, 
type a negative number 
for the amount charged 
to each type of payment. 
If the Total value doesn’t 
match the amount of 
your cash deposit, add an 
item for excess or short 
cash to make your bank 
deposit balance. (The next 
section explains how to 
use excess- and short-cash 
items.)
 TIP 	 By splitting a sales receipt among different types of payments, you can make a single deposit to each 
merchant card account at the end of the day. To do so, choose Banking→Make Deposits. In the “Payments to 
Deposit” window, choose the payment type in the “View payment method type” drop-down list. Select the deposits 
for that card, and then click OK to deposit them to the bank or merchant card company. Repeat this process for 
each type of payment you accept. (This technique works as long as your merchant card company deducts its fees 
as a single amount, instead of as a fee on every charge transaction.)
5.	 When the sales receipt is set up the way you want, press Ctrl+M to open the 
Memorize Transaction dialog box.
In the Name box, type a name for the reusable sales receipt, such as Day’s 
Cash Sales.

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
367
CASH SALES
6.	 If you want to use this memorized sales receipt only on the days you have 
cash sales, choose the Do Not Remind Me option.
If you receive cash sales every day, choose the Remind Me option and then, in 
the How Often box, choose Daily.
7.	 To memorize the sales receipt, click OK.
QuickBooks closes the Memorize Transaction dialog box and adds the batch 
sales receipt to the Memorized Transaction List.
8.	 If you created the sales receipt simply to memorize it, click Clear, and then 
close the Enter Sales Receipts window.
To use the sales receipt, fill in the values in the table, and then click Save & Close.
Now that you’ve memorized the batch sales receipt, you can create a new sales 
receipt for a given day by pressing Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transaction List 
window. There, double-click the memorized transaction for your batch sales receipt. 
QuickBooks opens the Enter Sales Receipts window to a new sales receipt based on 
the one you memorized. Edit the items in the window’s table, their quantities, and 
the prices to reflect your day’s sales, and then click Save & Close.
Reconciling Excess and Short Cash
When you take in paper money and make change, you’re bound to make small mis­
takes. Unless you’re lucky enough to have one of those automatic change machines, 
the money in the cash register at the end of the day rarely matches the sales you 
record. Over time, the amounts you’re short or over tend to balance out, but that’s 
no help when you have to record sales in QuickBooks that don’t match your bank 
deposits.
The solution to this reality of cash sales is one final sales receipt at the end of the 
day that reconciles your cash register’s total with your bank deposit slip. But be­
fore you can create this reconciliation receipt, you need to create an account and 
a couple of items:
• Over/Under account. To keep track of your running total for excess and short 
cash, create an Income account named something like Over/Under. If you use 
account numbers, give this account a number that makes it appear near the 
end of your Income accounts. For example, if Uncategorized Income is account 
number 4999, make the Over/Under account 4998.
• Over item. Create an Other Charge item to track the excess cash you collect, 
and assign it to the Over/Under account. Make sure that you set up this item 
as nontaxable.
• Under item. Create a second Other Charge item to track the amounts that 
you’re short and assign it to the Over/Under account. This item should also be 
nontaxable.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
368
MAKING 
DEPOSITS
At the end of each day, compare the income you recorded (run a Profit & Loss report 
and set the Date box to Today) with the amount of money in your cash register. Then 
create a sales receipt to make up the difference. Here’s how:
• If you have less cash than you should, create a sales receipt and, in the first 
Item cell, add the Under item. In the Amount cell, type the amount that you’re 
short as a negative number. When you save this receipt, QuickBooks adjusts 
your income for the day in your income accounts to match the money in the 
cash register.
• If you have too much cash, create a sales receipt and, in the first Item cell, 
add the Over item. In the Amount cell, type the excess amount as a positive 
number. This receipt increases your recorded income to match the money you 
have on hand.
 NOTE 	 If you notice that your cash count at the end of the day is always short, a fluke of probability could 
be at work. But it’s more likely that someone is helping herself to the cash in your till.
Making Deposits
Whether customers mail you checks or hand over wads of cash, taking those deposits 
to the bank isn’t enough—you also have to record them in QuickBooks. In the Receive 
Payments window, if you designate a bank account as the Deposit To account (page 
349), there’s nothing more to do after you save the payment—QuickBooks records 
the payment as a deposit to that account. However, if you initially store payments 
in the Undeposited Funds account, you have to work your way through two dialog 
boxes: one to record payments you receive, and then one to record the deposits you 
make in your bank account. (The box on page 369 explains how QuickBooks moves 
money between accounts as you record these transactions.) This section explains 
this two-step process. (The box on page 371 explains how to record deposits made 
with different payment types.)
Choosing Payments to Deposit
If you store payments in the Undeposited Funds account, you end up with a collec­
tion of payments ready for deposit that coincide with the paper checks or cash you 
have to take to the bank (or the credit card payments and electronic funds transfers 
that show up in your bank account without any action on your part). When you 
have payments queued up for deposit and choose Banking→Make Deposits (or, 
in the Home Page’s Banking panel, click Record Deposits), QuickBooks opens the 
“Payments to Deposit” window, where you can choose the payments you want to 
deposit in several ways, as Figure 13-16 shows.
 NOTE 	 If you have other checks to deposit, such as an insurance claim check, you’ll have a chance to add 
those to your deposit in the Make Deposits window as explained in the next section.

Following the Money Trail
If you use QuickBooks’ windows to create transactions, the 
program posts debits and credits to accounts without any ac-
tion on your part. But in case you’re interested in how money 
weaves its way from account to account, here’s what happens 
from the time you create an invoice to the time you deposit 
the customer’s payment into your bank account.
• Create Invoices. When you create an invoice, QuickBooks 
credits (increases) your income accounts because you’ve 
earned income and debits (increases) your Accounts 
Receivable account because the customer owes you 
money.
• Receive Payments. When you receive payments into 
the Undeposited Funds account, QuickBooks credits 
(decreases) the Accounts Receivable account because 
the customer’s balance is now paid off. The program also 
debits (increases) the Undeposited Funds account because 
the money is now in that account waiting to be deposited.
• Make Deposits. When you deposit the payments queued 
in the Undeposited Funds account, QuickBooks credits 
(decreases) the Undeposited Funds account to remove the 
money from it and debits (increases) your bank account 
by the amount of the deposit.
FIGURE 13-16
To filter payments by 
method, choose one in the 
“View payment method 
type” box; QuickBooks 
then displays only pay-
ments of that type. 
To record deposits for pay-
ments made in a foreign 
currency, in the “View 
Payments for currency” 
drop-down list (which 
you see only if you have 
multiple currencies turned 
on), choose the currency. 
You enter your bank’s 
exchange rate for the de-
posit in the Make Deposits 
window (as explained on 
page 370).
To choose specific payments to deposit, in the checkmark column, click each one 
you want to deposit. To select every payment listed, click Select All. When you’ve 
selected the payments you want, click OK. QuickBooks closes the “Payments to 
Deposit” window and opens the Make Deposits window, described next.

Recording Deposits
The Make Deposits window is like an electronic deposit slip, as you can see in Figure 
13-17. The payments you chose to deposit in the “Payments to Deposit” window are 
already filled in. If you have other checks to deposit besides customer payments, 
they don’t automatically show up in this window, but you can add them to the table.
 NOTE 	 If you’re depositing a payment made in a foreign currency, in the Make Deposit window’s “Exchange 
Rate 1 [currency] =” box, type the exchange rate that your bank used for the transaction (to find it, look at your 
bank statement or review the transaction on your bank’s website). The window’s table of deposits then shows 
the deposit amount in the foreign currency, and the bottom of the window shows the deposit total in both the 
foreign currency and your home currency.
After you make your foreign-currency deposits, you can see how much you gained or lost due to changes in the 
exchange rate by choosing Reports→Company & Financial→Realized Gains & Losses. This report shows the 
payment amounts in your home currency, the exchange rate, and the resulting gain or loss.
FIGURE 13-17
The Make Deposits window 
lets you specify the 
account into which you’re 
depositing funds, the 
date, and each payment 
in the deposit. If you’re in 
the habit of withdrawing 
some petty cash from your 
deposits, you can record 
that, too. 
To avoid bouncing checks, 
in the Date box, be sure to 
choose the date that you 
actually make the deposit.
Here’s how to add these additional deposits:
1.	 Click the first blank Received From cell and then choose the vendor or name 
of the source of your deposit. Then, in that row’s From Account cell, choose 
the account to which you’re posting the money. 
For example, if you’re depositing a refund check for some office supplies, choose 
the expense account for office supplies.

Chapter 13: Managing Accounts Receivable
371
MAKING 
DEPOSITS
2.	 In that same row’s Amount cell, fill in the amount of the additional deposit.
If you like, fill in the rest of the row’s cells. For refunds or checks from other 
sources, jotting a note in the Memo cell can help you remember why people 
sent you money. And entering the check number gives your customer or vendor 
a reference point in case a question arises.
 TIP 	 If you want to withdraw some money from your deposit for petty cash (page 215), in the “Cash back 
goes to” box, choose your petty cash account. (If you own a sole proprietorship, you can choose your owner’s 
draw account here instead.) Then, in the “Cash back amount” box, type the amount you’re deducting from the 
deposit.
3.	 Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional deposit you want to record.
4.	 When you’ve filled in all the fields you want, click Save & Close.
QuickBooks posts the deposits to your accounts.
UP TO SPEED
Putting Payment Deposit Types to Work
Choosing different types of payments before you get to the 
Make Deposits window takes extra work, but it’s a good idea 
for several reasons. Here are a few reasons you might make 
multiple passes through the deposit process:
• Different deposit types. Many banks group different types 
of deposits, such as checks versus electronic transfers. 
To group your payments in QuickBooks the way your 
bank groups them on your monthly statements, in the 
“Payments to Deposit” window’s “View payment method 
type” box, choose a method, and then click Select All to 
process those payments as a group.
• Different deposit accounts. If you deposit some payments 
in your checking account and others in a merchant account 
(or PayPal), in the “Payments to Deposit” window, select 
all the payments you want to deposit into the checking 
account and then, in the Make Deposits window, select 
that account in the Deposit To box. Then run through the 
deposit process a second time to deposit other payments 
to the next account.
• Reconciling cash deposits. As you learned earlier in this 
chapter, the cash-counting process is prone to error, 
so you’re probably used to your bank coming up with 
a different cash deposit total than you did. Although 
QuickBooks groups cash and checks as one payment type, 
process your cash and check payments as two separate 
deposits. That way, if the bank changes the deposit 
amount, it’s easy to edit your cash deposit.
Depositing Money from Merchant Card Accounts
When you accept payment via credit card, the merchant bank you work with collects 
your customers’ credit card payments and deposits them in your bank account as a 
lump sum. However, you record your deposits in QuickBooks the way they appear 
on your bank statement, which might or might not show lump sums. For example, 
your merchant bank might show payments and merchant bank fees separately, 
whereas the amount deposited in your checking account is the net amount after 
the merchant deducts its fees. 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
372
MAKING 
DEPOSITS
Here’s how to record deposits of merchant credit card payments and fees into your 
bank account to match the way they appear on your bank statement:
1.	 Choose Banking→Make Deposits or, on the Home Page, click Record De­
posits.
In the “Payments to Deposit” window’s “View payment method type” drop-
down list, choose the merchant card whose payments you want to deposit.
2.	 In the window’s table, select the credit card payments you want to deposit 
by turning on their checkmark cells, and then click OK.
QuickBooks opens the Make Deposits window, which lists the credit card pay­
ments in the deposit table. If the Deposit Subtotal amount doesn’t match the 
deposit that appears on your bank statement, the merchant bank probably 
deducted its fees; you’ll record those fees in the next step.
 TIP 	 To make merchant card deposits easier to track, ask your merchant card company to charge one lump 
sum for fees instead of charging for each transaction; it will almost certainly say yes.
3.	 In the Make Deposits window’s table, in the first blank row’s From Account 
cell, choose the account to which you post merchant card fees (such as Bank 
Service Charges). Then, in that row’s Amount cell, type the merchant card 
fees as a negative number.
The Deposit Subtotal amount should equal the deposit that appears on your 
bank statement.
4.	 When you’re done, click Save & Close.
 NOTE 	 How soon you can enter your merchant card deposits in QuickBooks depends on how wired your 
company is. If you use Bank Feeds (Chapter 24), QuickBooks automatically downloads merchant card deposits 
into your company file. If you have online access to your merchant card account, make the deposit in QuickBooks 
when you log into your merchant card account online and see the deposit in your transaction listing. If you don’t 
use any online services, enter the deposit in QuickBooks when the merchant card statement arrives in the mail.

CHAPTER
14
Y
ou’ve opened your mail, plucked out the customer payments, and deposited 
them in your bank account (Chapter 13). In addition to that, you’ve paid your 
bills (Chapter 9). Now you can sit back and relax knowing that most of the 
transactions in your bank and credit card accounts are accounted for. What’s left?
Some stray transactions might pop up—an insurance-claim check to deposit or han­
dling the aftermath and bank fees for a customer’s bounced check, to name a couple. 
Plus, running a business typically means that money moves between accounts—from 
interest-bearing accounts to checking accounts, from PayPal or merchant credit 
card accounts to your checking account, or from your regular checking account to 
a bank account specifically for payroll. For any financial transaction you perform, 
QuickBooks has a way to enter it, whether you prefer the guidance of transaction 
windows or the speed of an account-register window.
Reconciling your accounts to your bank statements is another key process you 
don’t want to skip. You and your bank can both make mistakes, and reconciling your 
accounts is the way to catch these discrepancies. Once the bane of bookkeepers 
everywhere, reconciling is practically automatic now that you can let QuickBooks 
handle the math.
In this chapter, the section on reconciling (page 389) is the only must-read. And if 
you want to learn the fastest way to enter any type of bank account transaction, 
don’t skip the first section (page 374). You can read about transferring funds, loans, 
bounced checks, and other financial arcana covered in this chapter as the need arises.

ENTERING

IN AN

REGISTER
Entering Transactions in an Account 
Register
QuickBooks includes windows and dialog boxes for making deposits, writing checks, 
and transferring funds, but you can also record these transactions right in a bank 
account’s register window. Working in a register window has two advantages over 
other windows and dialog boxes:
• Speed. Entering a transaction in a register window is fast, particularly when you 
use keyboard shortcuts (like pressing Tab to move between fields).
• Visibility. Transaction windows, such as Write Checks, keep you focused on the 
transaction at hand; but they take up lots of screen real estate, so it’s tough to 
see more than one of these windows at a time. But in a register window, you 
can look at previous transactions for reference.
Opening a Register Window
Obviously, you have to open a register window before you can enter transactions in 
it. Luckily, opening these windows couldn’t be easier. Here’s how to open any kind 
of account’s register window:
1.	 If the Chart of Accounts window isn’t open, press Ctrl+A (or, on the Home 
Page, click Chart of Accounts) to open it.
The window pops open, listing all the accounts in your chart of accounts.
 TIP 	 If you use the left icon bar, click View Balances in its middle section and then, in the View Balances 
section at the top of the icon bar, click the account you want. (If the account you want isn’t listed there, see page 
699 to learn how to add it.) If you use the top icon bar, you can open a bank account or credit card register by 
double-clicking the account you want to see in the Account Balances section on the right side of the Home Page.
2.	 In the Chart of Accounts window, double-click the account whose register 
window you want to open (Figure 14-1).
This method can open register windows for more than just bank accounts. See 
the box on page 378 to learn about different ways to handle credit card accounts.
 NOTE 	 Income and expense accounts don’t have registers in QuickBooks. So when you double-click an income 
or expense account in the Chart of Accounts window, QuickBooks generates a QuickReport of the transactions for 
that account. In the report window, you can take a closer look at a transaction by double-clicking it.
Creating a Transaction in an Account Register
The steps for creating a check in your checking account register (page 205) work 
for deposits and transfers, too, with only a few minor adjustments. Here’s how to fill 
in the cells in a register window to create any kind of bank transaction:

TRANSACTIONS

REGISTER
FIGURE 14-1
You can open a register 
window from the Chart 
of Accounts window by 
double-clicking any type 
of account that has a bal-
ance, including checking, 
savings, money market, 
and petty cash accounts. 
In fact, double-clicking 
opens the register for any 
account on your balance 
sheet (Accounts Receiv-
able, Accounts Payable, 
Credit Card, Asset, Liability, 
and Equity accounts).
• Date. When you first open a bank account’s register window, QuickBooks 
automatically selects the text in the Date field of the first blank transaction. 
Out of the box, QuickBooks puts the current date in the Date cell, but you can 
set a preference to have the program fill in the last date you used (page 650). 
Tweaking the date by a few days is as easy as pressing the + or – key on your 
keyboard until the date is the one you want. (To become a master of date-related 
keyboard shortcuts, read the box on page 377.)
• Number. For checks, when you jump to the Number cell (by pressing Tab), 
QuickBooks automatically fills in the next check number for that bank account. If 
the number doesn’t match the paper check you want to write, press + or – until 
the number is correct. (For some types of accounts, like credit cards and assets, 
the register window has a Ref field instead of a Number field. You can fill in a 
reference number for the transaction or leave this field blank.)
To make an online payment (see Chapter 24), in the Number cell, type S, which 
QuickBooks promptly changes to Send. (The program processes online pay­
ments only if you’ve set up an online payment service.) To enter a deposit, 
you can bypass the Number and Payment cells regardless of what values they 
contain, as shown in Figure 14-2.
• Payee. You don’t have to enter a value in this cell. In fact, if it’s a payee you only 
occasionally work with, it’s better to not type the vendor’s or other name in the 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

TRANSACTIONS

REGISTER
Payee cell for deposits, transfers, or petty cash transactions so your Vendors or 
Customers list doesn’t fill up with names you rarely use. Instead, type a generic 
name like Deposit or Petty Cash, and then fill in the Memo cell with a description 
of the transaction, like Insurance Claim.
For your regular payees, as you start typing the payee’s name, QuickBooks scans 
the names in the various lists in your company file (Vendors, Customer:Job, 
Other Names, and so on) and selects the first one it finds that matches the 
letters you’ve typed so far. As soon as QuickBooks selects the one you want, 
press Tab to move to the Payment cell.
FIGURE 14-2
You aren’t alone if you 
frequently type a deposit 
amount in the Payment 
cell by mistake. To record 
a deposit correctly, be 
sure to enter its value in 
the Deposit cell. When 
you move to another cell, 
QuickBooks springs into 
action, automatically 
clearing the check number 
out of the Number cell and 
the value out of the Pay-
ment cell. It also replaces 
the code CHK in the Type 
cell with DEP for deposit.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks keeps track of handwritten and printed check numbers separately. When you use the 
register window to create a check, QuickBooks fills in the Number cell by incrementing the last handwritten 
check number. When you choose File→Print Forms→Checks, the program fills in the First Check Number box 
by incrementing the last printed check number.
• Payment or Charge. For checks you write, fees that the bank deducts from your 
account, and petty cash withdrawals, type the amount in the Payment cell. In 
a credit card register, this field is named Charge so you can enter the values of 
the credit card charges you make.
• Deposit or Payment. For deposits you make to checking or petty cash, or inter­
est you’ve earned, type the amount in the Deposit cell. In a credit card register, 
this field is called Payment, because you make payments to a credit card account 
(the opposite of making payments from a checking account).
 NOTE 	 In QuickBooks transactions, money either goes out or comes in—there’s no in between. So when you 
enter a value in the Payment cell, QuickBooks clears the Deposit cell’s value and vice versa.

Keyboard Shortcuts for Dates
Pressing the + or – key on your keyboard to increment dates is 
a great timesaver, but you might also want to add some of the 
following keyboard shortcuts to your date-selection arsenal. 
When the cursor is in any Date field, these can help you jump 
directly to specific dates:
• Press T (for Today) to change the date to today.
• Press M (for Month) to select the first day of the currently 
selected month. Pressing M additional times jumps to the 
first days of previous months.
• Press H (for montH) to select the last day of the currently 
selected month. Pressing H additional times jumps to the 
last days of future months.
• Press W (for Week) to choose the first day of the currently 
selected week. Pressing W additional times jumps to the 
first days of previous weeks. 
• Press K (for weeK) to choose the last day of the currently 
selected week. Pressing K additional times jumps to the 
last days of future weeks.
• Press Y (for Year) to choose the first day of the currently 
selected year. Pressing Y additional times jumps to the 
first days of previous years.
• Press R (for yeaR) to choose the last day of the currently 
selected year. Pressing R additional times jumps to the 
last days of future years.
You can press these letters multiple times to pick dates further 
in the past or the future, and combine them with pressing + 
and – to reach any date you want. But face it: After half a dozen 
keystrokes, it might be easier to type a numeric date, such 
as 3/14/15, or to click the Calendar icon and choose the date.
• Account. This cell can play many roles. For instance, when you’re creating a 
check, choose the account for the expense it represents. If you’re making a 
deposit, choose the income or expense account to which you want to post 
the deposit. (For example, depositing an insurance claim check that pays for 
equipment repair reduces the balance of the expense account for equipment 
maintenance and repair.) If you’re transferring money to or from another bank 
account, choose that account instead.
• Memo. Filling in this cell can jog your memory no matter what type of transac­
tion you create. Enter the name of the restaurant for a credit card charge, the 
items you purchased with petty cash, or the bank branch for a deposit (in case 
your deposit ends up in someone else’s account).
 TIP 	 Remember your accountant’s insistence on an audit trail? If you create a transaction by mistake, don’t 
delete it. Although QuickBooks’ audit trail keeps track of deleted transactions, the omission can be confusing to 
others—or to you in the future.
Instead of deleting transactions, void them. That way, the payment or deposit amount changes to zero, but the 
voided transaction still appears in your company file, so you know that it happened. Because the amount is zero, 
the transaction doesn’t affect any account balances or financial reports. Before you void a transaction, type a 
note in its Memo cell that explains why you’re voiding it. Then, in a register window, right-click the transaction 
and choose the Void option (Void Check, Void Deposit, and so on) on the shortcut menu.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Managing Credit Card Accounts
Are credit cards accounts or vendors?
In QuickBooks, you can set up your credit cards as accounts or 
vendors, depending on how you prefer to record your credit 
card transactions. Here’s the deal:
• Credit card account. Tracking credit card charges using an 
account has several advantages. With a credit card account 
in QuickBooks, you can enter the charges as they happen 
(which takes no time at all if you download credit card 
transactions; page 617 explains how). Then, when you 
receive your statement, you can reconcile the credit card 
account as you would a checking account (page 390), so 
you can see whether your records and your charge card 
company’s match. To prevent credit card charge payee 
names from filling your Vendor List with entries you don’t 
need, store names in the Memo cell or create general 
vendors like Parking, Restaurant, and Office Supplies. 
• Credit card vendor. If you set up a credit card as a 
vendor, you don’t have an account to reconcile when 
you receive your credit card statement. In addition, the 
name of every establishment you bless with credit card 
purchases won’t fill up your Vendor List. The drawback to 
this approach is that you still have to allocate the money 
you spent to the appropriate accounts, and you can’t 
download that split transaction from your credit card 
company. With statement in hand, open the Enter Credit 
Card Charges window (choose Banking→Enter Credit 
Card Charges) to enter a single transaction allocating the 
total statement balance to each of the charges you made. 
(On the window’s Expenses and Items tabs, add entries 
to allocate charges to the appropriate expense accounts 
or item purchases.) That way, the transaction reconciles 
your charges to the statement.
Handling Bounced Checks
Bouncing one of your own checks is annoying and embarrassing. It can be expensive, 
too, since banks charge for each check you bounce (and, often, they craftily pay your 
larger checks before the smaller ones to rack up as many bounced-check charges as 
possible). Besides depositing money to cover the shortfall and paying those bank fees, 
you have to write new checks or tell people to redeposit the checks that bounced.
When someone pays your company with a rubber check, it’s just as annoying. In 
addition to the charges your bank might charge for redepositing a bounced check, 
you have to do a few things to straighten out your records in QuickBooks when a 
customer’s check bounces. The following sections explain how to handle bounced 
checks, whether you wrote them or your customer did.
Managing Bounced Checks You Wrote
If a bill payment you made overdraws your account, your bank returns the check to 
whomever you paid. You can handle this financial gaffe in a couple of ways. If your 
cash shortfall was a temporary problem, the easiest solution is to tell the vendor to 
redeposit your check. In that case, all you need to do is record your bank’s bounced-
check fee and enter a new bill for the bounced-check fee that your vendor charges you.

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
379
HANDLING 
BOUNCED 
CHECKS
Paying the bill with a new check or by credit card requires a few more steps. Here’s 
what you have to do:
1.	 Create a journal entry (page 426) to put the bad check’s amount back into 
your Accounts Payable account and your checking account.
To do that, in the journal entry’s first line, choose your checking account and 
fill in the Debit cell with the amount of the bounced check, as shown in Figure 
14-3 (foreground).
In the journal entry’s second line, choose your Accounts Payable account. (Quick­
Books automatically fills in the Credit cell with the bounced check’s amount, 
which is what you want.) In the Name cell, choose the vendor you paid. In the 
Memo cell, type something like “check bounced” or “NSF check.”
After you record the journal entry, the bad check amount shows up as billed in 
the Accounts Payable account (Figure 14-3, background) and as a deposit to 
your checking account.
FIGURE 14-3
Debiting your checking 
account deposits the bad 
check’s amount back 
into the account, which 
increases its balance, 
because the check hasn’t 
been cashed. 
Crediting the Accounts 
Payable account means 
that you still owe your 
vendor that money.
2.	 Edit the bill payment to switch the bill back to being unpaid.
In the Vendor Center (Vendors→Vendor Center), on the Vendors tab, select 
the vendor you paid with a bad check. In the window’s lower right, click the

HANDLING 
BOUNCED 
CHECKS
Transactions tab, and then in the Show drop-down list, choose Bill Payments. 
In the Transactions tab’s table, double-click the payment that bounced; the Bill 
Payments window opens. In the window’s Bills Paid In This Transaction table, 
turn off the Pay cell for the payment you made with a bad check, turn on the 
Pay checkbox for the journal entry, and then click Save & Close.
3.	 If the vendor charges you a fee for the bad check, create a bill for that charge.
Fill in this bill as you would any other bill (page 186). In the Expenses table, 
choose an expense account for the fee and enter the amount in the Amount cell.
4.	 Finally, pay the original bill and the additional-fee bill using your new pay­
ment method.
On the Home Page, click Pay Bills. In the Pay Bills window’s table, select the 
original bill (and the additional-fee bill, if you created one). In the Method box, 
choose how you want to pay the bill, and then click Pay Selected Bills.
 NOTE 	 See page 383 to learn how to record the fee that your bank charged you for overdrawing your account.
Now make a resolution to keep enough funds in your checking account to cover 
your payments.
Using the Record Bounced Check Feature
When a customer’s check bounces, it takes several steps to set things right—which is 
why you probably charge your customer an extra fee for your trouble. QuickBooks’ 
Record Bounced Check feature can help.
 TIP 	 The Record Bounced Check feature works by changing the original invoice’s status back to unpaid. This 
could lead to some confusion, especially if the invoice was paid in one fiscal year and you handle the bounced 
check in the next fiscal year. In addition, this feature works only with invoices paid with bounced checks—that is, 
you can’t use it to handle sales receipts paid with bounced checks. The next section describes another approach 
to handling customers’ bounced checks that works in any situation.
Here’s how to use the Record Bounced Check feature:
1.	 Open the Receive Payments window to the payment that bounced.
Choose Customers→Customer Center and then, on the Customers & Jobs tab, 
select the customer whose payment bounced. In the window’s lower right, click 
the Transactions tab, and then, in the Show drop-down list, choose Received 
Payments. Finally, double-click the payment that bounced.
2.	 At the top of the Receive Payments window, click Record Bounced Check.
The Manage Bounced Check dialog box opens (Figure 14-4).

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
381
HANDLING 
BOUNCED 
CHECKS
3.	 In the Bank Fee box, type the amount that your bank charged you for the 
customer’s bounced check. In the Expense Account box, choose the account 
you use for bank service charges.
When you complete the Record Bounced Check process, QuickBooks deducts 
this bank fee from your checking account balance.
FIGURE 14-4
The amount you enter 
in the Bank Fee box rep-
resents what your bank 
charged you for depositing 
the bounced check. Quick-
Books creates a transaction 
that deducts this fee from 
your checking account 
balance. 
The amount in the Cus-
tomer Fee box is what you 
charge your customer for 
giving you a bad check; it 
ends up on a new invoice 
that QuickBooks creates.
4.	 In the Customer Fee box, enter the amount you want to charge your 
customer.
For example, if your bank charged you $25 for your customer’s bad check and 
you want to tack on another $25 for the inconvenience, enter 50.
5.	 Click Next.
The Bounced Check Summary dialog box tells you that QuickBooks will mark the 
invoice corresponding to the bounced check as unpaid, deduct the bad check 
amount and bank fees from your bank account, and create a new invoice for 
the fee you’re charging the customer.
6.	 To set the bounced-check actions in motion, click Finish.
QuickBooks creates a journal entry that deducts the amount of the original 
invoice from your checking account.
7.	 Locate the journal entry QuickBooks created, and then add a note to its 
Memo field.
Choose Company→Make General Journal Entries and then, at the top left of the 
Make General Journal Entries window, click the Previous button (the left arrow) 
until you see the bounced check journal entry. Add a note to its Memo field such 
as “Bounced check 1234 for invoice 19012.” That way, you’ll know which invoice 
the bounced check is connected to.

hope the next check you get from them is good.
Handling Customers’ Bounced Checks on Your Own
As you learned in the previous section, the Record Bounced Check feature doesn’t 
work in all situations. Fortunately, with a bit of setup, you can easily handle custom­
ers’ bounced checks by re-invoicing your wayward customers. The steps are similar 
to the ones that the Record Bounced Check feature performs:
• Record a transaction that removes the amount of the bounced check from your 
checking account, because the money was never deposited.
• Record any charges that your bank levied on your account for your customer’s 
bounced check.
• Invoice the customer to recover the original payment, your bounced-check 
charges, and any additional charges you add for your trouble.
Before you can re-invoice your customers, you first need to create items for bounced 
checks and their associated charges, as explained in the following sections.
ITEM FOR REMOVING THE BOUNCED-CHECK AMOUNT FROM YOUR 
BANK ACCOUNT
When a check you deposit bounces, you’ll see two transactions on your next bank 
statement: the original deposit and a second transaction that removes the deposit 
amount. You have to create the same transactions in your company file so you don’t 
overestimate your bank balance and write bad checks of your own. And because 
the customer hasn’t really paid you, the amount of the check should go back into 
your Accounts Receivable account.
To create an item that removes the amount of the bounced check from your bank 
account, create an Other Charge item. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Lists→Item List to open the Item List window, and then press Ctrl+N.
The New Item window opens.
2.	 In the Type drop-down list, choose Other Charge.
The Other Charge item type is perfect for miscellaneous charges that don’t fit 
any other category.
3.	 In the Item Name/Number box, type a name for the item, like BadCheck. In 
the Account drop-down list, choose your bank account, and then click OK.
The new item appears in the Item List.
ITEMS FOR BOUNCED-CHECK SERVICE CHARGES
Companies typically request reimbursement for bounced-check charges, and many 
companies tack on additional service charges for the inconvenience of processing 
a bounced check. Depending on how you account for these charges, you’ll use one 
or two Other Charge items:

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
383
HANDLING 
BOUNCED 
CHECKS
• Bounced-check charge reimbursement. If you want your customer to pay 
you back for the bounced-check charge that your bank hit you with, you need 
an Other Charge item that you can add to an invoice, called something like 
BadCheck Charge. (Be sure to choose a nontaxable code for the item so that 
QuickBooks doesn’t calculate sales tax on it.)
QuickBooks doesn’t care whether you post this item to an income account or an 
expense account, but it’s easier to use an income account if you plan to charge 
customers an extra service charge for bounced checks, as you’ll learn shortly. 
If you post your bank’s bounced-check charges to an income account (such 
as a Service Charge account), then you can use the same item for any extra 
service charge you apply for the hassle of handling bounced checks. Although 
the customer’s reimbursement appears as income, the bank charge you paid 
is an expense. The effect on your net profit (income minus expenses) is zero.
• Bounced-check service charge. Alternatively, you can post bounced-check 
reimbursements directly to the same expense account you use for bank ser­
vice charges. With this approach, when you pay your bank’s bounced-check 
charge, it shows up as an expense in your bank service charge account. When 
the customer pays you back, QuickBooks credits the bank service charge ac­
count to reduce your service charge expenses. The effect on net profit is zero.
When you use this approach, you need an additional item if you ding your cus­
tomers with your own bounced-check service charges. Create an Other Charge 
item for the additional service charge. For the item’s Account, choose your 
service-charge income account. Like the bounced-check charge reimbursement 
item, make this item nontaxable.
Recording Bank Charges
The easiest place to record a bounced-check charge is in the bank account’s register 
window. This technique works for any charge your bank drops on your account, and 
for service charges and interest your credit card company levies:
1.	 Press Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window; there, double-click 
your bank account to open its register window.
Alternatively, on the Home Page, click Check Register. In the Select Account 
box’s drop-down list, choose your bank account, and then click OK.
2.	 In the Date cell for the first blank transaction, choose the date when the 
bank assessed the charge.
QuickBooks automatically fills in the Number cell with the next check number. 
Be sure to delete that number before saving the transaction to keep your Quick­
Books check numbers synchronized with your paper checks.
3.	 In the Payee cell, type a generic payee name like Bank Charge.
Alternatively, you can type the name of your bank or credit card company.

HANDLING 
BOUNCED 
CHECKS
4.	 Type the details of the charge in the Memo cell, as shown in Figure 14-5.
For a bounced-check charge, include the name of the customer, a note that the 
check bounced, and the number of the check that bounced.
FIGURE 14-5
In the Memo cell, type a 
description of the bank charge, 
such as “bounced check 
charge,” “minimum balance 
charge,” the bounced check’s 
number, and so on.
5.	 In the Payment cell, type the amount of the charge. In the Account cell, choose 
the account you use to track bank charges or bounced-check charges.
For a bounced-check charge, choose the income or expense account you use 
for that purpose. (You have to include a bounced-check charge item on a new 
invoice in order to recoup this cost, as described in the next section.) For other 
bank service charges, choose the corresponding expense account.
 TIP 	 The register window’s Customer:Job cell provides a shortcut to invoicing a customer for bounced-check 
charges: While the transaction is still selected in the register window, click Splits to open the Splits table. The 
Account, Amount, and Memo fields are already filled in with the values you’ve provided so far. To make the bank 
charge billable to the customer who bounced the check, in the Customer:Job cell, choose the customer, and in 
the “Billable?” cell, turn on the checkbox. You can then add this billable charge to the customer’s next invoice 
(as described in step 5 on page 253).
6.	 Click Record.
QuickBooks saves the bank charge in your account.
Re-invoicing for Bounced Checks
With the bounced-check items described on page 383, you can update all the nec­
essary account balances just by re-invoicing the customer for the bounced check. 
Here are the steps:
1.	 Press Ctrl+I or, on the Home Page, click the Create Invoices icon (or choose 
Invoices→Create Invoices if you’ve set up QuickBooks Permier or Enterprise 
to invoice for billable time and expenses.
The Create Invoices window opens.

2.	 In the Customer:Job box, choose the customer who wrote the bad check.
You don’t have to bother filling in fields like P.O. No. and Ship.
3.	 In the item table, add an item for the bounced check (like the BadCheck 
item in Figure 14-6).
FIGURE 14-6
To re-invoice the customer 
for the amount of the bad 
check, in the first Item cell, 
choose your bounced-
check item (BadCheck, 
in this example). In the 
Amount cell, type the 
bounced check’s amount. 
In the second item cell, 
choose the item you 
created for bounced-
check charges. This item’s 
amount represents what 
the bank charged you and 
any additional service fee 
you charge.
4.	 In the Amount cell for the bounced-check item, type the amount of the 
returned check.
Enter the check’s full amount.
5.	 Add a second item to recoup the bounced-check fees that your bank charged 
you and any additional service charges you want to include. In the Amount 
cell for this item, type the amount you’re charging.
Adding an extra fee can help deter customers from writing bad checks. In Figure 
14-6, the BadCheck Charge item covers the bank’s $25 charge plus an additional 
$25 fee your company collects.
If you recorded the bounced-check charge in your bank account as a billable cost 
to your customer (see the Tip on page 384), at the top of the Create Invoices 
window, click Add Time/Costs. In the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog 
box, click the Expenses tab and select the bank charge, and then click OK to 
add it to the invoice. Then you can add another line item to add your bounced 
check fee to the invoice.
6.	 Click Save & Close to save the invoice.
QuickBooks updates the balances of your bank account and Accounts Receiv­
able accounts, as shown in Figure 14-7, which is exactly what you want. Here’s 
why: When you first invoiced the customer, QuickBooks added the invoice

amount to your Accounts Receivable balance. The customer’s original payment 
reduced the Accounts Receivable balance, but the bounced check means you 
have to remove the original payment amount from your records. By re-invoicing 
the customer, you reestablish the balance as outstanding and add the invoice 
amount back into Accounts Receivable.
FIGURE 14-7
The item for a bounced

check and service charges 
back into Accounts Receiv-
able (foreground).
7.	 When the customer sends you a check for this new invoice, click the Receive 
Payments icon on the Home Page to apply that check to the new invoice 
as a payment.
QuickBooks reduces the Accounts Receivable balance by the payment amount. 
(If your customer and the money it owes you are gone for good, see the box 
on page 387 to learn what to do next.)
Transferring Funds
With the advent of electronic banking services, transferring funds between accounts 
has become a staple of account maintenance. Companies stash cash in savings and 
money market accounts to earn interest and then transfer money into checking 
right before they pay bills.

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Writing Off Bad Debt
If you try contacting a customer about a payment only to find 
that his phone is disconnected, his forwarding address has 
expired, and an eviction notice is stapled to his office door, 
you probably aren’t going to get your money. In accounting, 
admitting that the money is gone for good is called writing 
off bad debt.
The invoice you create for a customer represents income only 
if the customer pays it. So, to write off bad debt, you have to 
remove the income for the unpaid invoice from your financial 
records. You do that by offsetting the income with an equal 
amount of expense—you guessed it: the bad debt.
Suppose you invoiced a customer for $5,000, which means 
that $5,000 is sitting in your Accounts Receivable account as 
an asset, but you now realize that you’ll never see the money. 
Here’s how to remove that money from the Accounts Receivable 
account by means of a bad-debt expense:
1.	 If you don’t have an account for bad debt, create an Other 
Expense account (page 56) and name it Bad Debt.
2.	 Create an Other Charge item (page 113) and name it Bad 
Debt. Point it to the Bad Debt account you created, and 
be sure to make it nontaxable.
3.	 Choose Customers→Create Credit Memos/Refunds or, on 
the Home Page, click the Refunds & Credits icon.
4.	 In the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window’s Customer: 
Job box, choose the customer. 
5.	 In the first item cell, choose the Bad Debt item. When 
QuickBooks displays a warning about the item being 
associated with an expense account, simply click OK.
6.	 In the Amount cell, type the amount that you’re writing 
off as bad debt, and then click Save & Close to save the 
credit memo.
7.	 The Available Credit dialog box opens and asks you what 
you want to do with the credit. Select the “Apply to an 
invoice” option, and then click OK.
8.	 In the “Apply Credit to Invoices” dialog box, turn on the 
checkmark for the invoice(s) that the customer isn’t going 
to pay, and then click Done.
When you apply the write-off as a credit against an invoice, 
QuickBooks removes the money from your Accounts Receivable 
account, so the program no longer thinks your customer owes 
the money. And it adds the credit amount to the appropriate 
income account and to the Bad Debt expense account, so your 
net profit shows no sign of the income. In addition, if you run 
a Job Profitability Detail report for that customer, the bad 
debt appears as a negative number in the Actual Revenue 
column—that is, a cost that reduces the job’s profitability.
Funds transfers have nothing to do with income or expenses—they merely move 
money from one balance sheet account to another. For example, if you keep money 
in savings until you pay bills, the money moves from your savings account (an asset 
account in your chart of accounts) to your checking account (another asset account). 
Your income, expenses, and, for that matter, your total assets, remain the same 
before and after the transfer.
Transferring funds in QuickBooks is easy, whether you use the Transfer Funds 
feature or enter the transaction directly in an account register window. The steps 
for creating a transaction in an account register are explained on page 374. If you 
create a transfer in a bank account register (a savings account, for example), in the 
transaction’s Account field, choose the bank account to which you’re transferring 
funds (such as checking).

TRANSFERRING 
FUNDS
Here’s how to use the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window:
1.	 Choose Banking→Transfer Funds.
QuickBooks opens the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window (Figure 14-8).
FIGURE 14-8
This window has one 
advantage over entering 
transfers in a bank account 
register: You can’t create 
a payment or deposit 
by mistake because you 
can’t save it here until you 
specify both the account 
that contains the money 
and the account into which 
you want to transfer the 
funds. Also, the Transfer 
Funds From and Transfer 
Funds To drop-down 
menus show only balance 
sheet accounts (bank, 
credit card, asset, liability, 
and equity).
2.	 Choose the accounts for the transfer and then, in the Date box, select the 
date of the transfer. In the Transfer Amount field, type the amount you’re 
transferring.
To record the reason for the transfer, in the Memo box, replace “Funds Transfer” 
(which QuickBooks adds automatically) with your reason.
If you track classes, the window also includes a Class box. Depending on the 
preferences you’ve set, the program might warn you if you leave this box blank. 
However, transfers usually don’t require a class assignment, so you can dismiss 
the warning or choose a class for overhead, if you created one.
 NOTE 	 If the two accounts you select are both set up for online banking at the same financial institution, 
the Online Funds Transfer checkbox appears in the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window. Turn this checkbox 
on if you want to send the transfer instructions to your bank through QuickBooks.
3.	 Click Save & Close. (If you’ve got more transfers to make, click Save & New 
instead.)
In the account register windows for both accounts involved in the transfer, 
QuickBooks identifies the transaction by putting TRANSFR in the Type cell.

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards

ACCOUNTS
You still have to transfer the funds between your real-world bank accounts, of course. 
If you turned on the Online Funds Transfer checkbox to send the transfer instruc­
tions, you have to open the Bank Feeds Center (Banking→Bank Feeds→Bank Feeds 
Center), and send the instructions from there. See page 617 if you use Bank Feeds 
in Express mode and page 627 if you use Classic mode.
Reconciling Accounts
Reconciling a bank statement with a paper check register is tedious and error-prone. 
It’s a hassle to check off items on two different paper documents, and the check 
register and the bank statement never seem to agree—likely due to arithmetic 
mistakes you’ve made.
With QuickBooks, you can leave your pencils unsharpened and stow your calculator 
in a drawer. When all goes well, a few clicks is all it takes to reconcile your account in 
QuickBooks. Discrepancies crop up less often because the program does the math 
without making mistakes. But problems still occasionally happen—transactions 
might be missing or numbers don’t match. Fortunately, when your bank statement 
and QuickBooks account don’t agree, the program helps you find the problems.
Preparing for the First Reconciliation
If you didn’t set the beginning balance for your QuickBooks account to the begin­
ning balance on your bank statement, you might wonder how you can reconcile the 
bank account the first time around. The best way to resolve this issue is to enter the 
transactions that happened between that statement’s beginning date and the day 
you started using QuickBooks. Or you can create a journal entry (page 426) to record 
the beginning balance. (You’ll select these items as part of your first reconciliation, 
as described on page 392.)
 NOTE 	 Alternatively, QuickBooks can align your statement and account the first time you reconcile, as 
described in the box on page 394. To do so, the program generates a transaction that adjusts your account’s 
opening balance to match the balance on your bank statement. Account opening balances post to your Opening 
Bal Equity account, so these adjustments affect your balance sheet. If you use this method, let your accountant 
know that you changed the opening balance so she can address that change (by recording a journal entry to 
move the money into the correct equity account) while closing your books at the end of the year.
Preparing for Every Reconciliation
QuickBooks lets you create and edit transactions in the middle of a reconciliation, 
but reconciling your account flows more smoothly when your transactions are up 
to date. So take a moment before you reconcile to make sure that you’ve entered 
all the transactions in your account:
• Bills. If you paid bills by writing paper checks and forgot to record them in 
QuickBooks, then on the program’s Home Page, click the Pay Bills icon and 
enter those payments (page 194).

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
390
RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
• Checks. If you find that checks aren’t in your checkbook but you don’t see 
check transactions in QuickBooks, chances are that you wrote a paper check 
and didn’t record it in your company file. Create any missing check transactions 
in the account register (page 205) or by choosing Banking→Write Checks.
• Transfers. Create missing transfers in the appropriate account register (page 
374) or by choosing Banking→Transfer Funds.
• Deposits. If you forgot to record deposits of customer payments in QuickBooks, 
on the program’s Home Page, click the Record Deposits icon to add them to 
your bank account (page 368). If a deposit appears on your bank statement but 
doesn’t show up in the “Payments to Deposit” window, you might have forgot­
ten to receive the payment in QuickBooks. For deposits unrelated to customer 
payments, create the deposit directly in the account’s register (page 374).
 TIP 	 The easiest way to spot payments you haven’t deposited in QuickBooks is to open the “Payments to 
Deposit” window (Banking→Make Deposits). Any payments that you’ve received but not deposited in QuickBooks 
appear in the window’s Select Payments To Deposit table.
• Online transactions. If you use QuickBooks’ Bank Feeds feature to communicate 
with your bank, download online transactions (page 617).
 TIP 	 If you let several months go by without reconciling your account, don’t try to reconcile multiple months 
at once to catch up—doing so makes discrepancies harder to spot, and locating the source of problems will tax 
your already-overworked brain. Instead, put your bank statements in chronological order, and then walk through 
the reconciliation process for each statement.
Starting a Reconciliation
Reconciling an account is a two-part process, and QuickBooks has separate windows 
for each phase. The first phase includes choosing the account you want to recon­
cile, entering the ending balance from your bank statement, and entering service 
charges and interest earned during the statement period. Here’s how to kick off a 
reconciliation:
1.	 Click the Reconcile icon on the Home Page or choose Banking→Reconcile (or 
Banking→Reconcile Credit Card if you have a credit card account selected 
in the Chart of Accounts window).
The Begin Reconciliation window appears.
 TIP 	 If the bank account’s register window is already open, you can start reconciling by right-clicking the 
register window and choosing Reconcile on the shortcut menu that appears. With this approach, the Begin 
Reconciliation window opens and automatically selects the active bank account.

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
391
RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
2.	 In the Begin Reconciliation window’s Account drop-down list, choose the 
account you want to reconcile.
The window displays information about the previous reconciliation for this ac­
count (if any), as shown in Figure 14-9. The date of the previous reconciliation 
appears to the right of the Account box (unless you’re reconciling this account 
for the first time). QuickBooks fills in the Statement Date box with a date one 
month after the previous reconciliation date. If that date doesn’t match your 
bank statement’s ending date, replace it with the date from your statement.
QuickBooks automatically sets the beginning balance for this reconciliation to 
the ending balance of the previous reconciliation (unless this is your first recon­
ciliation). If the beginning balance that the program displays doesn’t match the 
beginning balance on your bank statement, you need to correct that discrepancy 
before you can reconcile your account. Click Cancel and turn to page 396 to 
learn how to fix the problem.
FIGURE 14-9
QuickBooks uses the 
ending balance from the 
previous reconciliation to 
fill in the beginning bal-
ance for this reconciliation. 
If the beginning balance 
here doesn’t match the 
beginning balance on 
your bank statement, click 
Cancel and turn to page 
396 to learn how to correct 
the problem.
3.	 In the Ending Balance box, type the ending balance from your bank 
statement.
If you turned on multiple currencies, the account’s currency appears to the right 
of the Beginning Balance and Ending Balance labels. For a foreign-currency 
account, enter the ending balance in the foreign currency, which is the ending 
balance that appears on your bank statement.
4.	 If your bank levies a service charge on your account, in the Service Charge 
box, type the charge amount. (If you download transactions from your 
bank, leave this box blank.)
In the Date box to the right of the Service Charge box, choose the date that the 
charge was assessed if it differs from the statement ending date. In the Account 
box, choose the account to which you want to post the charge (usually Bank

Service Charges or something similar). QuickBooks then creates a service-charge 
transaction for you.
 TIP 	 If you use Bank Feeds (page 611), chances are you’ve already downloaded your service-charge and interest 
transactions. In that case, don’t enter them in the Begin Reconciliation window or you’ll end up with duplicate 
transactions.
5.	 If you’re reconciling an account that pays interest, in the Interest Earned 
box, type the interest listed on your bank statement.
As you did in step 4 for the service charge, specify the date and the account 
that you use to track interest.
 NOTE 	 If you track service fees and interest earned by class, in the Class boxes, choose the appropriate ones. 
For example, classes might apply if you use them to track performance by region. However, if you use classes 
to track sales by partner, you don’t have to specify a class for interest earned, though you can use a class for 
overhead if you created one.
6.	 Click Continue to start reconciling individual transactions.
QuickBooks opens the Reconcile window, where you reconcile transactions, 
as described next.
Reconciling Transactions
The Reconcile window groups checks and payments on the left side and deposits 
and other credits on the right side. (For a credit card account, charges and cash ad­
vances appear on the left side of the window—since they reduce your balance—and 
payments and credits appear on the right side.) Marking transactions as cleared is 
a simple matter of turning on their checkmarks, as you can see in Figure 14-10. For 
each transaction that appears on your bank statement, turn on the checkmark for 
the matching QuickBooks transaction. (If you turn on a checkmark by mistake, just 
click it again to turn it off.)
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks initially sorts transactions by date with the earliest transaction listed first. If you want to 
sort them by another field, click the column heading for that field. For example, click “Chk #” if you’re trying to 
find the check that’s preventing you from reconciling successfully. An up arrow next to the heading indicates that 
the column is sorted in ascending order (smallest to largest values). Click the column heading again to reverse 
the order (largest to smallest).

cord the service-charge or 
interest amount, click the 
Modify button to reopen 
the Begin Reconciliation 
window.
 TIP 	 Initially, the Reconcile window lists all uncleared transactions in the account regardless of when they 
happened. If transactions after the statement ending date are mixed in, you could select unnecessary transactions 
by mistake. To filter the list to likely candidates for clearing, turn on the “Hide transactions after the statement’s 
end date” checkbox at the top right of the window. If you don’t see transactions that appear on your bank state­
ment, turn this checkbox off; you might have created a transaction with the wrong date.
QuickBooks includes several shortcuts for marking a transaction as cleared:
• Mark All. If you usually end up clearing most of the transactions in the list, 
click Mark All below the table to select all the transactions. Then turn off the 
checkmarks for the ones that don’t appear on your bank statement. If you 
were distracted and selected several transactions by mistake, click Unmark All 
to start over.
• Selecting contiguous transactions. Dragging down the checkmark column 
selects every transaction you pass. (This approach isn’t that helpful if you 
compare one transaction at a time or if your transactions don’t appear in the 
same order as those on your bank statement.)

• Online account access. If you’ve set up Bank Feeds in QuickBooks, click Matched 
to automatically clear the transactions that you’ve already matched from your 
QuickStatement (see Chapter 24). Enter the ending date from your printed 
statement, and then click OK.
When the Difference value in the window’s lower right changes to 0.00, your rec­
onciliation is a success. To officially complete the process, click Reconcile Now. The 
Select Reconciliation Report dialog box opens (it’s described in the next section). 
If you don’t want to print a reconciliation report, simply click Close.
 NOTE 	 When you reconcile a credit card account and then click Reconcile Now, QuickBooks opens the Make 
Payments window. There you can choose to write a check or enter a bill to make a payment toward your credit 
card balance.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Adjusting an Account That Won’t Reconcile
When the Difference value in the Reconcile window obstinately 
refuses to change to 0.00, reconciling without finding the 
problem is an option. For example, if you’re one penny off 
and you can’t solve the problem with a quick review, that 1 
cent isn’t worth any more of your time. As you complete the 
reconciliation, QuickBooks can add an adjustment transaction 
to make up the difference. You can also use this adjustment 
to correct the beginning balance for your first reconciliation.
In the Reconcile window, if you click Reconcile Now without 
zeroing the Difference value, QuickBooks opens the Reconcile 
Adjustment dialog box. The program tells you what you 
already know: that there’s an unresolved difference between 
the Ending Balance from your bank statement and the Cleared 
Balance in QuickBooks. If you want to try to fix the problem, 
click “Return to Reconcile.” If you want to research the problem, 
click Leave Reconcile. (When you restart the reconciliation, all 
the work you’ve done so far will still be there.)
To create an adjustment transaction, click Enter Adjustment, 
and QuickBooks creates a journal entry to zero out the balance. 
If you stumble across the source of the discrepancy later, 
you can either void the adjustment journal entry or create a 
reversing entry (page 431).
Modifying Transactions During Reconciliation
QuickBooks immediately updates the Reconcile window with changes you make in 
the bank account’s register window, so it’s easy to complete a reconciliation. Missing 
transactions? Incorrect amounts? Other discrepancies? No problem. You can jump 
to the register window and make your changes. Then, when you click back to the 
Reconcile window, the changes are there.
 TIP 	 If you’ve opened both the bank account’s register window and the reconciliation window, click the one 
you want to work on. If you use the left icon bar, click Open Windows in the bar’s middle section to see a list of 
the open windows at the top of the bar; simply click the name of the one you want to work with. If you use the 
top icon bar, choose View→Open Window List to display the Open Windows list on the left side of the QuickBooks 
window; you can then click names there to change the active window or dialog box.

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards

RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
Here’s how to make changes while reconciling:
• Adding transactions. If a transaction appears on your bank statement but isn’t 
in QuickBooks, switch to the account’s register window or the transaction’s cor­
responding window (such as Write Checks) and add the transaction.
• Deleting transactions. If you find duplicate transactions, in the account’s reg­
ister window, right-click the transaction and choose the corresponding Delete 
entry on the shortcut menu (or select the transaction and then press Ctrl+D). 
When you confirm your decision and QuickBooks deletes the transaction, the 
transaction also disappears from the Reconcile window.
• Editing transactions. If you notice an error in a transaction, in the Reconcile 
window, double-click the transaction to open its corresponding window (Write 
Checks for checks, Make Deposits for deposits, and so on). Correct the mistake, 
and then save the transaction by clicking Record or Save, depending on the 
window.
Stopping and Restarting a Reconciliation
If your head hurts and you need a break, you don’t need to worry about losing the 
reconciliation work you’ve already done—QuickBooks saves it for you. Here’s how 
to stop and restart a reconciliation:
1.	 In the Reconcile window, click Leave.
Although QuickBooks closes the window, it remembers what you’ve done. If you 
open the bank account’s register window, you’ll see asterisks in the checkmark 
column for transactions that you’ve marked as cleared, which indicates that 
your clearing of that transaction is pending.
2.	 When you’re reenergized, open the account’s register window, right-click 
it, and then choose Reconcile on the shortcut menu.
The Begin Reconciliation window opens with the ending balance, service charge, 
and interest amounts already filled in.
3.	 Click Continue.
The transactions you marked are, happily, still marked. Pick up where you left 
off by marking the rest of the transactions that cleared on your bank statement.
Reconciliation Reports
After you click Reconcile Now in the Reconcile window, you might notice a short delay 
while QuickBooks generates your reconciliation reports. These reports may come in 
handy as a benchmark when you try to locate discrepancies in a future reconciliation.
When the Select Reconciliation Report dialog box opens, you can display or print 
reconciliation reports. Choose the Summary option for a report that provides the 
totals for the checks and payments you made, and for the deposits and credits you 
received. To save the reports for future reference, click Print. Click Close to close

Correcting Discrepancies
If you modify a transaction that you’ve already reconciled, QuickBooks displays a 
dialog box warning you that you changed a reconciled transaction and that your 
change will affect your reconciliation balance. After all, if you cleared a transaction 
because it appeared on your bank statement, the transaction is complete, and 
changing it in QuickBooks doesn’t change it in your bank account. 
While you technically can change or delete cleared transactions in QuickBooks, do­
ing so is usually a bad idea. The one situation that usually calls for editing reconciled 
transactions is when you’re trying to correct a reconciliation problem. This section 
explains what causes discrepancies, how to hunt down transactions that are causing 
problems, and how to edit transactions to fix discrepancies.

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
397
RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
Changing previously cleared transactions is the quickest way to cause mayhem 
when reconciling accounts. A typical reconciliation problem is when the beginning 
balance that QuickBooks fills in doesn’t match the beginning balance on your bank 
statement, which is one reason you might be reading this section. Here are some of 
the most common causes of discrepancies:
• Changing the cleared status of a reconciled transaction. In an account register 
window, you might click a checkmark cell by mistake, which resets the status 
of that transaction from reconciled (indicated by a checkmark) to cleared (in­
dicated by an asterisk). This change removes that transaction’s amount from 
the Begin Reconciliation window’s Beginning Balance when you try to reconcile 
the account.
• Editing a reconciled transaction’s amount. Changing a reconciled transac­
tion’s amount doesn’t change the amount on your bank statement, but it does 
affect the beginning balance that QuickBooks calculates.
• Deleting a reconciled transaction. Suppose you recorded a transaction using 
the wrong QuickBooks feature, such as writing a check in the Write Checks 
window to remit your sales tax instead of using the Pay Sales Tax dialog box. 
Then, to make matters worse, you reconcile that incorrect transaction as part 
of your bank account reconciliation. If you delete the check so you can pay the 
sales tax using the correct QuickBooks feature, your beginning reconciliation 
balance won’t agree with the one on your bank statement. 
To fix the error, in the bank account register window, delete the transaction that 
you recorded using the wrong method by right-clicking the transaction and then 
choosing “Delete [transaction]” from the shortcut menu. (In this example, the 
transaction is a check to pay sales tax, so you would choose Delete Check, but 
it could be a check for payroll or another type of transaction.) Then recreate the 
transaction using the Pay Sales Tax feature. Now your sales tax is paid the right 
way, but your beginning balance is messed up due to the deleted transaction; 
see “Re-reconciling corrected transactions” on page 398 to learn how to fix that.
USING THE DISCREPANCY REPORT TO FIND PROBLEM TRANSACTIONS
If your bank statement and QuickBooks records don’t agree and you don’t know 
why, the Discrepancy Report can help you find the transactions that are the culprits. 
This report shows changes that were made to reconciled transactions, so you can 
restore them to their original states.
To run the Discrepancy Report, in the Begin Reconciliation window, click Locate 
Discrepancies, and then, in the Locate Discrepancies window, click Discrepancy 
Report. (You can also choose Reports→Banking→Reconciliation Discrepancy.)
Seeing transactions on the Discrepancy Report is a big step toward correcting rec­
onciliation problems. Here’s how to interpret the report’s crucial columns:

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
398
RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
• Entered/Last Modified. This is the date that the transaction was created or 
modified, which might help you figure out who’s changing reconciled transac­
tions.
• Reconciled Amount. This column shows the value the transaction had when 
you reconciled it. If the transaction’s amount has been changed, use this value to 
restore the transaction to its original value. For example, –99.95 in this column 
represents a check or charge for $99.95.
• Type of Change. This column indicates what aspect of the transaction was 
changed. For example, “Amount” means that the transaction’s amount changed, 
“Uncleared” indicates that someone removed the transaction’s reconciled 
checkmark in the account register, and “Deleted” means that the transaction 
was deleted.
 TIP 	 The only way to restore a deleted transaction is to recreate it from scratch. The Discrepancy Report 
identifies deleted transactions, but it doesn’t provide the details you need to recreate them. To see those details, 
choose Reports→Accountant & Taxes→Voided/Deleted Transactions Detail. This report includes every bit of info 
about the transaction, so you can recreate it in all its original glory.
• Effect of Change. This value indicates how the change affected the beginning 
balance of your reconciliation. For example, a $99.95 check that was reset added 
$99.95 to your bank account. When the Beginning Balance is off and the amount 
in this column matches that discrepancy, you can be sure that restoring these 
transactions to their original states will fix the problem.
Once you identify a transaction that was edited after it was reconciled, in the Previous 
Reconciliations Discrepancy Report window, double-click the transaction to open 
it in its corresponding window (for example, the Write Checks window for a check). 
If a transaction’s status was reset from reconciled to cleared, open the account’s 
register (page 374), find the transaction, and then click its checkmark cell until a 
checkmark (which represents a reconciled transaction) appears.
 TIP 	 If your beginning balance is still off after you correct cleared statuses, amounts, and deleted transac­
tions, run the Audit Trail report (page 437) to look for other changes that could throw off your reconciliation (for 
example, a transaction whose account was changed).
RE-RECONCILING CORRECTED TRANSACTIONS
If you fix changes that were made to reconciled transactions, you then have to re-
reconcile those transactions. Fortunately, you can perform a surgical reconciliation 
to accept these transactions. Here are the steps:
1.	 Choose Banking→Reconcile and then, in the Begin Reconciliation window’s 
Account drop-down list, choose the bank account you want to re-reconcile 
(if it isn’t already selected).

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
399
RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
2.	 Change the date in the Statement Date box to the date on the bank state­
ment that contains the transaction you corrected.
For example, if the transaction you corrected was made on February 15, fill in 
the statement date for your February bank statement.
3.	 In the Ending Balance box, fill in the ending balance from the bank state­
ment (the February statement, in this example), and then click Continue.
The Reconcile window opens.
4.	 In the Reconcile window, find the corrected transactions in the Checks and 
Payments list and click their checkmark cells to turn on their checkmarks.
When you do so, the Difference value changes to 0.00.
5.	 Click Reconcile Now to complete this mini-reconciliation.
The next time you reconcile the account, the beginning balance will match the 
beginning balance on your bank statement.
OTHER WAYS TO FIND DISCREPANCIES
Sometimes, your QuickBooks records don’t match your bank’s records because of 
subtle errors in transactions or because you’ve missed something in the current 
reconciliation. The following techniques can help you spot problems:
• Search for a transaction equal to the amount of the discrepancy. Press Ctrl+F 
to open the Find window. On the Advanced tab, in the Choose Filter list, select 
Amount. Next, choose the = option and type the amount in the text box, and 
then click Find to run the search.
You can also use the Search feature to find a transaction for that amount: Press 
F3 to open the Search window. In the Amount box, type the amount of the 
discrepancy, and then click Go. If you use the left icon bar, you can also type 
the amount of the discrepancy in the Search box at the top of the bar, and then 
click the Search icon (it looks like a magnifying glass).
 NOTE 	 Using Find or Search in this way works only if the discrepancy is caused by one transaction that you 
cleared or uncleared by mistake. If more than one transaction is to blame, the amount you’re trying to find is the 
total of all the erroneously cleared transactions, so these methods won’t find a matching value.
• Look for transactions cleared or uncleared by mistake. Sometimes, the easi­
est way to find a discrepancy is to start the reconciliation over. In the Reconcile 
window, click Unmark All to remove the checkmarks from all the transactions. 
Then begin checking them off as you compare them with your bank statement. 
Make sure that every transaction on the statement is cleared in the Reconcile 
window, and that no additional transactions are cleared in that window.
• Look for duplicate transactions. If you create transactions in QuickBooks 
and download transactions from your bank’s website, it’s easy to end up with 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
400
RECONCILING 
ACCOUNTS
duplicates. And when you clear both of the duplicates, the mistake is hard to 
spot. If that’s the case, you have to scroll through the register window looking 
for multiple transactions with the same date, payee, and amount.
• Compare the number of transactions on your bank statement with the 
number of cleared transactions on the left side of the Reconcile window 
(Figure 14-12). Of course, this technique won’t help if you enter transactions in 
QuickBooks differently than they appear on your bank statement. For example, 
if you deposit every payment individually but your bank shows one deposit for 
every business day, then your transaction counts won’t match.
• Look for a deposit entered as a payment or vice versa. To find an error like 
this, look for transactions whose amounts are half the discrepancy. For example, 
if a $500 check becomes a $500 deposit by mistake, your reconciliation will 
be off by $1,000: $500 because a check is missing and another $500 because 
you have an extra deposit.
FIGURE 14-12
As you clear transactions 
in the Reconcile window’s 
table, QuickBooks updates 
the number of items 
you’ve marked at the 
window’s bottom left, 
below the “Items you have 
marked cleared” heading. 
Compare these values with 
the number of transactions 
on your bank statement. If 
the numbers don’t agree, 
you know to look for either 
a transaction you forgot 
to clear or one that you 
cleared by mistake.
• Look at each cleared transaction for transposed numbers or other differ­
ences between your statement and QuickBooks. It’s easy to type $95.40 
when you mean $59.40.
 NOTE 	 If these techniques don’t uncover the problem, your bank might have made a mistake. See page 401 
to learn what to do in that case.

Undoing the Last Reconciliation
If you’re having problems with this month’s reconciliation but suspect that the culprit 
is hiding in last month’s reconciliation, you can undo the last reconciliation and start 
over. When you undo a reconciliation, QuickBooks returns the transactions in it to 
an uncleared state.
In the Begin Reconciliation window (choose Banking→Reconcile), click Undo Last 
Reconciliation to open the Undo Previous Reconciliation dialog box. (Although the 
button’s label and the dialog box’s title don’t match, they both represent the same 
process.) In the dialog box, click Continue. When the Undo Previous Reconciliation 
message box appears telling you that the previous reconciliation has been success­
fully undone, click OK.
QuickBooks unclears all the transactions back to the beginning of the previous rec­
onciliation and returns you to the Begin Reconciliation window. Change the values 
in the dialog box, and then click Continue to try another reconciliation.
 NOTE 	 Although this process makes QuickBooks remove the cleared status from all the transactions included 
in your last reconciliation, including service charges and interest, the program doesn’t remove the service charge 
and interest transactions that it added. So when you restart the reconciliation, don’t re-enter the service charges 
or interest in the Begin Reconciliation window.
When Your Bank Makes a Mistake
Banks do make mistakes: Digits get transposed or amounts are flat wrong. When 
this happens, you can’t ignore the discrepancy. In QuickBooks, add an adjustment 
transaction (page 394) to make up the difference, and be sure to tell your bank 
about the mistake. (It’s always a good idea to be polite in case the error turns out 
to be yours.)
When you receive your next statement, check that the bank made an adjustment to 
correct its mistake. You can then delete your adjustment transaction or add a revers­
ing journal entry to remove your adjustment and reconcile as you normally would.
 TIP 	 For a reminder to check your next statement, create a To Do Note (choose Company→To Do List, and 
then click Add To Do).
Managing Loans
Unless your business generates cash at an astonishing rate, you’ll probably have 
to borrow money to purchase big-ticket items that you can’t afford to do without, 
such as a deluxe cat-herding machine.
In real life, the asset you purchase and the loan you assume are intimately linked—you 
can’t get the equipment without borrowing the money. But in QuickBooks, loans 
and the assets they help purchase aren’t connected in any way. You create an asset 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
402
MANAGING 
LOANS
account to track the purchase price of an asset that you buy. If you take out a loan 
to pay for that asset, you create a liability account to track the balance of what you 
owe on the loan. With each payment you make on the loan, you pay off a little bit 
of the loan’s principal as well as a chunk of interest.
 NOTE 	 On your company’s balance sheet, the value of your assets appears in the Assets section, and the 
balance you owe on loans shows up in the Liabilities section. The difference between the asset value and the loan 
balance is your equity in the asset. For example, suppose your cat-herding machine is in primo condition and is 
worth $70,000 on the open market. If you owe $50,000 on the loan, then your company has $20,000 in equity in 
that machine.
Most loans amortize your payoff, which means that each payment represents a dif­
ferent amount of interest and principal. At the beginning of a loan, amortized pay­
ments are mostly interest and very little principal; that means the lender gets more 
of its money up front, but it’s also great for your company’s tax deductions. By the 
end of the loan’s life cycle, the payments are almost entirely principal. 
Making loan payments in which the values change each month would be a nightmare 
if not for Loan Manager, a separate program that comes with QuickBooks that can 
exchange info with your company file. Loan Manager calculates your loan’s amortiza­
tion schedule, posts the principal and interest for each payment to the appropriate 
accounts, and handles escrow payments and fees associated with your loans. This 
section explains how to use it.
 NOTE 	 Loan Manager doesn’t handle loans in which the payment covers only the accrued interest (called 
interest-only loans). For loans like these, you have to set up payments yourself (page 408) and allocate payments 
to principal and interest using the values on your monthly loan statements.
Setting Up a Loan
Regardless of whether you use Loan Manager, you have to create accounts in 
QuickBooks to keep track of your loan. You probably already know that you need a 
liability account for the amount of money you owe. You also need accounts for the 
interest you pay on the loan and escrow payments (such as insurance or property 
tax) that you make. If you’re planning to use Loan Manager to track your loan, make 
sure you have all of your loan-tracking elements in place before you start using it. 
Here are the things you need:
• Liability account. Create a liability account (page 56) to track the money you’ve 
borrowed. For mortgages and other loans whose terms are longer than a year, 
use the Long Term Liability account type. For short-term loans (ones with terms 
of one year or less), use the Other Current Liability account type.
When you create the liability account, don’t enter an opening balance. The best 
way to record money you borrow is by recording a deposit (page 370) for the 
money you borrowed into the account where you deposited the money. (In the 
From Account cell, choose the liability account for the loan.) You can also record 

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
403
MANAGING 
LOANS
a loan’s opening balance with a journal entry (see Chapter 16), which credits 
the liability account for the loan and debits either the bank account where you 
deposited the money or the fixed asset account for the asset you purchased.
 TIP 	 If you’ve just started using QuickBooks and have a loan that you’ve partially paid off, fill in the journal 
entry with what you owed on the loan statement that’s dated just before your QuickBooks company file’s start 
date. Then enter any loan payments you’ve made since that statement’s ending date to get the account to the 
current balance.
• Loan interest account. The interest that you pay on loans is an expense, so 
create an Expense account (or an Other Expense account, if that’s the type of 
account your company uses for interest paid) called something like Interest 
Paid. (Loan Manager shows Other Expense accounts in its account drop-down 
lists, although it lists accounts in alphabetical order, not by type.)
• Escrow account. If you make escrow payments for things like property taxes and 
insurance, create an account to track the escrow you’ve paid. Because escrow 
represents money you’ve paid in advance, use the Current Asset account type.
• Fees and finance charge expense account. Chances are you’ll pay some sort of 
fee or finance charge at some point before you pay off the loan. If you don’t have 
an account for finance charges you pay, set up an Expense account for them.
• The lender in your Vendor List (page 84). You also need a vendor record for the 
institution that lent you the money, so you can use it for the payments you make.
The box below tells you what to do if you forgot to perform any of these steps before 
starting Loan Manager.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Where Are My Accounts and Vendors?
Loan Manager looks just like any other item in QuickBooks’ 
Banking menu, but it’s actually a separate small program. 
When you start Loan Manager, it gleans information from 
your company file, such as the liability account you created 
for the loan and the vendor record you set up for your lender.
If you forgot to create accounts or your lender in QuickBooks 
before launching Loan Manager, you’ll probably jump to your 
Chart of Accounts window or Vendor List and create them. 
Although you can create the elements you need by doing that, 
you still won’t see them in Loan Manager’s drop-down lists 
because Loan Manager only grabs the info it needs from your 
company file when you first launch it. To get them to appear, 
you have to close Loan Manager (and, unfortunately, lose any 
data you’ve already entered there), and then create those 
entries in QuickBooks. After you’ve created the vendor and 
all the accounts you need, choose Banking→Loan Manager 
to restart Loan Manager, which now includes your lender and 
loan accounts in its drop-down lists.
Adding a Loan to Loan Manager
Loan Manager makes it so easy to track and make payments on amortized loans 
that it’s well worth the steps required to set it up. Before you begin, gather your 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
404
MANAGING 
LOANS
loan documents like chicks to a mother hen, because Loan Manager wants to know 
every detail of your loan, as you’ll soon see.
BASIC SETUP
Once you’ve created the necessary accounts and vendor records (see the box on 
page 403), follow these steps to tell Loan Manager about your loan:
1.	 Choose Banking→Loan Manager.
QuickBooks opens the Loan Manager window.
2.	 In the Loan Manager window, click the “Add a Loan” button.
Loan Manager opens the Add Loan dialog box, which has several screens for 
the details of your loan. They’re all described in this section.
3.	 In the Account Name drop-down list, choose the liability account you cre­
ated for the loan.
Loan Manager lists only Current Liability and Long Term Liability accounts. Once 
you choose an account, Loan Manager displays the account’s current balance.
 NOTE 	 If Loan Manager shows the loan’s balance as zero, you aren’t off the hook for paying back the loan. 
Loan Manager grabs this balance from the QuickBooks liability account you created for the loan. The loan balance 
in Loan Manager is zero if you forgot to set the liability account’s opening balance. To correct this, click the Add 
Loan dialog box’s Cancel button, and then close Loan Manager. In QuickBooks, create a deposit or journal entry 
to set the liability account’s opening balance, and then restart Loan Manager and set up the loan.
4.	 In the Lender drop-down list, choose the vendor you created for the com­
pany you’re borrowing money from.
If you haven’t set up the lender as a vendor in QuickBooks, you have to close 
Loan Manager. After you create the vendor in QuickBooks, restart Loan Manager, 
which now includes the lender in its Lender drop-down list.
5.	 In the Origination Date box, choose the origination date on your loan 
documents.
Loan Manager uses this date to calculate the number of payments remaining, 
the interest you owe, and when you’ll pay off the loan.
6.	 In the Original Amount box, type the total amount you borrowed when you 
first took out the loan.
The Original Amount box is aptly named because it’s always the amount that 
you originally borrowed. For new loans, the current balance on the loan and 
the Original Amount are the same. If you’ve paid off a portion of a loan, your 
current balance (shown below the Account Name box in Figure 14-13) is lower 
than the Original Amount. If the current balance is zero, you forgot to record 
the money you borrowed in the liability account (page 402).

LOANS
7.	 In the Term boxes, specify the full length of the loan (such as 360 months 
or 30 years) and then click Next to advance to the screen where you enter 
payment information (explained next).
FIGURE 14-13
Loan Manager automatically selects 
Months in the Term drop-down list. 
Specifying the number of months for a 
30-year loan is a great refresher for your 
multiplication tables, but you don’t want 
to confuse Loan Manager by making an 
arithmetic error. 
If your loan’s term is measured in some-
thing other than months, in the Term 
drop-down list, choose the appropriate 
period (such as Years). Then you can fill in 
the Term box with the number of periods 
shown on your loan documents.
PAYMENT INFORMATION
When you specify a few details about your loan payments, Loan Manager can calcu­
late a payment schedule for you. And to make sure you don’t forget a loan payment 
(and incur outrageous late fees), you can tell Loan Manager to create a QuickBooks 
reminder for your payments. Here’s how:
1.	 In the “Due Date of Next Payment” box, choose the next payment date.
For a new loan, choose the date of the first payment you’ll make. For an exist­
ing loan, choose the next payment date, which usually appears on your most 
recent loan statement.
2.	 In the Payment Amount box, type the total amount of your next payment, 
including principal and interest.
Your payment amount is listed on your loan documents. Loan Manager auto­
matically puts 1 in the Next Payment Number box. For loans that you’ve made 
payments on already, replace this with the number of the next payment (this, 
too, should be on your most recent loan statement).
3.	 In the Payment Period drop-down list, choose the frequency of your 
payments.
Loans typically require monthly payments, even when their terms are in years, so 
Loan Manager automatically selects Monthly here. If your loan requires a different 
payment schedule, select the appropriate time period from this drop-down list.

MANAGING 
LOANS
4.	 If your loan includes an escrow payment, choose the Yes option, and then 
specify the amount of escrow you pay each time and the account to which 
you want to post the escrow, as shown in Figure 14-14.
FIGURE 14-14
Most mortgages include an escrow 
payment for property taxes and property 
insurance. (Escrow accounts are asset ac-
counts because you’re setting aside some 
money to pay expenses later.) 
When you add an escrow payment, Loan 
Manager updates the Total Payment value 
here to include principal, interest, and 
escrow.
5.	 If you want a reminder before a loan payment is due, leave the “Alert me 10 
days before a payment is due” checkbox turned on.
Loan Manager then tells QuickBooks when and how often payments are due, 
so QuickBooks can create a loan-payment reminder in its Reminders List (page 
483). You can’t change the number of days before a payment is due for the 
reminder, but 10 days is usually enough to get your payment in on time.
6.	 Click Next to advance to the screen for entering interest rate info (explained 
next).
INTEREST RATE INFORMATION
For Loan Manager to calculate your amortization schedule (the amount of principal 
and interest included with each payment), you have to specify the loan’s interest 
rate. Here’s how:
1.	 In the Interest Rate box, type the loan’s interest rate.
Use the rate that appears on your loan documents.
2.	 In the Compounding Period box, choose either Monthly or Exact Days, de­
pending on how the lender calculates compounding interest.
If the lender calculates the interest on your loan once a month, choose Monthly.
If the lender calculates interest using the annual interest rate divided over a 
fixed number of days in a year, choose Exact Days instead. When you do that, 

Chapter 14: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards
407
MANAGING 
LOANS
Loan Manager activates the Compute Period box. In the past, many lenders 
simplified calculations by assuming that a year had 12 months of 30 days each; 
if your lender uses this method, choose 365/360 as the Compute Period. Today, 
lenders often use the number of days in a year; in that case, choose the 365/365 
Compute Period option instead.
3.	 In the Payment Account drop-down list, choose the account from which 
you make loan payments.
Loan Manager includes all your bank accounts in this list.
4.	 In the Interest Expense Account drop-down list, choose the account you use 
to track interest you pay. In the Fees/Charges Expense Account drop-down 
list, choose the account you use for fees and late charges you pay.
Expense accounts and Other Expense accounts are comingled in these lists 
because they appear in alphabetical order, not sorted by type.
5.	 Click Finish.
Loan Manager calculates the loan’s payment schedule and adds it to its list of 
loans (Figure 14-15).
FIGURE 14-15
When you select a loan in 
the Loan List table here, 
the tabs at the bottom 
of the window display 
information about that 
loan. Most of the info on 
the Summary tab is stuff 
you entered, although 
Loan Manager calculates 
the maturity date (the 
date when you’ll pay off 
the loan). The Payment 
Schedule tab (shown here) 
lists every payment and 
the amount of principal 
and interest each one 
represents. The info on 
the Contact Info tab comes 
from the lender’s vendor 
record in QuickBooks.
Modifying Loan Terms
Some loan characteristics change from time to time. For example, if you have an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate changes every so often. And your escrow 
payment changes based on your property taxes and insurance premiums. To make 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

LOANS
changes like these, in the Loan Manager window (choose Banking→Loan Manager), 
select the loan, and then click Edit Loan Details.
Loan Manager takes you through the same series of screens you saw when you first 
added the loan (page 404). If you change the interest rate, the program recalculates 
your payment schedule. If you make a change in escrow, the program updates your 
payment to include the new escrow amount.
Setting Up Payments
You can set up a loan-payment check or bill in Loan Manager, which hands off the 
payment info to QuickBooks so the program can record it in your company file. 
Although Loan Manager can handle this task one payment at a time, it can’t create 
recurring payments to send the payment that’s due each month. When you see 
the QuickBooks reminder for your loan payment, you have to run Loan Manager to 
generate the payment, like so:
1.	 In the Loan Manager window (Banking→Loan Manager), select the loan you 
want to pay, and then click Set Up Payment.
Loan Manager opens the Set Up Payment dialog box and fills in the information 
for the next payment, as shown in Figure 14-16.
FIGURE 14-16
When you click Set Up Pay-
ment, Loan Manager fills in 
the Payment Information 
section of this dialog box 
with the principal and 
interest amounts from the 
loan payment schedule 
for the next payment 
that’s due. 
It also fills in the Payment 
Number box with the 
number of the next pay-
ment due.

409
MANAGING 
LOANS
 NOTE 	 To make an extra payment, in the “This payment is” drop-down list, choose “An extra payment.” 
Because extra payments aren’t part of the loan’s payment schedule, Loan Manager changes the values in the 
Principal (P), Interest (I), Fees & Charges, and Escrow boxes to zero. If you want to prepay principal on your loan, 
type the amount that you want to prepay in the Principal (P) box. Or, to pay an annual fee, fill in the Fees & 
Charges box.
2.	 In the “I want to” drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box, choose 
“Write a check” or “Enter a bill,” and then click OK.
Loan Manager opens QuickBooks’ Write Checks or Enter Bills window, respec­
tively, and fills in the boxes with the payment information. If you want, you can 
change the payment date or other values.
3.	 In the Write Checks or Enter Bills window, click Save & Close.
The window closes and you’re back in the Loan Manager window, where the 
value in the loan’s Balance cell has been reduced by the amount of principal 
that the payment paid off.
If you want to print the payment schedule for your loan, in the Loan Manager win­
dow, select it in the Loan List, and then click Print. If you pay off a loan and want 
to remove it from Loan Manager, select the loan, and then click Remove Loan. 
(Removing a loan from Loan Manager doesn’t delete any loan transactions or loan 
accounts in QuickBooks.)
 NOTE 	 If your loan payments include escrow, each payment deposits the escrow amount into your QuickBooks 
escrow asset account. When your loan statement shows that the lender paid expenses from escrow—like insurance 
or property taxes—you can record the corresponding payment in QuickBooks: Open the escrow account’s register 
window (page 374) and, in the first blank transaction row, choose the date and the payee, such as the insurance 
company or the tax agency. In the Decrease field, type the payment amount (because the payment reduces the 
balance in the escrow account), and then click Record.

What-If Scenarios
Because economic conditions and interest rates change, 
loans aren’t necessarily stable. For example, if you have an 
adjustable-rate loan, you might want to know what your new 
payment amount is. Or you might want to find out whether it 
makes sense to refinance an existing loan when interest rates 
drop. Loan Manager’s what-if feature is your dry-erase board 
for trying out loan changes before you make up your mind. 
When you click the What If Scenarios button, Loan Manager 
opens the What If Scenarios dialog box, where you can pick 
from different scenarios depending on whether you’ve already 
created a loan:
• How much will I pay with a new loan? You don’t have to 
go through the third degree to see what a loan will cost. 
Choose this scenario, and then enter the requested info 
to evaluate the payment amounts, number of payments, 
total interest, and final balloon payment.
• Evaluate two new loans. Type in the details of two loans 
to see which one is better.
• What if I change my payment amount? This scenario 
is listed only if you’ve already created a loan in Loan 
Manager. Paying extra principal can shorten the length 
of your loan and reduce the total interest you pay. Choose 
this scenario and then, in the Payment Amount box, type 
the new amount you plan to pay each month. When you 
click Calculate, Loan Manager calculates your new maturity 
date, how much you’ll pay overall, and how much you’ll 
pay in interest.
• What if I change my interest rate? If you have an 
adjustable-rate loan set up in Loan Manager, choose this 
scenario to preview the changes in payment, interest, and 
balloon payment for a different rate (higher or lower).
• What if I refinance my loan? This scenario is listed only 
if you’ve already created a loan in Loan Manager. When 
interest rates drop, companies and individuals alike 
consider refinancing their debt to save money on interest. 
With this scenario, you type in a new term, payment, 
interest rate, and payment date to see whether it’s worth 
refinancing.
The changes you make in the What If Scenarios dialog box don’t 
change your existing loans. And if you switch to a different 
scenario or close the dialog box, Loan Manager doesn’t save the 
information you’ve entered. So if you want a record of different 
scenarios, click Print after you enter the info for each one.

hen you first start your business, you may be the proud owner of every 
job title in your company: receptionist, sales rep, technician, bookkeeper, 
janitor, and CEO. But if your company is like most, you’ll eventually hire 
people to help you with all those tasks.
Unless you run an all-volunteer operation, sooner or later, your employees are going 
to want to get paid. When that time comes, you face the daunting task of dealing 
with payroll, which is the name for all the financial records you have to keep for 
employees’ salaries, wages, bonuses, withholdings, and deductions. If you decide 
to process payroll in QuickBooks, you should sign up for one of the payroll services 
that Intuit offers. To keep expenses low, you can choose a bare-bones service that 
provides only updated tax tables. At the other end of the spectrum, you can opt 
for Intuit’s full-service payroll. Or you can compromise somewhere in the middle.
After you choose a payroll service, your next task is to set up everything QuickBooks 
needs to calculate payroll amounts. You can walk through each step on your own 
or use an interview feature built into QuickBooks. (If you opt for Intuit’s full-service 
payroll [page 417], they do some of this setup for you.) Either way, the Payroll Setup 
interview keeps track of what you’ve done and what you still have to do. 
 NOTE 	 Intuit sometimes updates its payroll services between QuickBooks editions. That way, you get the latest 
tax tables, compliance information, bug fixes, and enhancements right away. So to keep this book’s instructions 
about Intuit payroll services up to date, they’re not actually in the book. Instead, you can read them in online 
Appendix D, which is available from this book’s Missing CD page at www.missing manuals.com/cds. (Appendix D 
covers Intuit’s desktop payroll service, not its online payroll service.)

GETTING 
STARTED WITH 
PAYROLL
Another option is to outsource the headaches of payroll to a payroll-service com­
pany other than Intuit. If you go that route, then you simply use values from the 
payroll-service company’s reports to create a couple of transactions in QuickBooks 
for each payroll—to allocate salaries and wages, payroll taxes, and any other payroll 
expenses to the accounts in your chart of accounts. This chapter explains how to 
record these payroll transactions.
If you run a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a small Sub-chapter S corporation, 
you can withdraw money from the company as compensation without fussing 
over payroll. But to take advantage of retirement savings options like a Simplified 
Employee Pension (SEP), you have to deal with special rules regarding eligible com­
pensation. For sole proprietors and partners, all you have to do to determine your 
eligibility for a SEP is calculate your compensation, which is based on company net 
profits. However, a Subchapter S corporation has to pay you an actual salary for you 
to be eligible for a SEP plan. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to record do-it-yourself 
payroll transactions, and how to pay yourself without payroll.
Getting Started with Payroll
Shortly after you hire employees, you need to write their first paychecks, so setting 
up payroll can’t wait until employees are onboard. If you’re already running payroll 
with a payroll service, you probably have the info you need to set up QuickBooks’ 
payroll features. In that case, skip to page 415 to learn what Intuit’s payroll services 
have to offer. But if you’re new to payroll, read on to learn about the tax agency 
items you need and the payroll decisions you have to make before you hire anyone.
What You Need from the Government
Part of the payroll process includes withholding taxes from employees’ paychecks 
and sending that money (along with your company’s payroll taxes) to the appropriate 
government agencies. Before you can do that, you need to get on the government’s 
radar. As you already know, anything tax-related spells paperwork, and payroll is no 
exception. Here are the IDs, accounts, and forms you need for payroll:
• Employer Identification Number (EIN). If you’re a sole proprietor, your Social 
Security number acts as your business identification number when you fill out 
your tax return. For any other type of company, you need an EIN. If you don’t 
have one yet, you can apply for one online. Go to www.irs.gov and search for 
“Apply online EIN.”
• An Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) account. The IRS requires 
that all federal taxes be paid electronically via EFTPS. (The box on page 413 
briefly describes the various payroll-related federal taxes you have to pay.) To 
sign up for EFTPS, head to www.eftps.gov/eftps and click the Enroll button. Sign 
up using your federal EIN (see the previous bullet point). After the IRS processes 
your enrollment, it mails you a four-digit PIN. Once you have that, back you go to 
the EFTPS website to log in again and use the PIN to create a password. That’s 

Chapter 15: Doing Payroll

it! You’re now ready to pay your taxes electronically. When it’s time to remit 
taxes, you log into the EFTPS website, select the tax period and payment date, 
and fill in the amount. (If you subscribe to Intuit’s Enhanced Payroll service, 
you can use the E-File & Pay feature to log into the EFTPS website. That way, 
QuickBooks makes the payment and records the transaction. You can also tell 
QuickBooks to remember your EFTPS login credentials so you don’t have to 
re-enter them each time.)
• A state payroll account. Each state is different. To learn about the IDs and forms 
that each state requires and the agencies that require them, head to payroll.
intuit.com/support/compliance. You can also call your state’s Department of 
Revenue to find out what you need to do.
Once you have your EIN and payroll tax accounts set up, you’re ready to report and 
pay payroll taxes. Now all you need are some employees.
UP TO SPEED
Federal Taxes, Taxes, and More Taxes
As an employer, you have to handle two types of payroll taxes: 
the ones that your employees have to pay and those that your 
company pays. Payroll withholdings get their name because 
you withhold those taxes from your employees’ paychecks. 
But the money you withhold isn’t yours to keep: You have to 
send it to the IRS, the Social Security Administration, and, in 
some cases, your state. In addition, your company has to pay 
employer payroll taxes.
Here are the federal taxes you have to deal with:
• Federal income tax. You withhold this tax from employees’ 
paychecks each pay period. The withholding amount is 
based on the info on the W-4 form each employee fills out. 
How often you remit taxes depends on the amount of with-
holdings you owe the federal government (the remittance 
schedule starts monthly and is due the 15th of the follow-
ing month). You report these taxes on Form 941 (www.
irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f941.pdf), which is due quarterly. 
• Employee portion of Social Security and Medicare. 
Employees pay half the tab for these two taxes (6.2% 
for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare; high earners 
pay an additional Medicare tax of 0.9% for wages greater 
than $200,000). Report Social Security and Medicare 
withholdings on Form 941 and remit them on the same 
schedule as your federal income tax.
• Employer portion of Social Security and Medicare. As an 
employer, you pay the other half of the tab for these 
taxes. (You report and remit them at the same time as 
the employee portion.)
• Federal Unemployment (FUTA). This unemployment tax is 
another employer expense, so you don’t withhold it from 
your employees’ paychecks. This tax is 6 percent of wages 
up to $7,000 and is due in the quarter your liability reaches 
$500.00. You report it on Form 940 (www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/f940.pdf), which is due in January of each year.
Employee-Related Forms You Need
Hiring employees launches the paperwork journey. Here are the forms prospective 
employees have to fill out (and keep on file):
• W-4. Each employee fills out one of these forms to specify his withholding al­
lowance, such as single, married, and number of dependents. If employees want 
additional taxes withheld, they can write in the amount. If they want to change

GETTING 
STARTED WITH 
PAYROLL
their withholdings, they simply fill in a new copy of the form. After you’ve ac­
tivated an Intuit Payroll service, you can get a copy of this form in QuickBooks 
by choosing Employees→Employee Forms. You can also download this form 
from www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf.
• I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification). Once you make a job offer to a 
prospective employee, that person has to fill out this form so you can verify 
her identity and employment authorization. Although you don’t have to sub­
mit this form to any agency, you need to keep it on file in case a government 
representative asks for it. (Not having it may cost you a fine.) Your employee 
fills in basic info like name, address, Social Security number, birthdate, and so 
on. The form lists documents that are acceptable forms of identification, such 
as a driver’s license or Social Security card. After you check your employee’s 
document and say “Yup, that’s you!” you’re done. After you’ve activated an 
Intuit Payroll service, you can get a copy of this form in QuickBooks by choos­
ing Employees→Employee Forms. To download this form, head to www.uscis.
gov/files/form/i-9.pdf.
 TIP 	 Don’t file an employee’s I-9 form in that person’s personnel folder. Doing so can lead to legal issues if 
the employee’s personnel file is subpoenaed in an employment lawsuit.
• State withholding forms. Many states simply use the withholding allowances 
from employees’ W-4 forms as the state withholding allowance, whereas 
some require their own forms. If you live in Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South 
Dakota, Texas, or Washington, you’re in luck: You don’t have to withhold state 
income taxes. To learn about state forms, head to payroll.intuit.com/support/
compliance.
 TIP 	 To make sure that you get all the necessary paperwork from employees, create a new-hire packet that 
contains the W-4, I-9, any state forms, and a copy of your company’s policies. That way, you can hand packets to 
new employees and get all the filled-in forms back before they begin work.
Payroll Decisions You Need to Make
Before you can set up your payroll service, you need to make a few payroll-related 
decisions:
• How much? You need to decide the salary or wages you’ll pay for each posi­
tion, as well as other monetary aspects of positions, like benefits, overtime, 
commissions, and bonuses. One way to figure out how much to offer workers 
is to research what other employers in your area are paying and the benefits 
they offer for similar positions.
• How often? Your employees rely on receiving their paychecks on a regular 
schedule, such as every other week or twice a month. Payroll frequency is up 
to you. However, once you choose a schedule, you have to stick to it.

GEM IN THE ROUGH
Who Is an Employee?
Some employers think they can avoid the hassle of payroll by 
paying people as subcontractors instead. No such luck. Strict 
requirements determine who is and isn’t an employee—and 
you’ll pay severe penalties if you’re caught trying to beat 
the system.
The IRS has rules for determining employment status of people 
providing services to your business. If you answer yes to the 
following questions, the worker is probably an employee:
• Behavioral. Does your company control or have the right 
to control what the worker does and how she does her job?
• Financial. Do you control the business aspects of the 
worker’s job, such as how the worker is paid and whether 
his expenses are reimbursed? And do you provide the 
tools and equipment used on the job?
• Type of relationship. Do you have a written contract with 
the worker? Do you provide her with benefits, such as 
health insurance, vacation pay, and a pension? Will the 
relationship continue? Is the work performed a key aspect 
of your business?
For more info on employees versus independent contrac-
tors, head to www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762.html. If you still 
aren’t sure how to classify someone, ask your accountant or 
tax advisor. Another option is to fill out form SS-8 (www.irs.
gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss8.pdf) and submit it to the IRS. The IRS 
then notifies you whether the person is an employee or an 
independent contractor.
Keep in mind that a signed contract designating someone as an 
independent contractor doesn’t make it so if the person should 
be an employee instead. You can’t enforce an illegal contract.
• Pay period end date and paycheck date. The pay period end date is the day 
through which you pay people for the hours they work, and the paycheck date 
is, of course, the day you actually pay employees. For example, the paychecks 
you hand out could pay employees for hours worked through Sunday, but you 
don’t pay your employees for those hours until the following Friday. Make sure 
to allow enough time between the payroll cutoff date and payday to process 
payroll. In addition, if you use QuickBooks Direct Deposit (page 417), it takes 
two days after you submit direct deposit requests for those funds to be avail­
able in employees’ accounts. If you’re using Intuit’s Assisted Payroll service in 
the desktop version of QuickBooks, you have to submit your payroll and direct 
deposits requests by 5 p.m. two business days before payday (not including 
federal bank holidays).
Intuit Payroll Services
Payroll involves all sorts of important details, but fortunately you don’t have to re­
member them all. Intuit offers several payroll services that handle the nitty-gritty: 
After you set up your Payroll items and employees, you simply fill out the hours 
your employees work each pay period, and the payroll service calculates paychecks, 
withholdings, and your employer payroll tax liability (how much your company

SERVICES
owes). After that, all you have to do is get the money to the right places—and payroll 
services make that easy, too.
Intuit offers three levels of payroll service: a do-it-yourself version, a more helpful 
option that pitches in with the majority of payroll tasks, and a full-service option 
that takes care of everything except filling in the hours your employees work. You 
can sign up for either a desktop or online version of any of these service levels. This 
section describes what each option offers.
With an online Intuit payroll service, you don’t have to be in the office on payday, 
and you don’t even have to run QuickBooks. These services are available 24/7, and 
you can access them from anywhere with an Internet connection. You could be on 
vacation and still pay your employees on time by running payroll from your laptop, 
iPad, iPhone, or Android device. Intuit’s online payroll services integrate with Quick­
Books, so you can download your payroll info and import it into your QuickBooks 
company file. (To see the most current features and pricing, head to http://payroll.
intuit.com/payroll_services/online_payroll.jsp.)
 NOTE 	 Time Tracking is an additional service that Intuit Online Payroll offers. Employees can log in and 
enter their hours, either by clocking in and out or by filling in a timesheet on a password-protected website. In 
addition, this service sends emails to remind your employees of time reporting deadlines. You then review their 
hours and either edit or approve them. This feature can keep you compliant with overtime rules, too.
If you use one of Intuit’s desktop payroll services, you prepare payroll from within 
QuickBooks, so the data is automatically recorded in your company file.
 NOTE 	 Intuit payroll services charge by the month, not for each pay period, as many other services do. You 
pay the same fee whether you run payroll weekly, every two weeks, or bimonthly.
Here’s what each payroll service level offers (though keep in mind that the features 
listed here could change after this book is published):
• Basic Payroll is a do-it-yourself option. You set everything up at the start. Then, 
for each payroll, you enter hours or payroll amounts, and QuickBooks uses tax 
tables to calculate payroll taxes and deductions for you. This service then spits 
out reports with the info you need to fill out the federal and state tax forms you 
have to file. Your job is to print the paychecks from QuickBooks (or use direct 
deposit), make tax deposits, and file your payroll tax forms.
 TIP 	 Intuit payroll services offer free phone, chat, and email support to help you get set up. So if you have 
any questions on how to do things, all you have to do is ask.

SERVICE
• Enhanced Payroll (the most popular) can handle preparing federal and state 
payroll forms. It provides up-to-date tax forms, fills in most of the tax-form 
info, and lets you make your tax deposits and file your tax forms electronically 
from within QuickBooks. This service sends you emails to remind you when 
payroll, forms, and payroll taxes are due, and to tell you when payroll is direct 
deposited, taxes have been paid, and tax authorities have accepted your tax 
forms. In QuickBooks, the Payroll Center reminds you when payroll and payroll 
taxes are due, and shows the status of direct deposit payments, electronic 
tax payments, and tax forms that you submitted through QuickBooks. It also 
archives your tax forms on your desktop as PDFs and displays a table of your 
most recently archived forms.
• Full Service Payroll does it all. If you opt for this service, Intuit sets up payroll 
for you. (If you used another payroll service in the past, it transfers that data into 
Intuit payroll.) You don’t have to make federal and state payroll tax deposits, 
file required tax reports during the year, or prepare W-2 and W-3 forms at the 
end of the year—the service handles all these tasks for you. In addition, Intuit 
guarantees that your payroll and payroll tax deposits and filings will be accurate 
and on time. Of course, you have to send Intuit the correct data on time in the 
first place. But if this service then makes a mistake or misses a deadline, Intuit 
pays the resulting payroll tax penalties.
Recording Transactions from a Payroll 
Service
Lots of companies use outside payroll services (ADP and Paychex are two popular 
ones) to avoid the brain strain of figuring out tax deductions and complying with 
payroll regulations. When you use one of these services, you send it your payroll 
data. It then writes and distributes your company’s payroll checks and sends you 
reports about the transactions it processed. It even takes care of remitting payroll 
taxes and other withholdings to the appropriate agencies.
None of these payroll transactions appear in your QuickBooks company file until 
you add them. Fortunately, you don’t have to enter every last detail. You can simply 
create a journal entry debiting the payroll expense accounts and crediting your bank 
account (page 426). Or you can create a vendor for payroll and record a split trans­
action that distributes the money from your checking account into the appropriate 
expense accounts, as shown in Figure 15-1; here’s how:
1.	 Create a vendor for your payroll transactions.
On the QuickBooks Home Page, click the Vendors button. In the Vendor Center’s 
toolbar, click New Vendor→New Vendor. You don’t have to fill in all the fields 
in the New Vendor window; simply type something like Payroll Service in the 
Vendor Name box, and then click OK.

In most cases, your payroll 
falls into three categories: 
Officers salaries represent 
gross salaries for corporate 
officers. Salaries, as shown 
here (sometimes called 
“Salaries and wages”), 
represent the gross pay 
that employees receive 
on their paychecks. And 
payroll taxes are the 
employer payroll taxes 
that the company pays, 
such as Social Security and 
Medicare taxes.
 NOTE 	 The example in Figure 15-1 and the instructions in this numbered list apply when your employees 
are paid using direct deposit, where the money is deposited into their bank accounts electronically. If you don’t use 
direct deposit, you also have to record the actual paychecks in QuickBooks (as explained in online Appendix D) in 
order to reconcile your bank account.
2.	 Press Ctrl+W or choose Banking→Write Checks.
In the Write Checks window’s Bank Account drop-down list, choose the account 
you use for your payroll.
3.	 In the No. field, type EFT for “electronic funds transfer.”
Most payroll services transfer the funds from your bank account electronically.
4.	 In the Pay To The Order Of field, type the name of the payroll vendor you 
just set up.

5.	 If necessary, on the window’s Expenses tab, fill in the Account and Amount 
fields for each payroll expense, as shown in Figure 15-1.
If the accounts are already in place but the values differ, simply edit the numbers 
in the Amount fields.
 NOTE 	 To record the payroll service’s fee, record a separate transaction in the payroll bank account, using 
another vendor you create, such as Payroll Service Fees. Assign the transaction to an expense account named 
something like Payroll Service Fees.
6.	 When the transaction is correct, click Save & Close.
 TIP 	 If you turned on the preference to recall the last transaction (page 650), QuickBooks automatically fills 
in the amounts and accounts the next time you record a transaction for the payroll service.
Paying Yourself
If you own a sole proprietorship, partnership, or Subchapter S corporation (named 
after Subchapter S of the U.S. tax code), you can take money out of the company 
for your personal use. These withdrawals go by different names depending on the 
type of company. For a sole proprietor, the money you withdraw is called owner’s 
draw, or simply draw. Partners withdraw money and call it partners’ draw. And if 
you’re a shareholder in a Subchapter S corporation, the money you withdraw is 
called a shareholders’ distribution.
If you don’t pay yourself a salary, you pay taxes when the company’s profits flow 
through to your personal tax return. However, if you’re a Subchapter S shareholder, 
you can pay yourself using a combination of salary and shareholders’ distribution. 
That way, you can contribute to a pension plan, like a SEP, based on your corporate 
salary. 
This section explains how to pay yourself (and other partners and shareholders) no 
matter which type of business structure you’ve established.
Taking a Draw
As your company makes money, you can withdraw funds. The easiest way to do this 
in QuickBooks is to write a check (page 202) made out to you, as shown in Figure 
15-2. If you’re a sole proprietor and own your own company, choosing the Owner’s 
Contribution/Draw account for the check tells QuickBooks to post the check to 
show that you’ve withdrawn equity from your company. You use the same process 
if you’re a partner except that you choose the Partners’ Contribution/Draw account 
instead. The Shareholders’ Distribution account shown in Figure 15-2 represents the 
draw account for shareholders in a Subchapter S corporation.

FIGURE 15-2
In the Write Checks win-
dow, on the Expenses tab, 
choose the draw account 
in the first blank Account 
cell, as shown here. 
When you save the check, 
QuickBooks debits that 
equity account, which 
decreases its balance.
 NOTE 	 If you’re a sole proprietor, you typically make an initial investment of capital into your business. 
You record this investment into the Owner’s Contribution/Draw equity account as explained on page 434. If your 
company runs low on cash later on, you can contribute more money and record this addition in the same account.
Reclassifying Shareholders’ Distribution to Salary
If shareholders withdraw money from a Subchapter S corporation for personal use, 
you may want to turn some of that shareholders’ distribution into salary so, for 
example, the partners can qualify to contribute to a retirement account. To prepare 
payroll in this situation, you have to calculate the applicable payroll withholdings 
(like federal and state taxes, Social Security, and Medicare) and company payroll 
taxes. (Alternatively, you can ask your accountant or bookkeeper to calculate them 
for you.) You also have to record payroll checks (if you issue them) and checks that 
you send to federal and state tax agencies for withholdings and payroll taxes, as 
shown in Figure 15-3. And don’t forget about preparing and filing federal and state 
payroll tax returns, including forms W-2 and W-3.
If partners take shareholders’ distributions, you can use a journal entry to recategorize 
some of those dollars as salary. For example, you could assign the money to a salary 
expense account called Officers Salaries, as shown in Figure 15-4. (You’ll learn about

FIGURE 15-3
If you pay shareholders’ 
salaries in a Subchapter 
S corporation, the payroll 
taxes you remit to the IRS are 
split between two different 
accounts, as shown here: a li-

partners’, or shareholders’ 
payroll withholdings (here, 
that’s Payroll Tax Payable) 
and an expense account for 
the employer payroll taxes 
(Taxes-Payroll).

its balance (which de-
creased when you took the 
distribution), whereas the 
debit to the salary expense 
account shows your salary 
as an expense. The Payroll 
Tax Payable amount 
represents your employee 
portion of payroll tax 
withholdings.

RECLASSIFYING PAYROLL WITHHOLDINGS
After you reclassify shareholders’ distributions as salary, you still have to account 
for your payroll withholdings (such as the federal and state income taxes you pay) 
and other payroll taxes. When you remit payroll taxes to tax agencies like the IRS, 
you have to allocate them to the correct payroll accounts in your company file.
The journal entry in Figure 15-4 set your salary to $80,000. However, companies 
and employees split the bill for Social Security taxes and Medicare taxes. Because 
employees don’t know anything about remitting payroll tax withholdings, they let 
their employers include those withholdings in the employer’s payroll tax payments. 
The credit to the Payroll Tax Payable account in Figure 15-4 allocates part of the 
salaries paid to employee payroll tax withholdings so it appears in the Payroll Tax 
Payable current liability account.
When you remit payroll taxes, the amount you pay includes both the employer 
payroll taxes and employees’ payroll tax withholdings. That’s why the IRS check in 
Figure 15-3 is split between two accounts. The line assigned to the Taxes-Payroll 
account represents the employer portion of federal payroll taxes (which includes 
the employer’s portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the employer’s 
federal unemployment tax). The line for Payroll Tax Payable, on the other hand, 
represents the employees’ payroll tax withholdings (estimated federal income tax 
and the employees’ portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes).

CHAPTER

M
ost of the time, you don’t need to know double-entry accounting (page xxi) 
to use QuickBooks. When you write checks, receive payments, and perform 
many other tasks in QuickBooks, the program creates transactions that un­
obtrusively handle the double-entry accounting for you. But every once in a while, 
such transactions can’t help, and your only choice is moving money around directly 
between accounts.
In the accounting world, these direct manipulations are known as journal entries. For 
example, if you posted income to your only income account but have since decided 
that you need several income accounts to track the money you make, journal entries 
are the way to reclassify money in that original income account to the new ones.
 TIP 	 Although journal entries are the only solution for some tasks in QuickBooks, it’s best to use QuickBooks 
transactions instead whenever possible. By using transactions, your QuickBooks reports will contain all the info 
you expect, and you’ll have the details you need if the IRS starts asking questions.
The steps for creating a journal entry are deceptively easy; it’s assigning money to 
accounts in the correct way that’s maddeningly difficult for weekend accountants. 
And, unfortunately, QuickBooks doesn’t have any magic looking glass that makes 
these assignments crystal clear. This chapter gets you started by showing you how 
to create journal entries, and provides examples of journal entries you’re likely to 
need. However, you’ll want to talk to your bookkeeper or accountant about the 
specific journal entries you need and the accounts to use in them.

BALANCING 
DEBIT AND 
CREDIT 
AMOUNTS
 NOTE 	 In the accounting world, you’ll hear the term “journal entry” and see it abbreviated JE. However, 
QuickBooks uses the term “general journal entry” and the corresponding abbreviation GJE. Don’t worry: These 
terms and abbreviations are interchangeable.
Balancing Debit and Credit Amounts
In double-entry accounting, both sides of any transaction have to balance, as Figure 
16-1 shows. When you move money between accounts, you increase the balance in 
one account and decrease the balance in the other—just as shaking some money 
out of your piggy bank decreases your savings balance and increases the money 
in your pocket. These changes in value are called debits and credits. (Whether the 
debit and credit increase or decrease the account balance depends on the type of 
account, as Table 16-1 shows.) If you commit anything about accounting to memory, 
it should be the definitions of debist and credits, because they’re the key to creating 
successful journal entries, generating accurate financial reports, and understanding 
what your accountant is talking about.
FIGURE 16-1
For each transaction, the 
total in the Debit column 
has to equal the total in 
the Credit column. 
To transfer money from 
one income account to 
another, you debit one 
account and credit the 
other.
Table 16-1 shows what debits and credits do for different types of accounts and 
can take some of the pain out of creating journal entries. For example, buying a 
machine is a debit to the equipment asset account because it increases the value 
of the equipment (assets) you own. A loan payment is a debit to your loan account 
because it decreases your loan balance (a liability). And (here’s a real mind-bender) a 
credit card charge is a credit to your credit card liability account because purchases 
on credit increase the amount you owe.

 NOTE 	 One reason that debits and credits are confusing is that the words have the exact opposite meanings 
when your bank uses them. In your personal banking, a debit to your bank account decreases its balance, and a 
credit to that account increases its balance.
As you’ll see in examples in this chapter, you can have more than one debit or credit 
entry in one journal entry. For example, when you depreciate equipment, you can 
include a debit for the overall depreciation expense and a separate credit for the 
depreciation on each piece of equipment.
Some Reasons to Use Journal Entries
Here are a few of the more common reasons that businesses use journal entries:
• Setting up opening balances in accounts. You can fill in the opening balance 
for most of your balance sheet accounts with a single journal entry based on 
your trial balance from your previous accounting system. The box on page 429 
explains how.
• Reassigning accounts. As you work with QuickBooks, you might find that the 
accounts you originally created don’t track your business the way you want. 
For example, suppose you started with one income account for everything you 
sell—services and products alike. But now you want two income accounts: one 
for income from services and another for income from product sales. To move 
income from your original account to the correct new account, you debit the 
income from the original account and credit it to the new account, as described 
on page 431.
• Correcting account assignments. If you assigned an expense to the wrong ac­
count, you or your accountant can create a journal entry to reassign the expense 
to the correct account. If you’ve developed a reputation for misassigning income 
and expenses, your accountant might ask you to assign any transactions you’re 
unsure about to an uncategorized income or expense account. That way, when 
she gets your company file at the end of the year, she can create journal entries 
to assign those transactions correctly. You can verify that the assignments and 
account balances are correct by running a Trial Balance report (page 442).

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
426
CREATING 
JOURNAL 
ENTRIES
• Reassigning jobs. If a customer hires you for several jobs, that customer might 
ask you to apply a payment, credit, or expense from one job to another. For 
example, if expenses come after one job is complete, your customer might want 
to apply them to the job still in progress. QuickBooks doesn’t have a feature 
specifically for transferring money between jobs, but a journal entry does the 
trick, as page 432 explains.
• Reassigning classes. If you use QuickBooks’ class feature, journal entries can 
transfer income or expenses from one class to another. For example, nonprofits 
often use classes to assign income to programs. If you need to reassign money 
to a different program, create a journal entry that has debit and credit entries 
for the same income account but changes the class (see page 428).
• Depreciating assets. Each year that you own a depreciable asset, you decrease 
its value in the appropriate asset account in your chart of accounts. Because 
no real cash changes hands, you use a journal entry to handle depreciation. As 
you’ll learn on page 433, a journal entry for depreciation debits the depreciation 
expense account (increasing its value) and credits the asset account (decreas­
ing its value).
• Recording transactions for a payroll service. If you use a third-party pay­
roll service like Paychex or ADP, the payroll company sends you reports. You 
can then use journal entries to get the numbers from those reports into your 
company file where you need them. For example, you can reclassify some of 
your owner’s draw as salary and make other payroll-related transformations, 
as page 420 explains.
• Recording year-end transactions. The end of the year is a popular time for 
journal entries, whether your accountant is fixing your more creative transac­
tions or you’re creating journal entries for noncash transactions before you 
prepare your taxes. For example, if you run a small business out of your home, 
you might want to show a portion of your utility bills as expenses for your home 
office. When you create a journal entry for this transaction, you debit the office 
utilities account and credit an equity account for your owner’s contributions to 
the company.
Creating Journal Entries
In essence, every transaction you create in QuickBooks is a journal entry. For ex­
ample, when you write checks, the program balances the debits and credits behind 
the scenes. When you want to explicitly create journal entries in QuickBooks, you 
use the Make General Journal Entries window. Here are the basic steps:
1.	 Choose Company→Make General Journal Entries.
Or, if the Chart of Accounts window is open, right-click anywhere in the window, 
and then choose Make General Journal Entries on the shortcut menu, or click 
Activities→Make General Journal Entries.

Chapter 16: Making Journal Entries
427
CREATING 
JOURNAL 
ENTRIES
2.	 In the Make General Journal Entries window, choose the date you want as­
sociated with this journal entry.
If you’re creating a journal entry to reassign income or an expense to the cor­
rect account, use today’s date. However, when you or your accountant make 
end-of-year journal entries—to add the current year’s depreciation, say—it’s 
common to use the last day of the fiscal year instead.
 NOTE 	 If you turn on QuickBooks’ multiple currency preference (page 656), the Make General Journal Entries 
window includes boxes for the currency and the exchange rate. If you select an account that uses a foreign currency 
in a journal-entry line, QuickBooks fills in the exchange rate and asks you to confirm that the rate is correct. If it 
isn’t, open the Currency List (choose Lists→Currency List) and update the exchange rate for that currency.
3.	 If you want to change the number that QuickBooks automatically assigned to 
this journal entry, specify a different number by typing it in the Entry No. box.
Entry numbers can contain letters, numbers, and punctuation. If you type an 
entry number value that includes a number, then the next time you create a 
journal entry, QuickBooks fills in the Entry No. box by incrementing the one 
you typed. For example, suppose your accountant adds several journal entries 
at the end of the year and uses the numbers ACCT-1, ACCT-2, ACCT-3, and so 
on. When you begin using the file again, you can type a new value to restart 
your sequence, such as TRB-40 or 40TRB. When you create your next journal 
entry, QuickBooks automatically fills in the Entry No. box with TRB-41 or 41TRB, 
respectively.
 TIP 	 If you don’t want QuickBooks to number journal entries automatically, you can turn off this feature in 
the program’s Accounting preferences (page 636).
4.	 In the first Account cell, choose the account you want to debit or credit.
Every line of every journal entry has to have an account assigned. So once 
you enter values in this row, when you click the Account cell in the next row, 
QuickBooks automatically enters the offsetting balance, as shown in Figure 16-2.
5.	 If you want to debit the account you just selected, in the same row of the 
window’s table, type the amount in the Debit cell. To credit the account 
instead, type the amount in the Credit cell.
The first row of your journal entry can be either a debit or a credit. However, 
most accountants start journal entries with a debit.
6.	 Fill in the Memo cell with a brief description of the journal entry’s purpose.
Entering a memo is a huge help when you go back to review your journal entries. 
For example, if you’re reclassifying an uncategorized expense, type something 
like “Reclassify expense to correct account.” For depreciation, you can include 
the dates covered by the journal entry.

your first line is a credit, 
QuickBooks puts the same

choose Edit→Preferences→Accounting, and then click the My Preferences tab.
7.	 If you’re debiting or crediting an AR or AP account, choose an option in the 
Name cell, as explained in the box on page 429.
You also fill in this cell if you’re creating a journal entry for billable expenses and 
want to assign the expenses to a customer or job. When you choose a name 
in this cell, QuickBooks automatically puts a checkmark in the “Billable?” cell, 
as shown in Figure 16-2, which reassigns some of your existing expenses to be 
billable to the customer or job. If you don’t want to make the value billable to 
the customer (for example, to assign expenses to a customer’s job to reflect its 
true profitability), then click the checkmark to turn it off.
8.	 If you use classes, choose a class for each row to keep your class reports 
accurate.
If you’re creating a journal entry to reassign income or expenses to a different 
class, select the same account on each row but different classes.
9.	 Repeat steps 4–8 to fill in the second row of the journal entry.
If the offsetting value that QuickBooks adds to the second row is what you 
want, all you have to do is choose the account for that row, fill in the other cells 
(if necessary), and then click Save & Close.
If the second row doesn’t balance the Debit and Credit columns, continue add­
ing additional rows until you’ve added debit and credit amounts that balance.

WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Creating Opening Balances with Journal Entries
QuickBooks has rules about Accounts Payable (AP) and Ac-
counts Receivable (AR) accounts in journal entries. Each journal 
entry can have only one AP or AR account, and that account 
can appear on only one line of the journal entry. And if you 
add an AP account, you also need to choose a vendor in the 
Name cell. (For AR accounts, you have to choose a customer’s 
name in the Name cell.)
You can get around QuickBooks’ AP and AR limitations by 
setting up the opening balances in all your accounts with a 
journal entry based on your trial balance (page 442) from 
your previous accounting system. Simply create the journal 
entry without the amounts for Accounts Payable and Accounts 
Receivable, as shown in Figure 16-3.
FIGURE 16-3
When you use journal 
entries to create opening 
balances, you have to 
adjust the values in your 
equity account (like re-
tained earnings) to reflect 
the omission of AP and AR. 
Then you can create your 
open customer invoices 
and unpaid vendor bills 
to build the values for 
Accounts Receivable and 
Accounts Payable. 
When your AP and AR ac-
count balances match the 
values on the trial balance, 
the equity account will 
also match its trial balance 
value.

Checking Journal Entries
If you stare off into space and start mumbling, “Debit entries increase asset accounts” 
every time you create a journal entry, it’s wise to check that the journal entry did 
what you wanted. Those savvy in the ways of accounting can visualize debits and 
offsetting credits in their heads, but for novices, thinking about the changes you 
expect in your profit and loss report or balance sheet is easier.
For example, if you plan to create a journal entry to reassign expenses in the Uncat­
egorized Expenses account to their proper expense-account homes, you’d expect 
to see the value in the Uncategorized Expenses account drop to zero and the values 
in the correct expense accounts increase. Figure 16-4 shows how to use a Profit & 
Loss report (page 445) to check your journal entries.
FIGURE 16-4
Top: Before you create a 
journal entry, run a Profit 
& Loss report and look at 
the accounts that you ex-
pect to change. Here, the 
Uncategorized Expenses 
account has $20,000 in 
it, and the Employee 
Benefits account, which is 
the destination for your 
uncategorized expenses, 
has $3,600. 
Bottom: After the journal 
entry reassigns the ex-
penses, refresh the report 
window (page 660) to see 
the journal entry’s effect. 
Here you can see that the 
Uncategorized Expenses 
account’s balance de-
creased and the Employee 
Benefits account’s balance 
increased, just as you 
intended.

RECLASS-
IFICATIONS 
AND 
CORRECTIONS
 NOTE 	 Some journal entries affect both Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss reports. For example, as you’ll learn 
on page 433, a depreciation journal entry uses an asset account (which appears only in the Balance Sheet report) 
and an expense account (which appears only in the Profit & Loss report). In situations like this, you have to review 
both reports to verify your numbers.
Reclassifications and Corrections
As you work with your QuickBooks file, you might realize that you want to use dif­
ferent accounts. For example, as you expand the services you provide, you might 
switch from one top-level income account to several specific income accounts. 
Expense accounts are also prone to change—like when you split the Home Office 
account into separate accounts for utilities, insurance, and repairs, for example. 
Any type of account is a candidate for restructuring, as one building grows into a 
stable of commercial properties, say, or you move from a single mortgage to a bevy 
of mortgages, notes, and loans. Whatever the situation, journal entries can help you 
put funds in the proper accounts.
Reclassifying Accounts
Whether you want to shift funds between accounts because you decide to catego­
rize your finances differently or because you simply made a mistake, you’re moving 
money between accounts of the same type. The benefit to this type of journal entry 
is that you have to think hard about only one side of the transaction—as long as you 
pick the first debit or credit correctly, QuickBooks handles the other side for you.
The debits and credits you choose are the opposite for income and expense ac­
counts. For example, Figure 16-1 shows how to reclassify income, where you debit the 
original income account to decrease its value and credit the new income accounts 
to increase their value. Figure 16-5 shows how to reclassify expenses, in which you 
credit the original expense account to decrease its value and debit the new expense 
accounts to increase their value.
 TIP 	 Accountants sometimes create what are known as reversing journal entries, which are journal entries 
that move money in one direction on one date, and then move the money back to where it came from on another 
date. Reversing journal entries are common at the end of the year, when you need your books configured one 
way to prepare your taxes and another way for your day-to-day bookkeeping. To create a reversing journal entry 
that uses the same accounts—but with opposite assignments for debits and credits—first, in the Make General 
Journal Entries window, display the journal entry you want to reverse. Then, at the top of the window, click the 
Reverse icon.

The debits and credits for ex-

You credit the original expense

Reassigning Jobs
If you need to transfer money between different jobs for the same customer, journal 
entries are the answer. For example, a customer might ask you to apply a credit from 
one job to another because the job with the credit is already complete.
When you move money between jobs, you’re transferring that money into and out of 
Accounts Receivable. Because QuickBooks allows only one AR account per journal 
entry, you need two journal entries to transfer the credit completely. (Figure 10-34 
on page 283 shows what these journal entries look like.) You also need a special 
account to hold the credit transfers; an Other Expense account called something 
like “Clearing Account” will do. After you have the holding account in place, here’s 
how the two journal entries work:
• Transfer the credit from the first job to the holding account. In the first 
journal entry, debit Accounts Receivable for the amount of the credit. (Choose 
the customer and job in the Name cell.) This half of the journal entry removes 
the credit from the job’s balance. In the second row of the journal entry’s table, 
choose the holding account. The amount is already in the Credit cell, which is 
where you want it for moving the amount into the holding account.
• Transfer the money from the holding account to the second job. In this journal 
entry, debit the holding account for the money you’re moving. Then the AR ac­
count receives the amount in its Credit cell. In the Name cell in the AR account 
row, choose the customer and the second job.

RECORDING 
DEPRECIATION 
WITH JOURNAL 
ENTRIES
Recording Depreciation with Journal 
Entries
When you own an asset, such as the Deluxe Cat-o-matic Cat Herder, the machine 
loses value as it ages and clogs with fur balls. Depreciation is an accounting con­
cept, intimately tied to IRS rules, that reduces the value of the machine and lets 
your financial reports show a more accurate picture of how the money you spend 
on assets links to the income your company earns. (See the box on page 435 for an 
example of how depreciation works.)
Typically, you’ll calculate depreciation in a spreadsheet so you can also see the asset’s 
current depreciated value and how much more it will depreciate. But depreciation 
doesn’t deal with hard cash, which is why you need to record it with a journal entry. 
Unlike some journal entries, which can use a wide range of accounts, depreciation 
journal entries are easy to create because the accounts you can choose are limited. 
Here’s how it works:
• The debit account is an expense account, usually called Depreciation Expense. 
(If you don’t have a Depreciation Expense account, see page 55 to learn how 
to create one.)
• The credit account is a fixed asset account called something like Less Accu­
mulated Depreciation. Figure 16-6 (top) shows how to set up your fixed asset 
accounts for things like machinery, vehicles, and furniture. You create a parent 
fixed asset account called Depreciable Assets and then create separate fixed 
asset subaccounts within that account so you can see the total value of all your 
fixed assets on your balance sheet. The Accumulated Depreciation account 
(which you also create) appears after the depreciable asset accounts at the 
same level as the parent Depreciable Assets account, so you can see how much 
depreciation you’ve deducted.
 TIP 	 If you depreciate the same amount each year, memorize the first depreciation transaction you create 
(page 321). The following year, when it’s time to enter depreciation, press Ctrl+T to open the Memorized Transac­
tion List window, select the depreciation transaction, and then click Enter Transaction.
Another way to copy a journal entry is to open the Make General Journal Entries window and then click the Previous 
button (the left arrow) until you see the journal entry you want. Then right-click the window and choose Duplicate 
Journal Entry from the shortcut menu. Make the changes you want, and then click Save & Close.
For a depreciation journal entry, you want to reduce the value of the fixed asset 
account and add value to the Depreciation Expense account. If you remember that 
debit entries increase the value of expense accounts, you can figure out that the 
debit goes with the expense account and the credit goes to the fixed asset account. 
Figure 16-6 shows how depreciation debits and credits work.

Bottom: If you have sev-

approach is to create a

simply record a single

the depreciation credits, as 
shown here.
Recording Owner’s Contributions
Most attorneys suggest that you contribute some cash to get your company off the 
ground. However, you might make noncash contributions to the company, like your 
home computer, printer, and other office equipment. Then, as you run your business 
from your home, you may want to allocate a portion of your mortgage interest, util­
ity bills, homeowners’ insurance premiums, home repairs, and other house-related 
expenses to your company. In both these situations, journal entries are the way to 
get money into the accounts in your chart of accounts.
 TIP 	 If you write a personal check to jump-start your company’s checking account balance, simply record a 
deposit to your business checking account and assign that deposit to your owner’s equity account.

How Depreciation Works
When your company depreciates assets, you add dollars here, 
subtract dollars there—and none of those dollars are real. It 
sounds like funny money, but depreciation is an accounting 
concept that presents a more realistic picture of financial 
performance. To see how it works, here’s an example of what 
happens when a company depreciates a large purchase:
Suppose your company buys a Deep Thought supercomputer 
for $500,000. You spent $500,000, and you now own an asset 
worth $500,000. Your company’s balance sheet moves that 
money from your bank account to a fixed asset account, so 
your total assets remain the same.
The problem arises when you sell the computer, perhaps 10 
years later when it would make a fabulous boat anchor. If you 
don’t depreciate the computer, the moment you sell it, its 
value plummets from $500,000 to your selling price—$1,000, 
say. This decrease in value shows up as an expense, putting a 
huge dent in your profits for the 10th year.
Shareholders don’t like it when profits change dramatically 
from year to year—up or down. With depreciation, you can 
spread the cost of a big purchase over several years, which does 
a better job of matching expenses to the revenue generated 
by the asset. As a result, shareholders can see how well you 
use assets to generate income.
Depreciation calculations come in several flavors: straight-
line, sum of the years’ digits, and double declining balance. 
Straight-line depreciation is the easiest and most common. 
To calculate annual straight-line depreciation over the life of 
the asset, subtract the salvage value (how much the asset will 
be worth when you sell it) from the purchase price, and then 
divide by the number of years of useful life, like so:
• Purchase price: $500,000
• Expected salvage value after 10 years: $1,000
• Useful life: the 10 years you expect to run the computer
• Annual depreciation: $499,000 divided by 10, which 
equals $49,900
Every year, you use the computer to make money for your 
business, and you show $49,900 as an equipment expense 
associated with that income. On your books, the value of the 
Deep Thought computer drops by another $49,900 each year, 
until the balance reaches the $1,000 salvage value at the end 
of the 10th year. This decrease in value each year keeps your 
balance sheet (page 451) more accurate and avoids the sudden 
drop in asset value in year 10.
The other methods—which are more complex—depreciate 
assets faster in the first few years (called accelerated deprecia-
tion), making for big tax write-offs in a hurry. Page 433 explains 
how to record journal entries for depreciation, but your best 
bet is to ask your accountant how to post depreciation in your 
QuickBooks accounts.
Recording Initial Noncash Contributions
When you contribute equipment to your company, you’ve already paid for the equip­
ment, so you want its value to show up in your company file. You can’t use the Write 
Checks window to make that transfer, but a journal entry can record that contribution:
• Credit the owner’s equity account (or, if your company is a corporation, the 
common stock account) with the value of the equipment you’re contributing 
to the company.
• Debit the equipment asset account so its balance shows the value of the equip­
ment that now belongs to the company.

Recording Home-Office Expenses
If you use a home office for your work, the money you spent on home-office ex­
penses is already out the door, but those expenditures are equivalent to personal 
funds you contribute to your business. If your company is a corporation, you credit 
your equity account with the amount of these home-office expenses. Here’s how 
you show this contribution in QuickBooks:
• Credit the total home-office expenses to an equity account for your sharehold­
ers’ distribution or owner’s contributions to the company.
• Debit the expense accounts for each type of home-office expense, as shown 
in Figure 16-7.
FIGURE 16-7
After you credit the owner’s contribution 
account and debit the home-office expense 
accounts, your home-office expenses show 
up in the Profit & Loss report (page 445) 
and your owner’s contribution appears on 
the Balance Sheet (page 451).
 TIP 	 Another way to handle a home office is to charge your company rent for your office space. That way you, 
as the homeowner, have rental property, so you can depreciate the portion of your home rented to your company. 
(However, this depreciation complicates things down the road when you sell your home.) If your company is a 
corporation, it gets to take a tax deduction for rent on its corporate tax return.

A
s if your typical workday isn’t hectic enough, the end of the year brings with 
it an assortment of additional bookkeeping and accounting tasks. As long as 
you’ve kept on top of your bookkeeping during the year, you can delegate 
most of these year-end tasks to QuickBooks with just a few clicks. (If you shrugged 
off your data entry during the year, even the mighty QuickBooks can’t help.) This 
chapter describes the tasks you have to perform at the end of each fiscal year (or 
other fiscal period, for that matter) and how to delegate them to QuickBooks. (The 
box on page 439 describes a QuickBooks feature that helps you remember these 
various tasks.)
Checking for Problems
If you work with an accountant, you may never run a report from the 
Reports→Accountant & Taxes submenu unless your accountant asks you to. But if 
you prepare your own tax returns, running the following reports at the end of each 
year will help sniff out any problems:
• The Audit Trail report (Reports→Accountant & Taxes→Audit Trail) is especially 
important if several people work on your company file and transactions seem 
to disappear or change. QuickBooks’ audit trail feature is always turned on, 
keeping track of changes to transactions, who makes them, and when. You can 
check this permanent record by running the Audit Trail report—shown in Figure 
17-1—to watch for things like deleted invoices or modifications to transactions 
after they’ve been reconciled. (You have to be the QuickBooks administrator 
or have permission to generate sensitive financial reports to run this report.)

 NOTE 	 QuickBooks’ Condense Data utility (page 510) removes the audit trail information for transactions 
that it deletes. So if you’re watching transaction activity, print an Audit Trail report before using Condense Data, 
and (as always), back up your company file regularly.
• The Voided/Deleted Transactions Summary and Voided/Deleted Transac­

Getting Rid of Uncleared Transactions from Closed Periods
You successfully reconciled your bank account (page 389) and your QuickBooks 
checking account balance matches your bank statement balance. Things are looking 
good…until you stumble across a few unreconciled transactions (such as checks, bill 
payments, and deposits) from previous years—years that you’ve already filed tax 
returns for and closed in QuickBooks. Good news: there’s a way to clean up these old 
unreconciled transactions without messing up your tax returns or your reconciliation.
 NOTE 	 You might wonder how unreconciled transactions from closed periods crop up in the first place. The 
most likely culprit is an adjustment transaction (page 394) that someone used to force a reconciliation to work. 
For example, perhaps your predecessor couldn’t find the unreconciled transactions that you’ve discovered. To force 
the account to reconcile, that person clicked Reconcile Now and told QuickBooks to add an adjustment transaction 
to make QuickBooks’ balance match the bank’s balance. That adjustment reconciled the account, but it left the 
real transactions orphaned and unreconciled.
Here’s how to look for old, unreconciled transactions:
1.	 In the Home Page’s Banking panel, click Check Register and then, in the 
Select Account drop-down list that appears, choose the bank account you 
want to examine.
QuickBooks opens that account’s register window.
2.	 At the register window’s bottom left, in the “Sort by” drop-down list, choose 
“Cleared status.”
Sorting by cleared status makes QuickBooks list Reconciled transactions first 
(they have checkmarks in the checkmark column), followed by cleared transac­
tions (ones you’ve selected in a reconciliation that’s in progress; they’re indicated 
by asterisks in their checkmark cells), and finally uncleared transactions (which 
have blank checkmark cells).

3.	 Scroll up the register window’s table to find the first uncleared transaction.
Figure 17-2 includes two uncleared transactions dated from a closed period.
FIGURE 17-2
In the “Sort by” drop-
down list, choose “Cleared 
status” to display recon-
ciled transactions followed 
by cleared transactions, 
and finally uncleared 
transactions. 
The first two uncleared 
transactions here are from 
the previous year.
Unreconciled transactions from closed periods present a couple of problems. First, 
they’re part of your records that you used to prepare your tax returns: if you void 
them, you’d have to file an amended tax return. In addition, if you try to reconcile them 
as is, your next reconciliation won’t balance. What you need is an offsetting transac­
tion in the current time period. You can use a journal entry to do that. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Company→Make General Journal Entries.
The Make General Journal Entries window opens.
2.	 In the Date box, choose today’s date. If necessary, fill in the Entry No. field 
with a journal entry number.
QuickBooks automatically increments the value in the Entry No. box, but you 
can type another value if you wish.
3.	 In the first Account cell, choose the bank account with the old, unreconciled 
transaction(s), and then fill in the rest of the fields in that row.

Chapter 17: Performing Year-End Tasks 
441
CHECKING FOR 
PROBLEMS
In the row’s Debit cell, fill in the value of the unreconciled transaction (in Figure 
17-2, that’s $150). Because the unreconciled check in this example decreased 
the bank balance, you debit the checking account to increase its balance in 
the current period. In the Memo cell, type a note, such as “To void prior year 
unreconciled check #1189.”
4.	 In the second row’s Account cell, choose the account used in the unrecon­
ciled transaction (in this example, 6342 Transportation). 
The program automatically fills in the second row’s Credit cell with the value 
you typed in the first row’s Debit cell (Figure 17-3). In this example, the original 
check increased the corresponding expense account’s total. This credit decreases 
the expense account’s total in the current time period.
5.	 Repeat steps 3 and 4 to void other unreconciled transactions from closed 
periods.
Add pairs of debits and credits for each unreconciled transaction you want to 
void (you can do this all in the same journal entry).
FIGURE 17-3
If you’re voiding checks or 
bill payments, you debit 
the checking account to 
increase its balance, and 
you credit the correspond-
ing expense account to 
decrease its balance. 
To void a deposit, you 
would credit the checking 
account and debit the ac-
count associated with the 
deposit, such as an income 
account.
6.	 Click Save & Close.
When you save the journal entry, QuickBooks creates transactions that appear in 
your bank account register. Now all you have to do is reconcile the old transactions 
and the journal entry transactions:
1.	 In the Home Page’s Banking panel, click Reconcile.
The Begin Reconciliation window opens.
2.	 In the Statement Date box, choose the date from your previous reconcili­
ation (Figure 17-4).
For example, if QuickBooks fills in 1/31/15, type 12/31/14 instead.

3.	 Fill in the Ending Balance box with the Beginning Balance value, and then 
click Continue.
The beginning and ending balances are equal because the original unreconciled 
transaction and the journal entry you created offset one another. The net change 
to the account balance is zero.
4.	 Click Continue and then, in the “Reconcile – <account name>” window that 
opens, click the checkmark cells for the old, unreconciled transactions and 
the transactions created by the journal entry, as shown in Figure 17-5.
If everything worked the way it should, the Difference value is 0.00.
5.	 Click Reconcile Now.
That’s it! The old transactions are reconciled without affecting the values on your 
filed tax returns. And your QuickBooks bank account balance and reconciliation still 
match the numbers from your bank statement.
Viewing Your Trial Balance
The Trial Balance report is named after the report’s original purpose: totaling the 
balances of every account in the debit and credit columns to see whether the debit 
and credit totals balanced. If they didn’t, the bookkeeper had to track down the 
mistakes and try again.

QuickBooks doesn’t make arithmetic mistakes, so you don’t need a trial balance to 
make sure that debits and credits match. Nonetheless, the Trial Balance report is 
still handy. Accountants like to examine it for errant account assignments before 
diving into tax preparation or giving financial advice—and for good reason: The Trial 
Balance report is the only place in QuickBooks where you can see all your accounts 
and their balances in the same place, as shown in Figure 17-6.
To display this report, choose Reports→Accountant & Taxes→Trial Balance, and 
QuickBooks generates a Trial Balance report for the previous month. The accounts 
appear in the same order that they’re listed in your Chart of Accounts window. If 
you want to see the trial balance for your entire fiscal year, choose This Fiscal Year 
in the Dates box. 
Generating Financial Reports
When you keep your company’s books day after day, all those invoices, checks, 
and other transactions blur together. But hidden within that maelstrom of figures is 
important information for you, your accountant, your investors, and the IRS. When 
consolidated and presented the right way, your books can tell you a lot about what 
your company does right, does wrong, could do better, and has to pay in taxes.

Over the years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has nurtured a 
standard of accounting known as GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). 
GAAP includes a trio of financial statements that together paint a portrait of company 
performance: the income statement (also known as the profit and loss report), the 
balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows.
Generating financial statements in QuickBooks is easy. But unless you understand 
what these statements tell you and you can spot suspect numbers, you may simply 
end up generating fodder for your paper shredder. If you’re new to business, read 
the next few sections of this chapter, which are about what the income statement, 
balance sheet, and statement of cash flows show. If you’re already an expert in all 
that, jump to the section on generating these reports (page 448).

 NOTE 	 When you close out a year on your company’s books, these three special financial reports are a 
must. If you’re a business maven and need a bunch of additional reports to manage your business, Chapter 23 
has instructions for finding the reports you need and customizing them to your demanding specifications.
The Profit & Loss Report
The Profit & Loss report (Reports→Company & Financial→Profit & Loss Standard) 
is more like a video than a snapshot. It covers a period of time (a month, a quarter, 
or a full year, for example) and shows whether your company is making money—or 
hemorrhaging it.
The money you make selling services or products (called revenue or income) sits 
at the top of the Profit & Loss report. Beneath it, your expenses gradually whittle 
away at that income until you’re left with a profit or loss at the bottom. The report 
shows the progression from sales to the net income your company earned after 
paying the bills:
• Income. The first category in a Profit & Loss report is income, which is simply the 
revenue your company generates by selling products and services. Regardless 
of how you earn revenue (selling services or products, or even charging fees), 
the report shows all the income accounts in your chart of accounts and how 
much you brought into each one (Figure 17-7).
FIGURE 17-7
The Income section at the top of the 
Profit & Loss report lists the accounts 
that represent the money you make 
when you sell to customers. 
Most companies have to subtract 
the cost of goods sold from income 
to figure out how much profit they 
really made. Cost of goods sold may 
include the cost of materials and 
labor to build products, the cost of 
products you purchase for resale, 
and the cost of sales activities.

GENERATING 
FINANCIAL 
REPORTS
 TIP 	 The Profit & Loss report lists accounts in the order they appear in your company file’s chart of accounts. 
If you want to report your income and expenses in a specific order, you can rearrange the accounts in the Chart of 
Accounts window (press Ctrl+A to open it). To do that, put your cursor over the diamond to the left of an account’s 
name. When the cursor changes to a four-headed arrow, drag the account to where you want it.
• Cost of Goods Sold. Unless you gather rocks from your yard and then sell them 
as alien amulets, the products you sell carry some initial cost. For example, with 
products you purchase for resale, the cost of those goods includes the original 
price you paid for them, the shipping costs you incurred to get them, and so on. 
The Profit & Loss report’s Cost of Goods Sold section adds up the underlying 
costs associated with your product sales.
 NOTE 	 If you don’t sell inventory items, you might not have a Cost of Goods Sold section in your report. 
QuickBooks automatically creates a Cost of Goods Sold account when you create your first inventory item. However, 
if you want to track other costs associated with selling goods—such as how much you paid for the labor required 
to build the products you sell, the cost of shipping, the cost of sales, and so on—you can create as many additional 
Cost of Goods Sold accounts as you want.
• Gross Profit. Gross profit is the profit you make after subtracting the cost of 
goods sold from your total income and before subtracting expenses. For ex­
ample, if you paid $60,000 to purchase equipment and then sold that equipment 
for $100,000, your gross profit is $40,000. (The box on page 447 explains how 
to see whether your gross profit is in line with your industry.)
• Expense. The next and longest section of the report is for expenses—all the 
things you spend money on running your business, which are sometimes called 
overhead. For example, office rent, telephone service, and bank fees all fall into 
the overhead expense bucket. The name of the game is to keep these expenses 
as low as possible without hindering your ability to make money.
• Net Ordinary Income. QuickBooks uses the term “net ordinary income” to de­
scribe the money that’s left over after you pay the bills. (You’ve probably also 
run across this measure referred to as net profit or net earnings.) Figure 17-8 
shows the Expenses and Net Ordinary Income portions of a Profit & Loss report.
• Other Income/Expense. Income and expenses that don’t relate to your primary 
business fall into this category. The most common entrants are the interest 
income you earn from your savings at the bank, the interest you pay on loans, 
and bad debt. In this category, income and expense are bundled together and 
offset each other. The result is called net other income. For example, if you have 
only a smidgeon of cash in savings but a honking big mortgage, your net other 
income will be a negative number.
• Net Income. At long last, you reach the end of the report. Net income is the 
money that’s left after subtracting all the costs and expenses you incur. If this 
number is positive, congratulations—your company made money! If it’s nega­
tive, your expenses were more than your income, and something’s gotta give.

If your company makes 
more money than it 
spends, your net income 
is a positive number, as 
shown here. 
Profit & Loss reports 
don’t label your result 
a loss when your com-
pany spends more than 
it makes. Instead, a loss 
shows up as a negative net 
income number, whether 
it’s net ordinary, other, or 
overall net income.
UP TO SPEED
Profit Percentage
There’s no question that sales are important. But the percent-
age gross profit you achieve is the real test of whether you’re 
keeping up with your competitors. To see whether your com-
pany is in line with what’s typical for your industry, compare 
the ratio of your gross profit to your sales. For example, in 
construction, gross profit between 40 and 60 percent is typical. 
(The business reference section of your local library is a great 
place to find industry statistics, and many libraries offer online 
access to their reference materials.)
QuickBooks is happy to calculate percentage gross profit for 
you. Here’s what you do:
1.	 In the Profit & Loss report window’s menu bar, click 
Customize Report.
2.	 In the Modify Report: Profit & Loss dialog box, click the 
Display tab (if it isn’t already selected).
3.	 Turn on the “% of Income” checkbox at the dialog box’s 
lower right, and then click OK.
QuickBooks adds a column to the report showing the percent-
age of income that each row in the report represents. The Gross 
Profit value in the “% of Income” column, circled in Figure 17-9, 
is your percentage gross profit.
Percentages also come in handy for comparing job profitability. 
Because jobs vary in size, it’s hard to compare profitability by 
looking at the raw numbers. For example, one job may produce 
$50,000 in total income and $10,000 in net income. Another job 
may also produce $50,000 in total income but only $5,000 in 
net income. Percentages let you see how profitable customers 
and jobs truly are. For example, suppose each job’s total income 
represents 10 percent of your total income for the year. The job 
with $10,000 in net income may represent 15 percent of your 
total net income, while the other job, at $5,000 net income, 
is only 7.5 percent.
If you run a “Profit & Loss by Job” report (page 451) and add 
the “% of Income” column as described above, the Net Income 
value at the bottom of that column shows the net profit margin 
for each job. That’s the number you want to focus on. When a 
job’s net income percentage is higher than your company’s total 
income percentage, that job is more profitable than average.

GENERATING A PROFIT & LOSS REPORT
When you choose Reports→Company & Financial, QuickBooks gives you several 
built-in profit and loss reports to pick from. Choose Profit & Loss Standard to see a 
month-to-date report. But for many small companies, month-to-date numbers can 
be rather sparse. Figure 17-10 describes how to change the month-to-date Profit & 
Loss report that QuickBooks produces into a quarter-to-date or year-to-date report 
instead. (Page 601 tells you how to save a report after you tweak it to look the way 
you want.)
 NOTE 	 Before you generate your first financial statement, be sure that QuickBooks reports your numbers 
using your company’s accounting basis. The Summary Reports Basis preference (page 661) sets your reports to 
either accrual or cash accounting. If you choose the Cash option, your Profit & Loss reports show income only 
after you receive customer payments and show expenses only after you pay bills. With the Accrual option, income 
appears in Profit & Loss reports as soon as you record an invoice or other type of sale, and expenses show up as 
soon as you enter bills.

OTHER PROFIT & LOSS REPORTS
If the Profit & Loss Standard report described in the previous section isn’t what you 
want, take a few minutes to see if any of QuickBooks’ other built-in reports fit the 
bill. Here’s a guide to the other Profit & Loss reports on the Reports→Company & 
Financial submenu and when you might use them:
• Profit & Loss Detail. Only the tiniest of companies—or the most persnickety of 
bookkeepers—use this report regularly. It’s a year-to-date report that includes 
a separate line for every service and product you sold, every other charge that 
produced revenue, and every item on every bill you paid. It comes in handy 
when, for example, you restore a backup copy of your company file and want 
to look at your previous company file to identify the transactions you have to 
recreate in the restored backup.

 TIP 	 If you spot a questionable number in a report, double-click the number for a closer inspection. (When 
you put your cursor over a number in a report, it changes to an icon that looks like a Z [for “zoom”] inside a 
magnifying glass; that’s your clue that double-clicking the number will drill down into the details.) For example, if 
you double-click a number in a Profit & Loss Standard report, QuickBooks displays a Transaction Detail by Account 
report that lists each transaction that contributed to the total. In a Profit & Loss Detail report, double-clicking a 
transaction opens the corresponding window (such as Create Invoices) so you can view that transaction.
• Profit & Loss YTD Comparison. This report puts the profit and loss results 
for two periods side by side: the current month to date and the year to date. 
However, most businesses prefer to compare a period with its predecessor from 
the previous year to see business trends more clearly, as the next report does.
• Profit & Loss Prev Year Comparison. If you own a gift shop or other seasonal 
business, you know that sales are highest during your peak season (for example, 
around the holidays for gift shops and many retail businesses). If you compared 
the last quarter of one year with the first quarter of the next, the profit and loss 
report would look pretty grim: Sales would be down and possibly exacerbated 
by returns from holiday purchases. To see whether your business is growing, 
use this report (shown in Figure 17-11) to compare your previous year with the 
current year.
FIGURE 17-11
This report sets the Dates 
box to “This Fiscal Year-

To see where growth 
is strong or stagnant, 
add columns that show 
the change in dollars or 
percentages (page 589). 
Right after your fiscal year 
ends, you can change the 
Dates box to Last Fiscal

• Profit & Loss by Job. If you suspect that some of your customers and jobs are 
less profitable than others—and you want to learn from your mistakes—run this 
report. It displays each of your customers and jobs in its own column so you 
can compare how much profit you made from each one. The box on page 447 
tells you how to compare apples to apples in this report.
• Profit & Loss by Class. If you use classes to track performance for different 
business units or locations, run this report, which includes a column for each 
class. (If you’d rather generate a Profit & Loss report that displays only one class, 
modify this report [page 589] to filter for that class.) The last column in this 
report is Unclassified, which shows all the transactions that don’t have a class 
assignment. The next report can help you find such transactions.
• Profit & Loss Unclassified. If you use classes, then before you pretty up and 
print your class-based Profit & Loss reports, run this one to see the transactions 
without class assignments. Depending on how you use classes, unclassified 
transactions might be perfectly acceptable. For example, if you track income 
by partner, overhead expenses aren’t related to individual partners. In that situ­
ation, most income accounts should have values, but some expense accounts 
could have zero balances. However, if you created a class for overhead, then 
you shouldn’t see any transactions in this report. If you do, double-click each 
transaction to open it in its corresponding window, assign the appropriate class, 
and then save it.
The Balance Sheet
If a profit and loss report is like a video, a balance sheet is more like a portrait. 
This report (Reports→Company & Financial→Balance Sheet Standard) shows how 
much your company owns (assets), how much it owes (liabilities), and the result­
ing equity in the company at a given point in time. While a profit and loss report 
tells you whether you’re making money, the balance sheet helps you analyze your 
company’s financial strength.
One thing you can count on with a balance sheet is that there’s a steady relationship 
among the total assets, total liabilities, and equity, as you can see in Figure 17-12. 
Here’s the formula that puts the “balance” into balance sheets:
Assets - Liabilities = Equity
As you buy more or borrow more, the value of your equity changes to make up the 
difference between the value of your assets and liabilities. Another way to look at 
this equation is that your asset value equals the sum of your liabilities and equity.
Here’s what to look for in each section of a balance sheet:
• Assets. Assets are things of value that a company owns, such as equipment, 
land, product inventory, Accounts Receivable, cash, and even brand names. On 
a balance sheet, you want to see significantly more money in the Assets section 
than in the Liabilities section.

FIGURE 17-12
The key to a good-looking balance 
sheet is not having too much debt. 
How much is too much? It depends 
on the industry you’re in, but the 
acid test is if you closed up shop 
today and sold all your assets, would 
you have enough money to pay 
off your liabilities? If the answer is 
no, you’ll have a hard time finding 
a bank willing to lend you more 
money.
 NOTE 	 Even with assets, you can have too much of a good thing. Assets aren’t corporate collector’s items—
companies should use assets to make money. A measure called return on assets (the ratio of net income to total 
assets) shows whether a company is using assets effectively to produce income. Return on assets varies from 
industry to industry, but, typically, less than 5 percent is poor.
• Liabilities. Liabilities include Accounts Payable (bills you haven’t yet paid), 
unpaid expenses, loans, mortgages, and even future expenses such as pensions. 
Debt on its own isn’t bad; it’s too much debt that can drag a company down, 
particularly when business is slow, since debt payments are due every month 
whether your business produced revenue or not.
• Equity. Equity on a balance sheet is the corporate counterpart of the equity 
you have in your house. When you buy a house, your initial equity is the down 
payment you make. But both the decreasing balance on your mortgage and 
any increase in the value of your house contribute to an increase in your equity.

Equity in a company is the dollar value that remains after you subtract liabilities

GENERATING A BALANCE SHEET REPORT
A balance sheet is a snapshot of accounts on a given date. The various built-in 
Balance Sheet reports that QuickBooks offers differ in whether they show only 
account balances or all the transactions that make up those balances. Choose 
Reports→Company & Financial, and then pick from the following reports:
• Balance Sheet Standard. This report includes every asset, liability, and equity 
account in your chart of accounts except for ones with zero balances, as shown 
in Figure 17-12. QuickBooks automatically sets the Dates box to “This Fiscal Year-
to-date” so the report shows your balance sheet for the current date. If you want 
to see the balance sheet for the end of a quarter or end of the year instead, in 
the Dates box, choose This Fiscal Quarter, This Fiscal Year, or Last Fiscal Year.
• Balance Sheet Detail. This report shows the transactions in each of your asset, 
liability, and equity accounts over a period of time. If a number on your Balance 
Sheet Standard report looks odd, use this report to verify your transactions. 
Double-click a transaction’s value to open the corresponding window, such as 
Enter Bills.
• Balance Sheet Summary. If you want to see the key numbers in your balance 
sheet without having to scan past the individual accounts in each section, this 
report shows subtotals for each category of a balance sheet, such as Checking/
Savings, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and so on.
• Balance Sheet Prev Year Comparison. If you want to compare your financial 
strength from year to year, this report has four columns at your service: one 
each for the current and previous years, one for the dollar-value change, and 
the fourth for the percentage change.
 NOTE 	 When you review your Balance Sheet Prev Year Comparison report, you typically want to see decreasing 
liabilities. If liabilities have increased, then assets should have increased as well, because you don’t want to see 
more debt without more assets to show for the trouble. Equity is the value of your—and your shareholders’, if 
you have them—ownership in the company, so it should increase each year. (If you use QuickBooks to keep the 
books for your one-person consulting company, the equity may not increase each year if, for example, you don’t 
have many company assets and you withdraw most of the profit you make as your salary.)
• Balance Sheet by Class. This report lists your asset, liability, and equity ac­
counts, and includes a column for each class. However, to obtain accurate results 
from this report, you have to enter transactions in a specific way (for example, 
using only one class in each transaction, and recording transactions using 
QuickBooks features like Create Invoices and Receive Payments). To learn more 
about this report, search QuickBooks Help for “balance sheet by class report.”

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Net Income and Retained Earnings
I just changed the date on my Balance Sheet report from 
December 31 of last year to January 1 of this year, and the 
Net Income and Retained Earnings numbers are different. 
What’s the deal?
At the end of a fiscal year, account balances go through some 
changes to get your books ready for another year of commerce. 
For example, at the end of one fiscal year, your income and 
expense accounts show how much you earned and spent dur-
ing that year. But come January 1 (or whatever day your fiscal 
year starts), all those accounts have to be zero so you can start 
your new fiscal year fresh. QuickBooks makes this happen by 
adjusting your net income behind the scenes.
Say your net income on the Profit & Loss report is $110,678.67 on 
December 31, 2015. That number appears at the bottom of the 
Balance Sheet report as the value of the Net Income account 
(in the Equity section), as shown in Figure 17-13, top. At the 
beginning of the new fiscal year, QuickBooks automatically 
moves the previous year’s net income into the Retained Earn-
ings equity account, which resets the Net Income account’s 
value to zero.
Some companies like to keep equity for the current year 
separate from the equity for all previous years. To do that, 
you need one additional equity account and one simple journal 
entry. Create an equity account (page 57) called something like 
Past Equity with an account number greater than the one you 
use for Retained Earnings. (For example, if Retained Earnings 
is 3900, set Past Equity to 3950.) Then, when you close your 
books at the end of the year, create a journal entry to move 
the current retained earnings value ($14,043.11 in this example) 
from the Retained Earnings account to the Past Equity account 
(Figure 17-13, bottom). That way, when QuickBooks moves the 
current year’s net income into the Retained Earnings equity 
account, you can see both current and past equity values, as 
shown in Figure 17-13.
The Statement of Cash Flows
Thanks to noncash accounting anomalies like accrual reporting and depreciation, 
profit and loss reports don’t tell you how much cash you have on hand. Looking 
at QuickBooks’ Statement of Cash Flows report helps you figure out whether your 
company generates enough cash to keep the doors open. Your balance sheet might 
look great—$10 million in assets and only $500,000 in liabilities, say—but if a $50,000 
payment is due and you have only $3,000 in the bank, you have cash flow problems. 
(The box on page 458 describes ways to evaluate your cash flow.)
The concept of cash flow is easy to understand. In the words of every film-noir detec­
tive, follow the money. Cash flow is nothing more than the real money that flows into 
and out of your company—not the noncash transactions, such as depreciation, that 
you see on a profit and loss report. Figure 17-14 shows sources of cash in a sample 
Statement of Cash Flows.

 WARNING 	 Cash provided by operating activities shows how much money your day-to-day operations 
produce. When you sell an asset (which is an investing activity), it shows up as a gain or loss on the Profit & 
Loss report, which temporarily increases or reduces your net income. Beware: The effect of investing activities 
on the Profit & Loss report can hide problems brewing in your operations, which is why you should examine the 
Statement of Cash Flows report. If your income derives mainly from investing and financing activities instead of 
operating activities, you’ve got a problem.

A Statement of Cash Flows 
report organizes transactions 
into various activity categories. 
Cash from operating activities 
is the most desirable; when a 
company’s ongoing operations 
generate cash, the business 
can sustain itself without cash 
coming from other sources. 
Things like buying and selling 
buildings or making money 
in the stock market using 
company money are investing 
activities. 
Borrowing money or selling 
stock in your company brings 
in cash from outside sources, 
called financing activities. 
(New companies often have no 
other sources of cash.)
GENERATING A STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
To create a Statement of Cash Flows, QuickBooks automatically assigns the ac­
counts that appear in your company’s balance sheet to one of the three cash flow 
categories—operating, investing, or financing—and the program almost always gets 
those assignments right. For example, Accounts Receivable and Inventory appear 
as operating accounts, fixed asset accounts show up as investing, and accounts for 
loans fall under financing. Unless you’re a financial expert or your accountant gives 
you explicit instructions about a change, you’re better off leaving QuickBooks’ ac­
count classifications alone. If you need to reassign accounts for your Statement of 
Cash Flows report, this section tells you how.
Generating a Statement of Cash Flows is easy because you have only one report to 
choose from. Simply choose Reports→Company & Financial→Statement of Cash 
Flows, and QuickBooks creates a report that displays your cash flow for your fiscal 
year to date. To view the Statement of Cash Flows report for a quarter or a year 
instead, in the Dates box, choose This Fiscal Quarter or This Fiscal Year.

REPORTS
 NOTE 	 The Operating Activities section of the report includes the label “Adjustments to reconcile Net Income 
to net cash provided by operations.” What that means is that QuickBooks calculates the net income at the top 
of the Statement of Cash Flows report on an accrual basis (meaning income appears as of the invoice date, not 
the day the customer pays). But the Statement of Cash Flows is by nature a cash-based report, so the program 
has to add and subtract transactions to get net income on a cash basis. (See page xxii for more on the difference 
between cash-based and accrual-based accounting.)
The account assignments for the Statement of Cash Flows report are controlled by a 
collection of QuickBooks preferences. Here’s how to view the account assignments 
or change them:
1.	 In the Statement of Cash Flows report window’s toolbar, click the Classify 
Cash button.
The Preferences dialog box opens to the Reports & Graphs section and 
selects the Company Preferences tab (as long as you have QuickBooks ad­
ministrator privileges, that is). You can also open this dialog box by choosing 
Edit→Preferences→Reports & Graphs.
2.	 In the Preferences dialog box, click the Classify Cash button.
QuickBooks opens the Classify Cash dialog box.
3.	 To change the category to which an account belongs (Operating, Investing, 
or Financing), click the cell in the column for the new category.
If you made changes and fear you’ve mangled the settings beyond repair, click 
Default to reset the categories to the ones QuickBooks used initially.
4.	 When the assignments are the way you want, click OK to close the dialog box.
That’s it—you’ve reassigned the accounts.
Other Helpful Financial Reports
Although financial statements are the ones that people like shareholders and the 
IRS want to see, other financial reports help you, the business owner, keep tabs on 
how your enterprise is doing. Here are a few QuickBooks reports that can help you 
evaluate your business’s performance:
 NOTE 	 Reports that apply to specific bookkeeping and accounting tasks are explained in the chapters about 
those tasks, such as Accounts Receivable reports in Chapter 13.

Expert Cash Flow Analysis
Thanks to today’s accounting rules, cash isn’t always connected 
to revenues and expenses. And a dollar in sales isn’t necessarily 
a dollar of cash. Here’s what financial analysts look for when 
they evaluate a company’s health based on its statement of 
cash flows:
• A net income value that’s close to the amount of cash 
you earn from operating activities means net income is 
mostly from business operations and the company can 
support itself.
• Cash from operations that’s growing at the same rate as 
(or faster than) the growth of net income indicates that 
the company is maintaining (or even improving) its ability 
to sustain business.
• Cash that’s increasing means the company won’t have 
to resort to financing to keep the business going. 
• Negative cash flow is often the sign of a rapidly growing 
company—without financing, the company grows only as 
fast as it can generate cash from operations. If a company 
isn’t growing quickly and still can’t generate cash, then 
something is wrong.
• If an increase in cash comes primarily from selling assets, 
the company’s future looks grim. Selling assets to raise 
cash sometimes means the company can’t borrow any 
more because banks don’t like what they see. Because 
assets often produce sales, selling assets means less 
cash generated in the future—and you can see where 
that leads.
• Reviewing income and sales. If you’re introducing enhanced services to 
keep your best customers—or you’re looking for the customers you want 
your competition to steal—use the Income by Customer Summary report 
(Reports→Company & Financial→Income by Customer Summary). It shows 
total income for each of your customers; that is, the total dollar amount from all 
your income and expense accounts associated with each customer. Customers 
with low income totals might be good targets for more energetic sales pitches. 
If you find that most of your income comes from only a few customers, you may 
want to protect your income stream by lining up more customers. (One thing 
this report doesn’t show is how profitable your sales to customers are; the box 
on page 447 explains how to see that.)
 TIP 	 If you want to produce a report showing performance over several years to evaluate trends, you can set 
a report’s date range to include the years you want to compare. Then modify the report as explained on page 
589 to include a column for each year.
• Reviewing expenses. On the expense side, the Expenses by Vendor Summary 
report (Reports→Company & Financial→Expenses by Vendor Summary) shows 
how much you spend with each vendor. If you spend tons with certain vendors, 
maybe it’s time to negotiate volume discounts, find additional vendors as back­
ups, or set up electronic ordering to speed up deliveries.

 TIP 	 The Company Snapshot (page 43) is another tool that helps you evaluate how your business is doing. For 
example, the Company Snapshot window’s Company tab can include graphs such as Prev Year Income Comparison, 
Income Breakdown, Prev Year Expense Comparison, Expense Breakdown, Income and Expense Trend, and so on.
• Comparing income and expenses. The Income & Expense Graph 
(Reports→Company & Financial→Income & Expense Graph) includes a bar 
graph that shows income and expenses by month and a pie chart that breaks 
down either income or expenses (click Income or Expense at the bottom of the 
report’s window to choose which one is displayed). To specify how you want 
QuickBooks to display your income or expenses, in the window’s icon bar, click 
By Account, By Customer, or By Class. You can’t change the time periods for 
each set of bars on the graph.
• What you’ve sold. Most companies analyze their sales to find ways to improve. 
Maybe you want to beef up sales to customers who haven’t bought from you 
in a while, turn good customers into great ones, or check how well your stuff 
is selling. The Sales by Customer Summary report (Reports→Sales→Sales by 
Customer Summary) is a terse listing of customers and how much you’ve sold 
to each one during the timeframe you specify; it initially shows values for this 
month to date.
The Sales Graph (Reports→Sales→Sales Graph), on the other hand, presents 
sales data in a cheery rainbow of colors, and you can quickly switch the graph 
to show the breakdown of sales by customer, item, or sales rep. The bar graph 
shows sales by month for the year to date. To change the duration covered by 
the graph, click Dates and then specify the date range you want. The pie chart 
shows sales based on the category you choose: In the window’s toolbar, click 
By Item, By Customer, or By Rep.
The Sales by Item Summary report (Reports→Sales→Sales by Item Summary) 
shows how much you sell of each item in your Item List, starting with inventory 
items, followed by Non-inventory Parts, Service items, and finally Other Charge 
items. This report also includes columns for average cost of goods sold (COGS) 
and gross margin, which apply only to inventory items you sell.
• Forecasting cash flow. Say you’re wondering whether you have any invoices due 
that will cover a big credit card bill that’s coming up, or whether income over the 
next few weeks is enough to meet payroll. At times like that, use the Cash Flow 
Forecast report (Reports→Company & Financial→Cash Flow Forecast) to see 
how much cash you should have over the next four weeks, as shown in Figure 
17-15. The Beginning Balance row shows the current balance for your Accounts 
Receivable, Accounts Payable, and bank accounts. The Proj Balance column 
shows how much money you should have in your bank accounts at the end of 
each week (or longer if you choose a different option in the Periods drop-down 
list). If a number in that column starts flirting with zero, you’re about to run out 
of cash. You’ll have to speed up some customer payments, transfer cash from 
another account, or look into a short-term loan.

Generating Tax Reports
Whether your accountant has the honor of preparing your taxes or you keep that 
excitement for yourself, you can save accountant’s fees and your own sanity by 
making sure your company file is ready for tax season. The key to a smooth transi­
tion from QuickBooks to tax preparation is linking each account in your chart of ac­
counts to the correct tax line and tax form. (The box on page 461 describes another 
tax-preparation task.)
Reviewing the Income Tax Preparation report (Reports→Accountant & Taxes→Income 
Tax Preparation) can save you money on accountant’s fees and prevent IRS penalties 
(as well as keep more of your hair attached to your scalp). As shown in Figure 17-16, 
this report lists the accounts in your chart of accounts and the tax lines to which 
you assigned them. If an account isn’t linked to the correct tax line—or worse, not 
assigned to any tax line—the Income Tax Summary report (described in a sec), which 
lists each line on your tax return with the amount you have to report, won’t display 
the correct values. See page 61 to learn more about choosing tax lines for accounts.
When all the accounts in your chart of accounts are assigned to tax lines, you can 
generate a report with all the values you need for your company’s tax return. Choose 
Reports→Accountant & Taxes→Income Tax Summary. Because you usually run this 
report after the fiscal year ends and all the numbers are in, QuickBooks automati­
cally chooses Last Tax Year in the Dates box.
 NOTE 	 As one last reminder of unassigned accounts, the last two lines of the Income Tax Summary report 
are “Tax Line Unassigned (balance sheet)” and “Tax Line Unassigned (income/expense).” To see the transactions 
that make up either of these unassigned values, double-click the number in the corresponding line.

Realized Gains and Losses
If you work with more than one currency (page 656), changes 
in exchange rates can lead to gains or losses on your transac-
tions. Say you send a customer an invoice for €1,000 when the 
euro-to-dollar exchange rate is 1.459 (that is, 1 euro equals 
1.459 dollars). The invoice total in your home currency (dollars, 
in this example) is $1,459. However, by the time you deposit 
the customer’s payment, the euro-to-dollar exchange rate is 
1.325, which means each euro is worth fewer dollars. At that 
exchange rate, your bank records a deposit of $1,325 in your 
account, and you’ve lost $134 on the transaction.
To see how much you’ve gained or lost on foreign currency trans-
actions, choose Reports→Company & Financial→Realized 
Gains & Losses. To see potential gains or losses based on 
the latest exchange rate, choose Reports→Company & 
Financial→Unrealized Gains & Losses. In the Enter Exchange 
Rates dialog box, type the exchange rates you want to ap-
ply. When you click Continue, the Unrealized Gains & Losses 
report shows gains and losses for the balances in your AR 
and AP accounts.
To report your financial results accurately, you have to adjust 
the value of accounts set up in foreign currencies (page 59) 
based on the exchange rate as of the end date for the report. 
You can download the most recent exchange rates by choosing 
Company→Manage Currency→Download Latest Exchange 
Rates. Or, to find exchange rates for a given date, point your 
web browser to www.xe.com/ict. Then, in QuickBooks, choose 
Lists→Currency List and edit the currencies to reflect the 
exchange rates you found online.
To adjust account values, choose Company→Manage 
Currency→Home Currency Adjustment. In the Home Currency 
Adjustment window, select the date for the adjustment, and 
then pick the currency and the exchange rate you want to use. 
Click Calculate Adjustment, and customers and vendors who 
use that currency appear in the window’s table. Select the ones 
you want to adjust, and then click Save & Close.

Year-End Journal Entries
Journal entries run rampant at the end of the year. If your 
accountant makes journal entries for you or gives you instruc-
tions, you might be perfectly happy not knowing what these 
journal entries do. But if you go it alone, you need to know 
which journal entries to make.
For example, if you purchase fixed assets, you need to create 
a journal entry to handle depreciation. You might also create 
journal entries to record home-office expenses as owner’s 
contributions to your company. Chapter 16 covers some of the 
journal entries you might need and explains how to create 
them.
If you aren’t an accounting expert, don’t waste precious 
time trying to figure out your journal entry needs; the cost 
of an accountant’s or tax professional’s services is piddling 
in comparison. 
Sharing a Company File with Your 
Accountant
If you work with an accountant who uses QuickBooks, there are times when a tug-of-
war over your company file is inevitable. You want to perform your day-to-day book­
keeping, but your accountant wants to review your books, correct mistakes you’ve 
made, enter journal entries to prepare your books for end-of-quarter or end-of-year 
reports, and so on. QuickBooks has two ways for you and your accountant to share:
• With an accountant’s review copy, the two of you can stop squabbling because 
you each get your own copy of the company file. That way you can work on 
everyday bookkeeping tasks while your accountant tackles cleaning up earlier 
periods.
• The external accountant user is a superpowered user who can look at anything 
in your company file except sensitive customer information like credit card 
numbers. You set up an external accountant user in your company file for your 
accountant so he can log into your file, review every nook and cranny of your 
company’s data (with QuickBooks’ Client Data Review tool, which is designed 
specifically for accountants), make changes, and keep track of which changes 
are his and which are yours.
This section explains both of these approaches. The box on page 465 describes 
other ways you can collaborate with your accountant.
Creating an Accountant’s Review Copy
The secret to an accountant’s review copy is a cutoff date that QuickBooks calls 
the dividing date. Transactions before this date are fair game for your accountant, 
who can work on the accountant’s review copy in the comfort of his own office. 

Chapter 17: Performing Year-End Tasks 
463
SHARING A 
COMPANY FILE 
WITH YOUR 
ACCOUNTANT
Transactions after that date are under your command in your original company file. 
When your accountant sends a file with changes back to you, QuickBooks makes 
short work of merging his changes into your company file. 
You have to be in single-user mode to create an accountant’s copy. To switch to 
single-user mode, first make sure that everyone else is logged out of the company 
file, and then choose File→“Switch to Single-user Mode.” After that, creating an ac­
countant’s review copy is a lot like creating other kinds of copies of your company file:
 TIP 	 If you have a few dozen windows open and laid out just the way you want, there’s no need to gnash your 
teeth as QuickBooks closes all your windows to create the accountant’s copy. Before you create the accountant’s 
copy, save the current window arrangement so the program can reopen all those windows for you: Simply choose 
Edit→Preferences→Desktop View. On the My Preferences tab, choose the “Save current desktop” option, and 
then click OK to close the Preferences dialog box. After you create the accountant’s copy, close and then reopen 
your company file to restore your saved windows.
1.	 Choose File→Send Company File→Accountant’s Copy→Save File. Then, in 
the Save Accountant’s Copy dialog box (which automatically selects the 
Accountant’s Copy option), click Next.
If your accountant needs unrestricted access to the file, select the “Portable 
or Backup File” option instead and see page 503 to learn how to create those 
types of files.
2.	 On the “Set the dividing date” screen shown in Figure 17-17, choose the date 
when control over transactions changes hands. Click Next and then, in the 
message box about closing windows, click OK.
Use the Dividing Date drop-down list to choose the date you want as the divid­
ing line between your work and your accountant’s work. The upper part of the 
screen explains what each of you can do before and after the dividing date. (See 
the box on page 465 for more on accountant copy restrictions.) You can work 
on transactions after the dividing date, but only look at transactions before the 
dividing date. Your accountant, on the other hand, can work on transactions 
before the dividing date, but only look at transactions after the dividing date.
3.	 In the Save Accountant’s Copy dialog box, choose the folder or drive where 
you want to save the copy.
QuickBooks sets the “Save as type” box to “QuickBooks Accountant’s Copy 
Transfer Files (*.QBX)” and automatically names the file using the company file’s 
name followed by “Acct Transfer” and the date and time you created the file. 
(The extension .qbx stands for QuickBooks Accountant Transfer File.) You’re free 
to edit the filename. Accountant’s review copies use the QuickBooks portable 
file format, so they’re usually small enough to email or save to a USB thumb 
drive. For example, a 20-megabyte company file may shrink to an accountant’s 
review copy that’s less than 2 MB.

The dividing date you use 
is often the end of a fiscal 
period. 
The Dividing Date drop-
down list gives you only 
a few choices: End of Last 
Month, 2 Weeks Ago, and 
4 Weeks Ago. If none of 
those options is what you 
want, you can specify a 
date by choosing Custom 
and then typing or choos-
ing the date in the box 
that appears.
4.	 To create the accountant’s review copy, click Save.
Once you create an accountant’s copy, QuickBooks reminds you that it exists: In 
the QuickBooks program window’s title bar, you’ll see the words “Accountant’s 
Changes Pending” immediately after the company name.
5.	 Send the file to your accountant.
Email the file to your accountant, or copy it to a CD or a USB thumb drive and 
send it to him. If you use a password on your company file (an excellent idea, 
no matter how tiny your company is—see page 723), don’t forget to tell your 
accountant the password for the account you’ve set up for him.
 NOTE 	 If your accountant has access to Intuit’s Accountant’s Copy File Transfer Service, you can tell 
QuickBooks to create an accountant’s review copy and send it to your accountant (choose File→Send Company 
File→Accountant’s Copy→Send to Accountant); the copy goes up on a secure Intuit server, and your accountant 
gets an email notifying him that the file is waiting there. The only downside to this approach compared with 
sending the file yourself is that you have to wait until the file is transferred to the Intuit server before you can 
start working in QuickBooks again.

WORD TO THE WISE
Ways to Work with an Accountant
For most companies, QuickBooks is no substitute for an ac-
countant. As financial professionals, accountants have the 
inside track on how best to handle your business finances. 
In addition to (or instead of) giving your accountant a review 
copy of your company file, here are some other ways you can 
integrate your accountant’s advice into your company file:
• A backup or portable copy. You can give your accountant 
exclusive access to your company file by sending her 
a backup or portable copy (page 503) of it. When she 
finishes evaluating your books and making the changes 
she wants, you can either begin using the copy she 
sends back to you or make adjustments in your company 
file based on her recommendations. For example, your 
accountant can send you a document listing the journal 
entries you have to create to adjust your accounts along 
with copies of what your income statement and balance 
sheet should look like. After you create those journal 
entries, your company file contains all of your transactions 
and the adjustments she requested. You can confirm that 
you entered the journal entries correctly by making sure 
your financial reports match the ones she produced.
• Working onsite. An accountant can work on the company 
file right in your office with a login password from you 
(the external accountant user feature [page 467] gives 
your accountant special tools for working with your data). 
However, accountants are prone to doing things that 
require the company file to be in single-user mode, which 
might disrupt your day-to-day bookkeeping process.
• The paper method. If your accountant prefers to work with 
her own accounting system, you’ll have to print the lists 
and reports that she requires. Then, when she gives you 
a list of changes and journal entries, you’ll have to make 
those changes in your company file.
In addition to these options, QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise 
editions include a remote-access service, which lets your 
accountant access your QuickBooks company file over the 
Internet. Or you can use a remote-access service like those 
offered at www.mypc.com or www.logmein.com.
MERGING ACCOUNTANT CHANGES INTO YOUR COMPANY FILE
The company file your accountant sends back to you will have the file extension 
.qby instead of .qbx to indicate that it’s an accountant’s review copy import file. (Y 
follows X in the alphabet. Get it?) If you’ve imported data (like customer records) 
into QuickBooks before (page 132), the following steps should be familiar:
1.	 If your copy of the company file isn’t open, open it and back it up (page 491) 
before you import your accountant’s changes.
2.	 Choose File→Send Company File→Accountant’s Copy→Import Accoun­
tant’s Changes from File. In the Import Accountant’s Changes dialog box, 
navigate to the disk or folder that contains the accountant’s file, and then 
double-click the filename.
QuickBooks displays the changes your accountant made, as shown in Figure 
17-18. Click the Expand All button to see the entire list. Review the changes to 
see if any of them conflict with work that you’ve done while your accountant 
worked on the copy. Each change comes with an explanation of how to deal 
with these conflicts.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Bookkeeping During Accountant’s Review
Are there any limitations I should know about before I create 
an accountant’s review copy?
QuickBooks locks parts of your company file when an accoun-
tant’s review copy exists, so both you and your accountant 
have to live with a few minor restrictions. Fortunately, most 
of the taboo tasks can wait during the few weeks that your 
accountant has a copy of your file.
While you and your accountant are working on your respective 
copies of the company file, you can work on transactions after 
the dividing date, so your bookkeeping duties are unaffected. 
You can also add entries to lists or edit the information in list 
entries, but you can’t merge or delete list entries until after 
you import your accountant’s changes. Similarly, you can add 
accounts, but you can’t edit, merge, or deactivate accounts. 
Adding subaccounts is a no-no, too.
With a few restrictions, your accountant can work on transac-
tions dated on or before the dividing date, whether she’s 
adding, editing, voiding, or deleting transactions. However, 
payroll, non-posting transactions (like estimates), transfers, 
sales tax payments, and inventory assemblies are completely 
off limits to her. Because the limitations vary depending on 
what your accountant is trying to do, QuickBooks highlights 
fields in an accountant’s copy to show the changes she can 
make that go back to you. (Fields that aren’t sent back to you 
aren’t highlighted.)
Your accountant can reconcile periods that end before the 
dividing date or change the cleared status of these earlier 
transactions. She can also add accounts to the chart of ac-
counts and add items to some lists. For example, she can add 
customers, vendors, items, classes, fixed assets, sales tax 
codes, employees, and other names. Whether she can edit, 
inactivate, merge, and delete list items depends on the list. 
However, even if she can’t edit them all, your accountant can 
still view all your QuickBooks lists.

CANCELING AN ACCOUNTANT’S REVIEW COPY
From time to time, you might want to get rid of an accountant’s review copy without 
importing any of the changes. For instance, say you created an accountant’s review 
copy by mistake or your accountant had so few changes that she simply told you 
what tweaks to make. Unlocking your company file so you can get back to perform­
ing any type of task requires nothing more than choosing File→Send Company 
File→Accountant’s Copy→Remove Restrictions. The Remove Restrictions dialog 
box warns you that you won’t be able to import changes from the accountant’s 
review copy if you remove restrictions. To show that you know what you’re doing, 
turn on the “Yes, I want to remove the Accountant’s Copy restrictions” checkbox, 
and then click OK. The words “Accountant’s Change Pending” disappear from the 
QuickBooks window’s title bar.
Setting Up an External Accountant User
QuickBooks’ external accountant user feature lets your accountant peruse your 
bookkeeping data and make changes while protecting your customers’ sensitive 
financial info. When your accountant logs in as this user, she can use the Client Data 
Review tool to look for problems and clean up any she finds. For example, she can 
look at the changes you’ve made to lists like the Chart of Accounts and Item List, 
scan your company file for payments or credits you haven’t applied, and find sales 
taxes or payroll liabilities you didn’t record correctly.
 NOTE 	 An external accountant user lets an accountant use the Client Data Review tool from within clients’ 
editions of QuickBooks. When someone logs in as an external accountant user, the Client Data Review item appears 
in the Company menu in any QuickBooks edition, including Pro and Premier.
Here’s how to set up an external accountant user:
1.	 Log into your company file as the administrator (page 718).
Only an administrator can create an external accountant user (who can perform 
tasks that even someone with administrator privileges can’t, like run the Client 
Data Review tool).

and password if you want to, and then click Next. On the “Access for user” screen, select the External Accountant 
option, click Next, click Yes, and then click Finish.
1099s
In QuickBooks, paying independent contractors is no different from paying other 
vendors: You enter bills from your contractors, and then pay those bills. But at the 
end of the year, you have to generate 1099s for your independent workers.
If you set up QuickBooks to track 1099 payments (page 668) and designate your 
contractors as 1099 vendors (page 85), generating 1099s is a piece of cake. But 
before you push a stack of 1099 forms through your printer, it’s a good idea to make 
sure your records are up to date and accurate; this section explains how to do that.
 NOTE 	 If you turn on the preference for QuickBooks payroll, then you can print W-2s for your employees

Generating 1099 Reports
To review the amounts you’ve paid to 1099 vendors, choose Reports→Vendors & 
Payables, and then select either of the following reports:

Chapter 17: Performing Year-End Tasks 
469
1099S
• 1099 Summary. This report includes each vendor you’ve set up as a 1099 vendor 
and the total amount you’ve paid each one. If any amount looks questionable, 
double-click it to display that vendor’s transactions. Although this report lists 
only the vendors you set up as eligible for 1099 status, as shown in Figure 17-19, 
you can modify it to make sure you haven’t left out any 1099 vendors. To do so, 
in the first 1099 Options drop-down list, choose “All vendors.”
FIGURE 17-19
Regardless of the fiscal 
year you use for your 
company, payroll and 1099 
tasks run on a calendar 
year, because your em-
ployees and subcontractors 
pay taxes for each calen-
dar year. That’s why the 
Dates drop-down list for 
the 1099 Summary report 
includes calendar-year 
date ranges.
If the 1099 Summary report is empty, your 1099 account mappings may be 
missing. In the report window’s toolbar, in the middle drop-down list, choose 
“All allowed accounts,” and then click Refresh to see payments you made to 
1099 vendors regardless of the account. If your vendors leap into view, you 
need to map your accounts to 1099 boxes, as described in step 6 on page 471.
 NOTE 	 The federal government gives you the tiniest of breaks by setting thresholds for total payments 
to 1099 vendors. If you pay vendors less than the threshold, you don’t have to generate 1099s for them. (For 
nonemployee compensation, the 2014 threshold is $600.)
In the 1099 Summary report’s window, QuickBooks sets the last box in the 1099 
Options row to “Use thresholds.” This choice filters the vendors in the report to 
those that exceed the government’s threshold (see the preceding Note). If you 
want to see all your 1099 vendors, regardless of what you paid them, choose 
“Ignore thresholds” here instead.
• 1099 Detail. If you pay your independent contractors on a regular schedule, 
this report can pinpoint errors because it shows the transactions that produce 
vendors’ 1099 amounts. If you see a gap in the payment schedule or two 
transactions in the same month, double-click a transaction amount to open the 
corresponding window, such as Write Checks.

Printing 1099-MISC Forms
The steps to start printing 1099 forms are simple but, as with any printing task, 
fraught with niggling details:
1.	 Order printable 1099-MISC and 1096 forms or purchase them at your local 
business supply store.
1099-MISC and 1096 forms use special ink so that government agencies can 
scan them. Intuit sells kits with preprinted 1099 forms. In your web browser, go 
to http://intuitmarket.intuit.com. In that page’s horizontal navigation bar, point 
your cursor at Tax Forms, and then click 1099 Kits.
You can also order 1099 forms directly from the IRS by going to www.irs.gov 
and clicking the Forms & Pubs heading. On the “Forms and Publications” page, 
click Order Forms & Pubs, and then click Employer and Information Returns. 
In the value box for the 1099-MISC form (about halfway down the list), type 
the quantity of forms you need, and then scroll to the bottom of the page and 
click “Add to Cart.”
 NOTE 	 You can print 1099-MISC forms for up to 249 vendors. If you’ve got more than that, the IRS requires you 
to file 1099 forms electronically. In that case, bypass printing the forms in QuickBooks and use the government’s 
hopefully easy-to-use system instead.
2.	 Load your printer with preprinted 1099-MISC forms.
If you use a printer that feeds individual sheets, don’t bother placing a Copy 
2 form after each Copy 1 form so that you can print multiple copies for each 
vendor. It’s a lot easier to load the Copy 1 sheets and print a set of 1099 forms 
on those sheets, and then load the Copy 2 forms and print a second set of 1099 
forms. You then send the Copy 1 sheets to the 1099 vendors and the Copy 2 
sheets to the government in one big batch.
3.	 Choose Vendors→Print/E-file 1099s→1099 Wizard. In the QuickBooks 1099 
Wizard window that opens, click Get Started.
The QuickBooks 1099 wizard helps verify your 1099 information before you print. 
After you click Get Started, the “Select your 1099 vendors” screen appears.
4.	 To transform a vendor into a 1099 vendor, turn on the checkbox in the ven­
dor’s Create Form 1099-MISC Column. When you’ve selected all the 1099 
vendors, click Continue.
Turn off a vendor’s checkbox if you don’t need to create a 1099 for him.
5.	 On the “Verify your 1099 vendors’ information” screen, make any necessary 
changes to the vendors’ tax ID, name, address, and phone number. When 
the information is correct, click Continue.
If required information is missing, the wizard outlines the table cell in red. Simply 
click the cell and type in the needed info.

Chapter 17: Performing Year-End Tasks 
471
1099S
6.	 On the “Map vendor payment accounts” screen, map the accounts in your 
chart of accounts to the appropriate box on the 1099 form by clicking the 
down arrow in the “Apply payments to this 1099 box” cell and then choosing 
the appropriate 1099 box. When you’re done, click Continue.
Most payments to 1099 vendors are mapped to Box 7: Nonemployee Com­
pensation, which is why this screen includes a “Report all payments in Box 7” 
checkbox. To map all your 1099 vendors to Box 7, simply turn on this setting.
7.	 On the “Review payments for exclusions” screen, click View Included Pay­
ments to see payments you made to vendors by credit card, debit card, gift 
card, or PayPal. If any payments made with those payment types appear in 
the “Check Payments Included on Forms 1099-MISC” report, double-click 
the transaction to open the Write Checks window. In the No. field, fill in the 
payment type, such as Debit, Visa, Giftcard, or PayPal.
Ever since the 2011 tax year, the IRS has required you to exclude payments you 
made by credit card, debit card, gift card, or third-party payment networks 
such as PayPal from Form 1099-MISC because they’re reported by the card 
issuers and third-party payment networks on Form 1099-K. You can click View 
Excluded Payments to see which payments QuickBooks has excluded from Form 
1099-MISC. If you make a payment in the Write Checks or Pay Bills windows, 
you can fill in the No. field with the payment type (up to eight characters) so 
that QuickBooks can automatically exclude that payment from Form 1099-MISC.
8.	 When the “Check Payments Included on Forms 1099-MISC” report shows 
only check payments, click Continue.
After you edit transactions, click Refresh in the report window to view an up­
dated report.
9.	 On the “Confirm your 1099 entries” screen, review the vendors and their 
compensation to make sure it’s correct, and then click Continue.
10.	 On the “Choose a filing method” screen, click Print 1099s.
If you file more than 249 forms, you have to e-file your 1099s. In that case, you 
can click “Go to Intuit 1099 E-File Service” to use Intuit’s e-file service (which 
costs extra).
11.	 In the “Printing 1099-MISC and 1096 Forms” dialog box, click OK.
QuickBooks opens the “Select 1099s to Print” dialog box shown in Figure 17-20 
and automatically selects every vendor whose pay exceeds the government 
threshold (page 469).
12.	 When the Valid ID and Valid Address columns are replete with the word Yes, 
click Preview 1099 to see the final forms before you print them.
In the Print Preview window, click Zoom In (if necessary) to verify the informa­
tion. When you’ve reviewed the forms, click Close.

CLOSING THE 
BOOKS FOR 
THE YEAR
FIGURE 17-20
In addition to columns for the 
vendors’ names and total pay, 
this table also includes the Valid 
ID and Valid Address columns. If 
you tend to create vendors on the 
fly without bothering to enter 
pesky details like their tax ID 
numbers or street addresses, scan 
these columns for the word “No.” 
If you see it in any cell, click Can-
cel, and then edit your vendors 
to add this essential information. 
Then repeat steps 10 and 11 and 
verify that all the Valid ID and 
Valid Address cells say Yes.
13.	 Click Print 1099.
QuickBooks opens the Print 1099 window. If the preprinted forms are waiting 
in a printer other than the one that the program chose, in the “Printer name” 
box, select the printer that holds your preprinted forms.
14.	 Click Print.
 TIP 	 Preprinted forms usually include Copy 1 for the vendor and Copy 2 for the government, but you’ll also 
want a copy for your files. Instead of printing a third set of 1099s, run one of the printed sets through your copy 
machine or printer/scanner/copier.
Closing the Books for the Year
A few months after the end of a fiscal year, when tax returns rest under the gimlet-
eyed scrutiny of the tax authorities, most companies close their books for the pre­
vious fiscal year. Doing so locks the transactions that you’ve already reported on 
tax returns or in financial results, because the IRS and shareholders alike don’t look 
kindly on changes to the reports they’ve received.
QuickBooks, on the other hand, doesn’t care whether you close the books in your 
company file. The closing task is mainly to protect you from the consequences of 
changing the numbers in previous years (like altering the company file so that it no 
longer matches what you reported to the IRS). But you’re free to keep your books 
open if you’re not worried about editing older transactions by mistake.

Chapter 17: Performing Year-End Tasks 
473
CLOSING THE 
BOOKS FOR 
THE YEAR
If you do close your books in QuickBooks, you can still edit transactions prior to the 
closing date. Unlike other bookkeeping programs in which closed means closed, in 
QuickBooks, folks who know the closing-date password can still change and delete 
closed transactions to, say, correct an egregious error before you rerun your end-
of-year reports.
Closing the books in QuickBooks takes place in the Preferences dialog box. Switch 
to single-user mode (page 489), and then choose Edit→Preferences→Accounting 
and click the Company Preferences tab. To close the books as of a specific date, click 
the Set Date/Password button. Figure 17-21 shows what to do next.
FIGURE 17-21
In the Closing Date box, 
type or select the last day 
of the previous fiscal year. 
If you want to let only 
authorized people make 
changes to the closed 
books, type a password in 
the Closing Date Password 
box. Then press Tab and, 
in the Confirm Password 
box, type the password a 
second time.
 TIP 	 Don’t cut and paste the password from the Closing Date Password box to the Confirm Password box. These 
boxes display dots instead of the actual characters, which means you can’t see typos. So if you set a password 
with a typo in it, you’ll be unlikely to stumble on the correct password, and your closed books will remain shut 
as tight as a clam.
After you’ve set a password for the closing date, you’ll have to enter that password 
whenever you want to modify transactions prior to that date. For example, if you 
try to edit a check that you wrote before the closing date, QuickBooks opens a 
message box with a Password field in it. Type the closing-date password, and then 
click OK to complete your edit.
 TIP 	 After you’ve completed all your year-end activities in QuickBooks, create a backup of your company file 
(page 491). With all the data that contributed to your financial reports and tax forms in this backup, it wouldn’t 
be overkill to create two copies of it: one to keep close by in your office and one stored safely offsite in case of 
disaster.

A
ttention to detail. Follow-through. These are a couple of the things that keep 
customers coming back for more. Following through on promises and call­
ing to check that an issue was resolved successfully is good business. But 
sending reorder brochures after customers have already made purchases can just 
make them mad. In addition, paying a bill late can result in a whopping late fee. 
Conversely, you can leave money on the table if you don’t take advantage of early 
payment discounts.
If you use other programs for managing customer relationships and keeping track 
of what you need to do, you can record these types of details there. But if you tend 
to work in QuickBooks all day long, the program has several features that can help 
you stay in customers’ and vendors’ good graces by tracking what’s been going on 
and what still needs to be done.
QuickBooks’ to-dos are preferable to papering the edges of your computer moni­
tor with sticky notes, although you might prefer to keep to-dos in a program that 
you keep running constantly, like your email or calendar program, so that you see 
reminders when you need them. This chapter kicks off by explaining how to create 
and manage to-dos in QuickBooks.
If you collect info about customers, vendors, and employees, QuickBooks’ notes 
feature can keep them close at hand. For instance, you could record one note to docu­
ment a customer’s problem with an order, and then record another note to document 
how he wants you to apply his credit. And if a note spawns an action item or two, 
you can create to-dos as you write up your comments. In this chapter, you’ll learn 
how to create and manage notes, and how to create new to-dos at the same time.

Financial Tasks

TRACKING 
TO-DOS
Finally, reminders about when to perform bookkeeping tasks can help prevent late 
fees and keep income rolling in. QuickBooks’ reminders prod you into action when 
it’s time to send invoices, pay bills, reorder inventory, and so on. You can even 
create reminders for QuickBooks to-dos. This chapter shows you how to turn on 
reminders for the activities you don’t want to forget, and how to tell QuickBooks 
when to remind you. You’ll also learn how to use the Calendar window to see when 
transactions and to-dos are due.
Tracking To-Dos
QuickBooks can help you track business to-dos like phone calls to make, emails to 
send, meetings and appointments to attend, and tasks to complete. You can create 
to-dos for customers, leads who aren’t yet customers, vendors, employees, or just 
for yourself. This section shows you how to create and keep track of to-dos.
Creating a To-Do
QuickBooks gives you several ways to open the Add To Do dialog box so you can 
create to-dos:
• In the Customer, Vendor, or Employee Center, select a customer, job, vendor, 
or employee, and then click the To Do’s tab at the bottom of the center’s window. 
Then click Manage To Do’s→Create New.
• In the Lead Center, select a lead and then, on the To Do’s tab at the bottom of 
the center’s window, click the To Do button.
• In the To Do List window (which you open by choosing Company→To Do 
List), click the To Do button at the window’s bottom left (shown in Figure 18-1, 
background).
Once the Add To Do dialog box is open, follow these steps:
1.	 In the Type drop-down list, choose the kind of to-do you want to create.
To-dos can be calls, faxes, emails, meetings, appointments, or tasks.
2.	 In the Priority box, choose High, Medium, or Low.
Assigning a priority is a good way to keep track of your most important to-
dos. In the To Do List window, you can sort your to-dos by any field, including 
Priority, as described on page 481.
3.	 If the to-do is associated with someone, turn on the With checkbox, and 
then specify whom it involves.
In the drop-down list below the checkbox, choose Lead, Customer, Vendor, or 
Employee. Then, in the drop-down list below that, choose the specific lead, 
customer, vendor, or employee associated with the to-do, as shown in Figure 
18-1 (foreground).

Chapter 18: Keeping Track of Financial Tasks
479
TRACKING 
TO-DOS
FIGURE 18-1
If a to-do is a task or com-
munication with someone, 
turn on the With checkbox 
(circled), and then specify 
the person or company it’s 
connected to. 
However, a to-do doesn’t 
have to be associated with 
anyone. For example, you 
may just want a reminder 
to submit your quar-
terly income tax form. In a 
situation like that, simply 
leave the With checkbox 
turned off.
4.	 Specify the due date and time.
In the Due box, QuickBooks automatically selects today’s date, so be sure to 
choose the date by which you want to complete this to-do. To specify a time, 
turn on the checkbox to the left of the first Time box, and then set the time. If 
you want to keep your records complete and record a to-do that you’ve already 
finished, choose a date in the past, and then choose Done in the Status box 
(which you’ll learn about in a sec).
5.	 In the Details box, type information about the to-do.
By filling in the Details box, you can remind yourself what you want to do or 
delegate the to-do to someone else.

TO-DOS
6.	 In the Status box, choose Active.
Active represents to-dos that aren’t complete yet. Later on, you can edit the 
to-do and change its status to Done when the task is complete, or to Inactive 
if you no longer need to perform the task.
7.	 Click OK to save the to-do.
It appears in the To Do List window, which includes all the to-dos you create.
 TIP 	 To see just the to-dos for a specific person or company, open the Customer, Lead, Vendor, or Employee 
center. There, select the customer, lead, vendor, or employee you’re interested in, and then click the To Do’s tab 
at the bottom of the window.
Editing a To-Do
The To Do List window (Figure 18-2) is your one-stop shop for editing to-dos, whether 
you created them for customers, leads, vendors, or employees. Open this window 
by choosing Company→To Do List. Then double-click the to-do you want to edit. 
The fields in the Edit To Do dialog box that opens are the same as the ones in the 
Add To Do dialog box. Simply make whatever changes you want, and then click OK.
FIGURE 18-2
You can view or edit 
to-dos in this window. 
Double-click a to-do to 
edit it, or view specific 
to-dos by choosing a value 
from the Type, Status, 
With, or Date drop-down 
list. 
To sort the table by a field, 
click the field’s name 
(Due Date, for example) 
in the table’s header row. 
An up arrow appears to 
the field’s right as shown 
here because QuickBooks 
initially sorts in ascending 
order. Click the arrow to 
sort in descending order.
To delete a to-do, first click it in the To Do List window’s table. Then, at the bottom 
of the window, click the down arrow to the To Do button’s right, and then choose 
Delete Selected To Do. Or, in the Customer, Vendor, or Employee center, select a 
customer, job, vendor, or employee, and then click the To Do’s tab at the bottom of 

Chapter 18: Keeping Track of Financial Tasks
481
ADDING NOTES
the center’s window. Select the to-do that you want to delete, and then click Manage 
To Do’s→Delete Selected To Do. (In the Lead Center, select a lead and then, on the 
To Do’s tab at the bottom of the center’s window, click the To Do button and choose 
Delete Selected To Do.)
Viewing To-Dos
The To Do List window (Figure 18-2) shows all the to-dos you’ve created and lets 
you filter to-dos in several ways. For example, filtering by date is a great way to see 
what’s on deck for the next few days. Or you can filter by type to see all the calls 
you need to make. On the other hand, you could filter by name to review what’s 
going on with a customer before you meet with her.
You sort to-dos in the To Do List window by clicking a column heading, such as 
Priority, or filter the list by choosing entries in the drop-down lists at the top of the 
window:
• Filter by type. Click the Type box and then choose the kind of to-do you want 
to see, such as calls you need to make. Once you do that, the table displays 
only to-dos of that type.
• Filter by status. To focus on tasks that aren’t complete yet, in the Status drop-
down list, choose Active.
• Filter by category of names. To see to-dos for just leads, customers, vendors, 
or employees, choose a category in the With drop-down list.
• Filter by date. To see to-dos that are due during a specific time period, choose 
the period in the Date drop-down list.
 NOTE 	 To-dos also appear in the QuickBooks Calendar (page 486). And if you want the program to remind 
you about to-dos, you can set up reminders for them (page 483).
Adding Notes
You can add as many separate notes as you want to customers, leads, vendors, and 
employees. To view them, simply open the appropriate center (Customer Center, 
Vendor Center, and so on), select the record you want (customer, job, lead, vendor, 
or employee), and then click the Notes tab in the lower-right part of the window. 
All the notes for the selected record appear, as demonstrated with a customer in 
Figure 18-3 (background).
 TIP 	 New in QuickBooks 2015, you can pin one of the notes in the Customer Center’s Notes tab so that it appears 
in the Customer Information pane’s top right. (You can also pin notes in the Vendor and Employee centers.) When 
you create your first note for a record, QuickBooks automatically pins it. If you create more notes and want to pin 
a different note, then on the window’s Notes tab, click the note’s Pinned cell (labeled in Figure 18-3). When you 
do that, QuickBooks deselects the previous pinned note (if there was one).

Click a note’s Pinned cell 
(labeled here) to make 
the note appear in the 
top right of the Customer 
Information pane (not 
shown here).
On a center’s Notes tab, you can add, edit, and delete notes in the same way you 
work with to-dos (page 478):
• Add a note. With a record selected, on the Notes tab, click Manage Notes→Add 
New. The Notepad dialog box opens with the record’s contact information filled 
in as shown in Figure 18-3 (foreground). To keep track of when conversations 
happen, click Date/Time Stamp before you start typing. If you’re adding a note 
about something that happened on a day other than today, you have to type 
in the date.
• Edit a note. Select the note you want to edit, and then click Manage Notes→Edit 
Selected Note.
• Delete a note. Select the note you want to delete, and then click Manage 
Notes→Delete Selected Note.
The Notes tab displays all the notes you’ve added for the selected record. To limit 
the notes to a date range, click the Date box and choose the time period you want, 
such as “This Month-to-date.”

REMINDERS
Reminders
QuickBooks reminds you when to perform many accounting and business tasks so 
you can save your brain cells for remembering more important things—like your 
anniversary. Even if your brain is the size of a small planet, you’re likely to rely on 
QuickBooks’ reminders to nudge you when it’s time to print checks, print or email 
invoices, remind your customers to pay overdue invoices, deposit payments, and 
so on. And when you turn on reminders for to-dos, the program can give you hints 
about any task that you don’t want to forget, whether it’s for a customer, vendor, 
employee, or yourself.
To open the Reminders window, which got a makeover in QuickBooks 2015 and is 
shown in Figure 18-4, choose Company→Reminders. Alternatively, you can click the 
“View reminders” icon at the top right of the QuickBooks menu bar; the icon looks 
like an alarm clock and includes a flag that indicates how many reminders are wait­
ing for you. (See page 659 to learn how to make QuickBooks open the Reminders 
window every time you open a company file.) You can tell QuickBooks whether you 
want it to display summaries or individual reminders. A summary displays a head­
ing and the total amount of money for that category. With details, you see each 
transaction on a separate line.
 TIP 	 In the Reminders window, click the flippy triangle to the left of a heading to expand or collapse that 
section (that is, show or hide its individual reminders). These triangles are labeled in Figure 18-4.
FIGURE 18-4
The way information is 
displayed in this window 
depends on what settings 
you choose in QuickBooks’ 
Reminders preferences, 
shown in Figure 18-5. 
To adjust your preferences, 
click the Settings icon (the 
gear) labeled here, or 
choose Edit→Preferences 
→Reminders.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
484
REMINDERS
Out of the box, QuickBooks automatically sets every kind of reminder to show a 
summary, but you can tell the program what you want reminders for and when you 
want to be reminded. To customize your reminders, in the Reminders window, click 
the Settings icon (it looks like a gear), or choose Edit→Preferences→Reminders, and 
then click the Company Preferences tab. (Reminders settings apply to everyone who 
logs into the company file, and you need administrator privileges to change them.)
As shown in Figure 18-5, you can specify the level of detail for each type of reminder 
and, in some cases, when you want QuickBooks to remind you. The Show Summary 
options tell QuickBooks to display a single reminder and the total amount of money 
in the Reminders window, like the Overdue Invoices row in Figure 18-4. The Show 
List options display each transaction on a separate line instead, as shown below 
the “Bills to Pay” heading in Figure 18-4; in that example, QuickBooks displays one 
line with the total amount of bills to pay, followed by a line showing each payment.
FIGURE 18-5
You can choose how and when 
QuickBooks reminds you to order 
inventory, pay bills, and so on. 
For transactions like bills that 
require action by a specific date, 
you can tell QuickBooks how far 
in advance to remind you. 
If you don’t want a reminder for 
a specific type of transaction, 
choose the Don’t Remind Me 
option.
 NOTE 	 You can set up reminders only if you’ve turned on the corresponding feature. For example, if you 
don’t use QuickBooks inventory, the “Inventory to Reorder” reminder preference is dimmed.
QuickBooks can generate reminders for the following transactions:
• Checks to Print. This reminder tells you that you’ve got checks queued up to 
print. (You add checks to the queue by turning on the Print Later checkbox in 
the Write Checks window [page 203].) You can also specify how many days’ 
notice you want before the date you entered to print the checks.
• Paychecks to Print. This reminder tells you that paychecks are waiting to be 
printed. You can specify how many days’ notice you want before the payroll 
date you entered.

Chapter 18: Keeping Track of Financial Tasks
485
REMINDERS
• Invoices/Credit Memos to Print. To print invoices or credit memos in batches, 
as described on page 313, in the Create Invoices window, turn on the Print Later 
checkbox. This reminder notifies you about unprinted invoices or credit memos. 
You can specify how many days’ notice you want before the invoice or credit 
memo date you entered.
• Overdue Invoices. This reminder warns you about invoices that have passed 
their due dates with no payment from the customer. You can specify how many 
days overdue an invoice needs to be before QuickBooks reminds you.
• Almost Due Invoices. This reminder tells you about invoices that are due soon. 
QuickBooks automatically selects the Show Summary option for this reminder, 
and you can’t change it. However, you can change the number of days before 
the due date.
• Sales Receipts to Print. If you queued up sales receipts to print as a batch 
(page 313), this is the reminder about printing them. QuickBooks reminds you 
as soon as you have any sales receipts to print.
• Sales Orders to Print. This preference is available only if you use QuickBooks 
Premier or Enterprise. It reminds you to print sales orders you’ve queued up.
• Inventory to Reorder. When you create Inventory Part items in QuickBooks, 
you can set a reminder for when you need to reorder inventory (page 521). 
This reminder warns you when a sales form you create reduces the number of 
items on hand below your reorder point. (QuickBooks generates a reminder 
immediately.)
• Assembly Items to Build. This preference is available only if you use QuickBooks 
Premier or Enterprise. It warns you when the quantity of assembled items drops 
below your build point (page 523).
• Bills to Pay. This reminder nudges you about bills you have to pay. (Entering 
bills is described on page 184.) You can specify how many days’ notice you want 
before the date the bills are due.
• Memorized Transactions Due. When you memorize transactions, you can 
specify a date for the next occurrence (page 324). This reminder tells you about 
recurring memorized transactions. You can specify how many days’ notice you 
want before the next scheduled occurrence.
• Money to Deposit. When you receive payments, you can group them with 
other undeposited funds so you aren’t running to the bank every five minutes as 
checks pour in. If you want to put your money to work as soon as possible, turn 
on this checkbox to receive a reminder whenever you have any funds to deposit.
• Purchase Orders to Print. This reminder gives you a prod about purchase 
orders you haven’t yet printed.
• To Do Notes. To-do items can include dates, as described on page 479. This 
reminder shows you when to-do items are due.

The Calendar window (Figure 18-6) acts as a dashboard that shows when transac­
tions and to-dos were entered or are due. To open it, choose Company→Calendar, 
or click the Calendar icon on the icon bar or in the Home Page’s Company panel.
 NOTE 	 Unfortunately, there’s no way to exchange the to-dos and transactions on this calendar with an 
external calendar like Google Calendar or the one in Microsoft Outlook. To see QuickBooks to-dos and transactions 
on a calendar, you have to launch QuickBooks and open the Calendar window.
FIGURE 18-6
Each square shows what

CALENDAR
 NOTE 	 The Calendar window’s toolbar includes icons and boxes for controlling your view. Here’s what they 
do from left to right: Click a blue arrow to move to the previous or next time period. Click Today to select the 
square for today’s date. Click the icons to display one day, one week, or one month, from left to right. Use the 
Show drop-down list to pick the transactions you want to see in the calendar.
Out of the box, the Calendar window has three panes:
• The calendar initially displays an entire month. Each square in the calendar 
summarizes the transactions and to-dos for that day, as shown in Figure 18-6. 
For example, click a given day, and you see the to-dos and transactions due on 
that day. Double-click a to-do to open it in the Edit To Do dialog box, or double-
click a transaction to open it in its corresponding window (Create Invoices for 
an invoice, for example).
 TIP 	 To see more detail in the calendar, switch to a weekly or even a daily view. At the top of the window, 
click the first button to the right of the Today button to display a single day in the calendar pane. The daily view 
shows transactions and to-dos for a day, similar to what you see in the bottom pane of the Calendar. Click the 
second button to display a weekly view.
• The Upcoming and Due pane on the right lists the to-dos and transactions that 
are on deck or past due as of today, which is incredibly handy for staying on 
top of your bookkeeping and business activities. Double-click a to-do to open 
the Edit To Do dialog box with the details about what you’re supposed to do 
and when. Double-click a transaction to open it in its corresponding window.
• The activity pane at the bottom of the window lists the to-dos and transac­
tions that were entered or are due on the date you select in the calendar. The 
customer’s telephone number is listed for invoices, which is handy if you want 
to call and find out when you can expect a payment. If a day is particularly busy, 
you can expand this pane by pointing your cursor at the three blue dots at the 
top of the pane and then dragging.
 NOTE 	 To hide the “Upcoming and Due” pane, click the right arrow on its left edge; to restore this pane, 
click the left arrow on the Calendar pane’s right edge. To collapse the activity pane, click the up arrow at its top 
right; to expand the pane, click the down arrow. If you click the Daily View button at the top of the window (put 
your cursor over each button to see a tooltip with the button’s name), the calendar disappears; to restore the 
calendar, click the Weekly View or Monthly View button.

CHAPTER
19
W
hen company ledgers were made of paper, you had to be careful not to tear 
the pages or spill coffee on them. Today’s electronic books require their 
own sort of care. Protecting your QuickBooks files is essential, not only 
because they tell the financial story of your company, but also because computers 
are notorious for chewing up data in all sorts of ways.
QuickBooks files have a few advantages over their paper-based relatives. Most im­
portantly, you can easily make copies of them for safekeeping. (QuickBooks can also 
create a special copy of your company file so you and your accountant can both work 
on it at the end of the year; see page 462 for details.) If several people work on your 
company file simultaneously, you’ll learn when and how to switch from multi-user 
mode to single-user mode so you can perform the housekeeping tasks that require 
dedicated access. This chapter focuses on the most important things you can do 
with your QuickBooks files: back them up and copy them. It also explains why and 
how to verify, condense, and delete your files, which you’ll do less often—if ever.
Switching Between Multi- and Single-User 
Mode
In QuickBooks, some maintenance tasks require that only one person have ac­
cess to the company file. So if you told QuickBooks to set up your company file in 
multi-user mode when you created it, you have to switch to single-user mode for 
the following tasks:
	 	
Managing

SWITCHING 
BETWEEN 
MULTI- AND 
SINGLE-USER 
MODE
• Merge or delete accounts and items.
• Set up some aspects of your company file, such as finance charges.
• Condense or export data.
• Save an accountant’s copy of your company file (although you can open or 
convert an existing accountant’s copy while in multi-user mode).
 TIP 	 You can verify data (page 507) while in multi-user mode, although the verification isn’t as rigorous as 
the one performed while in single-user mode. Being in single-user mode can also speed up time-consuming 
tasks like running humongous reports.
To see which mode your company file is currently in, display QuickBooks’ File menu. 
If you see “Switch to Multi-user Mode” on the menu, you’re in single-user mode. If 
you see “Switch to Single-user Mode” instead, you’re in multi-user mode. (The box 
on page 491 explains how to quickly close a file that’s in multi-user mode.)
The good news is that you don’t have to remember which tasks demand single-user 
mode; QuickBooks reminds you to switch modes if you try to perform a single-user-
mode task when the company file is chugging away in multi-user mode. Because 
everyone else has to close the company file before you can switch it to single-user 
mode, you may find it easiest to wait until no one else is working on the company 
file (early in the morning or after business hours, say).
Here’s how you switch from multi-user mode to single-user mode:
1.	 If your single-user task can’t wait until off hours, ask everyone else to close 
the company file you want to work on.
They can choose File→Close Company/Logoff or simply exit QuickBooks to 
close the company file.
2.	 When everyone else has closed the company file, open it in QuickBooks by 
choosing File→Open Previous Company, and then selecting the company 
file in the submenu.
If the company file doesn’t appear on the Open Previous File submenu, choose 
File→“Open or Restore Company” instead. In the “Open or Restore Company” 
dialog box, select the “Open a company file” option, and then click Next. In the 
“Open a Company” dialog box that appears, navigate to the folder where you 
store the file, and then double-click its filename.
3.	 Choose File→“Switch to Single-user Mode.” In the message box that ap­
pears telling you the file is in single-user mode, click OK.
QuickBooks closes all open windows before it switches to single-user mode. 
After you click OK, it reopens the windows from the previously saved desktop 
(page 644), and you’re ready to work solo on the company file.

Chapter 19: Managing QuickBooks Files

BACKING UP 
FILES
4.	 After you finish your single-user task, switch back to multi-user mode by 
choosing File→“Switch to Multi-user Mode.” When the message box appears 
telling you the file is in multi-user mode, click OK.
You’ll see all the windows in QuickBooks close. After you click OK, the previously 
saved desktop’s windows open, and the company file is back in multi-user mode.
Don’t forget to tell your colleagues that they can log back into the company file.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Closing a File in Multi-User Mode—Stat!
Say your IT department is ready to shut down your company’s 
servers for a long-awaited maintenance update. But a couple of 
your accounting folks went home without logging out of your 
company file. Shutting down that server while your company 
file is open is asking for trouble. Fortunately, in QuickBooks 
2015, an administrator user can now close a company file even 
if people are still logged into it.
If you’re an administrator user, here’s what you do:
1.	 In your computer’s system tray, click the QuickBooks 
Messenger icon (it looks like a stylized person with a 
green callout at its top right).
2.	 In the QuickBooks Messenger window that opens, click 
the Actions down arrow, and then choose Close Com-
pany Files for Users. 
3.	 In the Close Company Files for Users dialog box, select the 
users whose company files you want to close.
4.	 If it’s truly an emergency, below the “Select users” list, 
turn on the “Close even if users have unsaved data” 
checkbox.
5.	 Click the Close Company File button.
QuickBooks closes the company files that are open and discards 
any unsaved data if you chose that setting.
Backing Up Files
If you already have a backup procedure for all your computer files, QuickBooks’ 
Backup feature might seem about as useful as your appendix. Your company-wide 
backups regularly squirrel your data files away in a safe place, ready to rescue you 
should disaster strike. Still, QuickBooks’ Backup feature complements even the 
most robust backup plan. And if you run a mom-and-pop business, online backups 
let you back up all your data without hiring an IT staff. Here are some ways you can 
put the program’s Backup feature to work:
• Back up one QuickBooks company file. Before you experiment with a new 
QuickBooks feature or perform a data-changing task like condensing your 
company file, you don’t want to back up all your data—just the company file. 
That way, if the experiment goes wrong, you can restore the backup and try 
a different approach. You can also call on QuickBooks Backup when you’ve 
worked hard on your company file (pasting hundreds of inventory items into it 
from Excel, say) and the thought of losing that work makes you queasy. In both 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
492
BACKING UP 
FILES
of these situations, running a QuickBooks manual backup (page 495) creates 
a backup file immediately.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks backup files aren’t merely copies of your company files—they’re compressed versions 
that take up less space (about 20 to 25 percent less, depending on what you store in your company file).
• Schedule backups of your QuickBooks data. If you have trouble remembering 
to back up your work, QuickBooks’ scheduled and automatic backups can help. 
You can set the program to automatically back up a company file after you’ve 
opened it a certain number of times. That way, if you mangle your data or it 
gets corrupted in some way, you can use one of these backups to recover. The 
program can also create company-file backups automatically according to the 
schedule you specify—Tuesdays through Saturdays at 2:00 a.m., for example.
• Back up your data online. Online backups are a handy alternative to setting 
up your own backup plan (scheduling regular backups, rotating backup media, 
storing backups offsite, and so on). You can select which data you want to 
back up and when. That way, when QuickBooks creates the backups, they’re 
encrypted and stored at secure data centers managed by IT professionals. If 
you don’t have IT staff to back up your data and keep it secure, this method 
may be worth every penny. See the box on page 497 to learn more.
 TIP 	 Don’t use QuickBooks portable files as backups. Although these files are smaller and easier to send to 
others than standard company files, they don’t contain all the information that backup files do. For example, 
unlike backup files, portable files don’t contain ancillary files like letters, logos, images, and templates. They also 
don’t contain transaction logs, which Intuit Technical Support can use to help restore transactions if your file is 
damaged.
Whether you want to set up options for your backups, schedule backups, or run a 
backup immediately, you start by opening the Create Backup dialog box by choos­
ing File→Backup Company→Create Local Backup.
 NOTE 	 What and how often you back up are up to you (or your company’s system administrators). It depends 
on what information you can’t afford to lose and how much data you’re willing to recreate in case of a disaster. 
Most companies back up their data every night and also create additional backup copies daily or weekly to store 
offsite.
If you rely on your company-wide backups, consider testing their reliability at least once a year. Tell the IT folks 
that you’ve deleted your QuickBooks company file and see if they can provide you with a recent backup. (Then 
bring them donuts the next day as a thank-you.)
Choosing Standard Backup Settings
For each company file that you back up, you can choose when, where, and how 
many backups QuickBooks creates. These standard settings are great timesavers 
and make for consistent backups. For example, you can tell QuickBooks to ask you 

Chapter 19: Managing QuickBooks Files
493
BACKING UP 
FILES
about backing up your data after you’ve closed the company file a specific number 
of times, or have it automatically append the date and time that you run the backup 
to the name of the backup file. You simply choose these settings once for each 
company file, and QuickBooks uses them for every backup of that file—until you 
change the settings, of course.
Here’s how to choose your backup settings:
1.	 Choose File→Backup Company→Create Local Backup.
The Create Backup dialog box opens with the “Local backup” option selected.
2.	 Click Options.
The Backup Options dialog box (Figure 19-1) lays out your choices for backing 
up the current company file.
FIGURE 19-1
The top section of this dialog box includes 
settings that apply only to local backups, 
like the location and the number of copies 
you want to save. 
The settings in the “Online and Local 
Backup” section, on the other hand, apply 
whether you create a backup on your 
computer or use one of Intuit’s online 
backup services (page 497). For example, 
you can specify how thoroughly you want 
the program to verify that your data isn’t 
corrupted.
3.	 To the right of the “Tell us where to save your backup copies (required)” 
box, click Browse. In the “Browse for Folder” dialog box, choose where 
you want to save the backup file, and then click OK to return to the Backup 
Options dialog box.
To protect your data from both human error and hardware failure, back up your 
file to a different hard drive than the one where your company file is stored, or 
to removable media like a CD, DVD, or USB thumb drive. That way, your backup 
file will be safe if the hard drive that holds your company file crashes. For that 
reason, if you choose a backup location that’s on the drive where you store 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
494
BACKING UP 
FILES
your company file, when you click OK in the Backup Options dialog box (step 
8 below), QuickBooks displays a dialog box with two buttons: Change Location 
and “Use this location.” To play it safe and save the backup in a different spot, 
click Change Location, which returns you to the Backup Options dialog box 
so you can click Browse again. Or, as long as you run company-wide backups 
that store your data on another disk or removable media and you’re OK with 
backing up your company file to a hard drive for protection during the day, 
click “Use this location.”
 NOTE 	 The “Browse for Folder” dialog box doesn’t let you create a new folder. So if you want to save your 
backups in a folder that doesn’t exist yet, click Cancel and create the new folder in Windows Explorer. Then, in 
the Backup Options dialog box, click Browse.
4.	 So that you never overwrite a backup file, make sure the “Add the date and 
time of the backup to the file name (recommended)” checkbox is turned on.
With this setting turned on, when QuickBooks creates the backup file, it tacks a 
timestamp onto the end of the filename prefix so that the name looks something 
like Double Trouble, Inc (Backup Mar 19,2015 08 46 PM).qbb. That way, unless 
you make multiple backups within a minute of each other, you can be sure the 
filenames are unique.
5.	 To cap the number of backup copies you save, keep the “Limit the number of 
backup copies in this folder to” checkbox turned on and choose a number.
With this setting on, QuickBooks takes care of deleting older backup files. 
The program automatically sets the limit to three, which is fine if you use a 
full-fledged backup program to back up all your data including your company 
files. If you back up your files to an insatiable hard disk, you can change this 
setting to save up to 99 backups before QuickBooks starts deleting older ones.
 NOTE 	 When you create a backup that hits the limit you set for backup copies in the folder, QuickBooks 
displays the “Delete Extra Backups?” dialog box, which asks you if you want to keep or delete the oldest backup 
file. Click “Yes, Delete” to delete the oldest file, or “No, Don’t Delete” if you decide to keep the file after all.
6.	 To have QuickBooks nudge you to back up your file every so often, in the 
“Online and local backup” section, make sure the “Remind me to back up 
when I close my company file every _ times” checkbox is on.
That way, when you’ve closed the company file that number of times (it’s set to 
four unless you change it), QuickBooks displays the Automatic Backup message 
box. To create a backup of your company file, in the message box, click Yes to 
display the Create Backup dialog box so you can run a backup. If you decide to 
bypass this backup opportunity, click No in the message box instead.

Chapter 19: Managing QuickBooks Files
495
BACKING UP 
FILES
7.	 Select a verification option.
If your company file is in single-user mode, QuickBooks automatically selects 
“Complete verification (recommended).” For a file in multi-user mode, the pro­
gram automatically selects “Quicker verification,” because complete verification 
isn’t available for multi-user files. Quicker verification, as its name suggests, is 
speedier than complete verification but risks letting some corrupted data slip 
through. If you want to make sure that the data you save isn’t corrupt, first 
switch your company file to single-user mode and then, in the Backup Options 
dialog box, select the “Complete verification (recommended)” option. At the 
other extreme, for high speed—and higher risk—select “No verification.”
8.	 When all the settings look good, click OK to close the Backup Options 
dialog box.
If you see a dialog box that includes a Change Location button, see step 3 for 
help deciding which option to choose.
9.	 Back in the Create Backup dialog box, click Finish to run a backup with the 
settings you chose.
Click Cancel to close the dialog box without running a backup.
Backing Up Manually
If you just spent several hours recording tricky transactions in QuickBooks, you 
definitely want to save that work. To run a backup right away, here’s what you do:
1.	 To back up your file to removable media like a CD, DVD, or USB thumb drive, 
put the disc in the drive (or the thumb drive into a USB port).
You don’t have to put the media in until just before you click Save, but you may 
as well do it now so you don’t forget.
2.	 Choose File→Backup Company→Create Local Backup.
The Create Backup dialog box opens.
3.	 To save the file to your computer or removable media, choose “Local 
backup” (if it isn’t already selected), and then click Next.
The Create Backup dialog box includes options for backing up your file locally—
on your computer or removable media—or online. To create an online backup, 
select (you guessed it) the “Online backup” option. QuickBooks’ online backup 
service isn’t free, but it has its advantages, as the box on page 497 explains.
4.	 For a local backup, on the “When do you want to save your backup copy?” 
screen, choose “Save it now” (if it isn’t already selected), and then click 
Next.
The Save Backup Copy dialog box opens to the folder you specified in Quick­
Books’ backup options (page 492), as Figure 19-2 shows. If you want to save 
the file somewhere else, browse to the folder.

FIGURE 19-2
QuickBooks automatically 
fills in the “File name” box 
with the same filename 
prefix as your company 
file and adds a timestamp 
to show when you made 
the backup—unless you 
told it not to (see step 
4 on page 494). For 
example, if you’re backing 
up your Double Trouble.
qbw file, the backup file’s 
prefix is something like 
“Double Trouble (Backup 
Mar 03,2015 11 38 AM).” 
The “Save as type” box is 
automatically set to “QBW 
Backup (*.qbb),” which is 
what you want.
5.	 Click Save.
The Working message box shows QuickBooks’ progress as it verifies your data 
and creates the backup. When it’s done, another message box tells you the 
backup was successful. Click OK to close the box.
Automated Backups
QuickBooks can back up your data without your help in two different ways:
• Automatic backup. This kind of backup runs after you close a company file a 
specific number of times, which is great for protecting the work you do in a few 
back-to-back QuickBooks sessions. You simply close the company file at the 
end of a session and, if this session hits the magic number, QuickBooks asks if 
you want to create a backup.
• Scheduled backups. You can also schedule backups to run at a specific date 
and time (typically when you aren’t around). A scheduled backup for a single 
company file is ideal when your QuickBooks data is the only data on your 
computer or you want to back up your books more often than your other data. 
Otherwise, you’re better off using your operating system’s backup feature (or 
an online backup service—see the box on page 497) to schedule a backup that 
captures all your data.
This section explains the differences between these options and how you set up 
each one.

POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Backing Up Online
Online backup services cost money, but as long as your Internet 
connection is relatively fast, they can be a worthwhile invest-
ment. You can use one to back up all your data—databases, 
documents, and email—so your backups reside in a data center 
managed by IT experts who live, eat, and breathe effective 
backup procedures.
Intuit Data Protect (http://appcenter.intuit.com/intuitdata 
protect) can back up your entire computer (not just your Quick-
Books company files), keeps file versions for up to 45 days, and 
automatically runs backups in the background every day so 
they don’t interrupt your work—even if files are open. Intuit 
recommends that you run Intuit Data Protect on only one PC. 
You can check out the service with a 30-day free trial.
Intuit’s backup services aren’t the only game in town. If the 
benefits of backing up online sound good, look at other services 
before you make your decision. Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) is 
a backup and synchronization service that’s perfect for financial 
professionals on the go. When you store files in a special folder 
on your computer, Dropbox copies them to your online account. 
If you hit the road with your laptop, Dropbox synchronizes the 
files onto your laptop when you go online. You initially get 2 GB 
of storage for free (and up to 18 GB as you refer other people 
to the service); 1 TB of storage costs $9.99 a month. SugarSync 
(www.sugarsync.com) is a similar backup and synchronization 
service, which offers 5 GB of storage free, 60 GB for $7.49 per 
month, and up to 250 GB for $24.99 per month.
Another option with a different approach is CrashPlan, which 
lets you back up files to the destination of your choice: another 
hard disk on your computer, from your laptop to your desktop 
computer, to a computer in another location, even from a Mac 
to a PC. CrashPlan compresses your files so backups take no 
time at all. You can download CrashPlan software at no charge, 
or purchase its online backup service. See www.crashplan.com 
for pricing details.
SETTING UP AUTOMATIC BACKUPS
Automatic backups require a bit of setup, but once you tell QuickBooks where you 
want to store the backup files and the number of sessions between backups, they 
spawn themselves quietly in the background. Here’s what you do:
1.	 Choose File→Backup Company→Create Local Backup. In the Create Backup 
dialog box, select the “Local backup” option, and then click Next.
The “When do you want to save your backup copy?” screen appears.
2.	 Select the “Only schedule future backups” option, and then click Next.
QuickBooks displays the settings you can use to define both automatic and 
scheduled backups (Figure 19-3).
3.	 Turn on the “Save backup copy automatically when I close my company file 
every _ times” checkbox. In the text box, type the number of sessions you 
want between automatic backups.
For example, if you type 5, QuickBooks creates an automatic backup when you 
close the company file the fifth time since the last backup.

and other details of your

Page 492 explains the set-
tings you can choose.
4.	 Click Finish.
QuickBooks starts counting. After you’ve completed the number of company-
file sessions you specified, the QuickBooks Automatic Backup message box 
appears, telling you that it’s creating the backup.
 NOTE 	 The “Remind me to back up when I close my company file every _ times” setting in the Backup Op­
tions dialog box (page 494) sounds a lot like the “Save backup copy automatically when I close my company file 
every _ times” setting for scheduled backups, but they do different things. The former tells QuickBooks to ask 
you if you want to back up your file after you’ve closed it that many times, whereas the latter tells QuickBooks 
to create a backup file automatically—without asking—after you close the company file that many times.
Here’s the file-naming convention that QuickBooks uses for automatic backup files:
ABU_0_[company name] [date stamp] [time stamp].qbb
For example, the first automatic backup file might be ABU_0_Double Trouble, Inc Mar 
13,2015 05 17 PM (ABU stands for “automatic backup”). When QuickBooks creates 
the next automatic backup, it renames the file that begins with ABU_0 to start with 
ABU_1 (ABU_1_Double Trouble, Inc Mar 13,2015 05 17 PM, for example), renames the 
ABU_1 file to start with ABU_2, and so on. With this system, you always know that 
the automatic backup file that starts with ABU_0 is the most recent.

SCHEDULING BACKUPS FOR A SINGLE COMPANY FILE
Although most companies back up all their computers on a regular schedule, you 
can set up a scheduled backup for your QuickBooks company file for an extra layer 
of safety. If you back up all your data every other day, for example, you may want 
to back up your company file every night, and a QuickBooks scheduled backup is 
one way to do that. Here’s how to schedule backups:
1.	 Choose File→Backup Company→Create Local Backup. In the Create Backup 
dialog box, select the “Local backup” option, and then click Next.
The “When do you want to save your backup copy?” screen appears.
2.	 Select the “Only schedule future backups” option, and then click Next.
To make a backup right away as well as set up the schedule, select the “Save it 
now and schedule future backups” option instead. Either way, the screen that 
appears includes a table showing scheduled backups you’ve already set up 
(if any), plus each backup’s description, location, status, and next occurrence.
3.	 To set up a schedule, below the table, click New.
QuickBooks opens the Schedule Backup dialog box (Figure 19-4), which includes 
all the options you need to set up a regularly scheduled backup.
4.	 In the Description box, type a meaningful name for the backup, like Daily 
or Monthly Offsite.
When you finish defining the schedule, this description will appear in the Cre­
ate Backup dialog box’s table. Consider including the backup’s frequency and 
location (such as the network drive or offsite location) in the name.
5.	 Click Browse to specify the backup location.
QuickBooks opens the “Browse for Folder” dialog box. To choose a folder, hard 
drive, or other location on your computer, expand the Computer, My Computer, 
or This PC entry (the name depends on which version of Windows you have), and 
then choose the location you want. To store the backup on another computer 
on your network, expand the Network or My Network Places entry instead, and 
then choose a location. Click OK when you’re done.
 WARNING 	 If you’ve set up scheduled backups, don’t turn off your computer when you go home, or the 
backups won’t work. And if you back up to a hard drive on another computer, leave that computer running, too.

BACKING UP 
FILES
FIGURE 19-4
You won’t need more than 
a few scheduled backups. 
For instance, you can 
create one to save your 
data every weeknight from 
Monday through Friday, a 
second to save a weekly 
backup every Saturday 
night, and a third to run 
once a month on Saturday 
to create a backup DVD 
that you can store offsite.
6.	 If you back up your company file to a hard drive and don’t want to overwrite 
the previous backup each time the scheduled backup runs, turn on the 
“Number of backup copies to keep” checkbox and, in the box to the right 
of the label, type the number of previous backups you want QuickBooks 
to preserve.
When you turn on this checkbox, QuickBooks uses the filename SBU_0_[com­
pany name] [date stamp] [time stamp].qbb (SBU stands for “scheduled 
backup”). For example, your scheduled backup file might be SBU_0_Double 
Trouble, Inc Sep 24,2015 01 00 AM.qbb. Each time QuickBooks creates a new 
scheduled backup file, it renames the previous backups to the next number in 
the list, and then replaces the SBU_0 file with the new backup. For example, if 
you keep four backups, the SBU_2 backup becomes the SBU_3 file; the SBU_1 
file becomes the SBU_2 file; the SBU_0 backup file becomes the SBU_1 file; 
and the new backup becomes the new SBU_0 file. The most recent backup 
always starts with “SBU_0.”

BACKUPS
7.	 In the “Start time” boxes, choose when you want the backup to run.
These boxes work on a 12-hour clock, so specify the hour, the minute, and AM 
or PM.
 TIP 	 It’s easy to confuse midnight and noon on a 12-hour clock (midnight is 12:00 a.m.; noon is 12:00 p.m.). 
Avoid this gotcha by running your scheduled backups at 11:00 p.m., 1:00 a.m., or later.
8.	 To set the backup’s frequency, in the “Run this task every _ weeks on” box, 
select the number of weeks you want between backups, and then turn on 
the checkboxes for each day of the week on which you want the backup to 
happen.
For example, for daily backups, in the “Run this task every _ weeks on” box, 
choose 1, and then turn on the checkbox for each weekday.
9.	 Click Store Password, and then type your Windows user name and password.
QuickBooks needs this info so it can log into the computer to run the backup.
10.	 When you’re done, click OK.
QuickBooks adds this backup to your list of scheduled backups.
Restoring Backups
Having backup files can reduce your adrenaline level in a number of situations:
• You merge two customers by mistake or commit some other major faux pas 
that you want to undo.
• Your company file won’t open, which can happen if it’s been damaged by a 
power outage or a power surge.
• You recently assigned a password to your administrator user (page 718) and 
can’t remember what it is.
• Your hard disk crashes and takes all your data with it.
 WARNING 	 These days, hard disk crashes can be deceptively quiet. So if you hear any odd sounds emanat­
ing from your computer—little chirps or squeaks, for instance—stop what you’re doing immediately and take it 
to a computer repair shop to see if someone can fix it or recover your data. If you shut down your computer and 
it won’t reboot because of a disk crash, a data-recovery company may be able to salvage some of your data, 
but the price is usually in the thousands of dollars. And if smoke wafts from your computer, don’t bother with 
shutting down—just pull the plug and get that puppy to a repair shop.
Here’s how to restore a QuickBooks backup when you need to recover from a mis­
take or damaged data:

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

RESTORING 
BACKUPS
1.	 If you backed up your data to removable media, put the disc containing the 
backup in the appropriate drive.
If you backed up your data to another hard drive on your computer or on a 
network, make sure you have access to that drive.
2.	 Choose File→Backup Company→Restore Previous Local Backup and then, 
on the submenu that appears, choose the backup file you want to restore.
If the backup you want isn’t listed in the submenu, choose File→“Open or Re­
store Company” instead. In the “Open or Restore Company” dialog box, shown 
in Figure 19-5, select the “Restore a backup copy” option, and then click Next. 
Select “Local backup,” and then click Next. Finally, in the Open Backup Copy 
dialog box, navigate to your backup file and double-click its name.
FIGURE 19-5
Similar to when you create backups, you 
have to tell QuickBooks that you want to 
restore a backup file and where that file 
is. From this dialog box, you can open a 
regular company file, restore a backup, re-
store a portable file (page 505), or convert 
an accountant’s copy (you’ll see this last 
option only if an accountant’s copy of your 
company file [page 462] exists).
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks 2010 and later versions can restore backup files to a format you can use in QuickBooks 
2009 or earlier—if, for example, a client is still using QuickBooks 2009 and asks you for a copy of her company 
file. The box on page 504 tells you why and how to restore a backup for an earlier QuickBooks version.
3.	 In the “Open or Restore Company” dialog box, the “Where do you want to 
restore the file?” screen makes it clear that you need to choose the restore 
location carefully. Click Next and, in the “Save Company File as” dialog box, 
choose the folder where you want to restore the file.
If you restore the backup to your regular company-file folder, you run the risk 
of overwriting your existing company file. If that’s what you want because your 
regular file won’t open, then fine. Otherwise, to be safe, restore the backup to 
your desktop. Then, once you know that the restored company file is the one you 
want, you can move it to the folder where you store your regular company files.

Chapter 19: Managing QuickBooks Files

COMPANY 
FILES TO

4.	 In the “File name” box, type a new name for the file you’re about to restore.
QuickBooks fills in the “File name” box with the company file’s name (minus 
the timestamp). The safest approach is to modify this name to include a unique 
identifier, so you don’t overwrite your existing company file.
 TIP 	 If you give a restored file a different name as a precaution—“Double Trouble Restored,” for example—you 
can trick QuickBooks into renaming the file after you’re sure it’s the one you want. To do that, create a manual 
backup of the file (page 495), and then immediately restore it with the company filename you want (“Double 
Trouble,” in this example).
5.	 Click Save.
If you’re restoring a backup of a company file that already exists and didn’t use a 
unique filename in step 4, QuickBooks warns you that you’re about to overwrite 
an existing file. If the original file is corrupt or won’t open for some reason, click 
Yes because that’s exactly what you want to do. In the Delete Entire File dialog 
box that appears, you also have to type Yes to confirm that you want to delete 
the file. (It’s better to take these precautions than to overwrite the wrong file 
and have to dig out yet another backup.)
If the restored file has a password, you have to log in, just as you do in a regular 
company file. When you see a message that says your data has been restored suc­
cessfully, click OK to open the company file and reenter any transactions that aren’t 
included in the backup.
 NOTE 	 If restoring a backup copy from removable media (CD, DVD, or USB thumb drive) doesn’t work, try 
copying the contents of the backup media to your hard drive, and then restoring the backup file from there. If the 
restore still doesn’t work, your backup file is probably damaged, so try restoring the next-most-recent backup.
If none of your backups work, Intuit offers a data-recovery service that can extract data from your backup files. 
The service isn’t free, but it might be cheaper than rebuilding your entire company file. To arrange for this service, 
choose Help→Support, and then, at the top of the page, click Contact Us. On the page that opens, in the Product 
drop-down list, choose the product you want help with, and then call the phone number listed on the site. If the 
support person can’t resolve the problem with your file, he’ll transfer you to the Intuit Data Recovery Services team.
Sending Company Files to Others
QuickBooks company files can grow quite large as you add year after year of finan­
cial transactions. Fortunately, QuickBooks can create portable company files, a slim 
format that flies through the email ether and slips effortlessly onto removable media 
like USB thumb drives and CDs. For example, you can email a portable company file 
to your accountant before you head out on vacation.

DON’T PANIC
Restoring to an Earlier QuickBooks Version
QuickBooks 2010 and more recent versions use a new and 
improved method to compress backup files that doesn’t work 
with earlier versions of the program. But when it converts 
a company file to work with a new version of the program, 
QuickBooks backs up your file so you can restore it in case you 
run into trouble. So if you switch back to an earlier version of the 
program, you can’t restore a QuickBooks 2010 or later backup 
file directly in that earlier version. Here’s what to do instead:
1.	 In QuickBooks 2010 or later, choose File→Utilities→Restore 
Backup For Earlier QuickBooks Version.
2.	 In the “Select the backup file you want to restore” section 
of the Restore Your Company File dialog box, click the 
ellipsis button (…). The Open Backup Copy dialog box 
appears, displaying the contents of the folder where you 
last saved backup files.
3.	 Select the QuickBooks backup file you want to restore, 
and then click Open. 
4.	 In the “Where do you want to save the restored file?” 
section of the Restore Your Company File dialog box, click 
the ellipsis button (…). The “Save Company File as” dialog 
box appears showing the contents of the backup folder.
5.	 Navigate to the folder where you want to save the restored 
file; for example, you might choose the folder you use to 
store your company files.
6.	 In the “File name” box, type a unique name for the 
restored file, such as CompanyFileRestored_03052015, 
and then click Save.
7.	 Back in the Restore Your Company File dialog box, click OK. 
A message box appears telling you that the file has been 
restored and where it is. Click OK to close the message box.
Now you can open the restored file as a regular company file 
in the earlier version of QuickBooks.
Portable files don’t contain all the info that backup files do, such as letters you create 
in QuickBooks, logos, images, and templates. So if you’re handing off your company 
file for good (for example, when you sell your company to someone else), give the 
new owner the regular company file or a QuickBooks backup of it. That way, when 
he copies the company file onto his computer (or restores the backup file), all your 
data will be there. 
Because portable files don’t contain all your data, they’re much smaller than regular 
company files. For example, a company file that’s more than 10 MB in size turns into 
a portable company file of less than 1 MB. Portable company files have a .qbm file 
extension, but when you open them, QuickBooks converts them to regular company 
files with a .qbw file extension.
 TIP 	 If you intend to work on the company file at the same time as your accountant and want to merge her 
changes into your copy, create an accountant’s copy (page 462) instead of a portable copy.
And before you transmit a company file electronically—no matter what format it’s in—be sure you’ve added a 
password to it (page 723) so nobody can intercept it and access your financial data. That way, the person you 
send the file to needs a user name and password to open it (page 25).

Creating a Portable Company File
Creating a portable company file is just a wee bit more complicated than saving 
a file. (You need to be in single-user mode to create a portable company file, so if 
you’re in multi-user mode, switch to single-user mode as explained on page 489 
before getting started.) Here are the steps:
1.	 Choose File→Create Copy.
The “Save Copy or Backup” dialog box that appears lets you create a backup 
file, a portable company file, or an accountant’s copy.
2.	 Select the “Portable company file” option, and then click Next.
QuickBooks opens the Save Portable Company File dialog box (Figure 19-6). 
It automatically fills in the “File name” box with the name of your company 
file, followed by “(Portable),” and sets the “Save as type” box to “QuickBooks 
Portable Company Files (*.QBM).”
FIGURE 19-6
The Save Portable 
Company File dialog box 
opens to your computer’s 
desktop the first time 
around. 
If you want to save the 
file to a folder, choose 
the folder. From then on, 
QuickBooks opens this 
dialog box to the last 
folder you selected.
3.	 Choose the folder where you want to restore the file.
The first time you open the Save Portable Company File dialog box, it selects 
your computer’s desktop. After that, it opens to the last location where you 
saved a backup file or copy.
4.	 If you want to use a different filename, edit the text in the “File name” box, 
and then click Save.
The “Close and reopen” message box tells you that you need to close and reopen 
your company file to create a portable file.

5.	 Click OK to create the file.
A message box appears when QuickBooks finishes creating the portable com­
pany file. Click OK to reopen your company file. (You can tell that the company 
file is open when you see its name in the main QuickBooks window’s title bar. 
However, you might have to reopen windows such as the Home Page or the 
Chart of Accounts window.)
Feel free to view the portable company file in Windows Explorer and admire its 
sleek size.
 TIP 	 If you use a cloud-storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive to share files with your accountant, 
sending a portable file to him is a breeze: First, choose File→Send Company File→Portable Company File. In the 
Send Portable Company File dialog box, click Browse, and then, in the Select Shared Folder dialog box, choose the 
shared folder where you want to create the portable file. Finally, back in the Send Portable Company File dialog 
box, click Send. In the “Close and reopen” dialog box, click OK. QuickBooks leaps into action, creating a portable 
file of your company file in the folder you selected.
Opening a Portable Company File
Opening a portable company file is almost identical to restoring a backup file, 
except for a few different settings labels. When you open a portable company file, 
QuickBooks essentially converts it into a full-size, bona fide company file. Here’s 
what you do:
1.	 Choose File→“Open or Restore Company.”
Or, if the No Company Open window is visible, you can click “Open or restore 
an existing company.” Either method opens the “Open or Restore Company” 
dialog box.
2.	 Select the “Restore a portable file” option, and then click Next.
QuickBooks opens the Open Portable Company File dialog box to the last 
folder you selected for portable company files and sets the “Files of type” box 
to “QuickBooks Portable Company Files (*.QBM)” so the dialog box’s list shows 
only portable company files.
3.	 Double-click the portable file you want to restore.
Alternatively, click its filename and then click Open.
4.	 Back in the “Open or Restore Company” dialog box, the “Where do you 
want to restore the file?” screen makes it clear that you should choose the 
location carefully. Click Next.
If you restore the portable file to your regular company-file folder, you’ll over­
write your existing company file. If that’s what you want, fine. Otherwise, be 
sure to choose another folder or to change the filename in the next step.

Chapter 19: Managing QuickBooks Files

VERIFYING 
YOUR

5.	 In the “Save Company File as” dialog box, choose the folder to which you 
want to restore the file. In the “File name” box, type a new name.
The dialog box opens to the folder you last chose for portable files. If you 
want to replace your company file, choose the folder that holds your everyday 
company file.
The safest approach is to modify the filename to include a unique identifier, 
such as “_restoredportable,” so you can easily identify the file you restored. 
You can then rename the file later (page 503 describes a quick way to do so).
6.	 Click Save.
If you’re restoring a portable file for a company file that already exists, Quick­
Books warns you that you’re about to overwrite an existing file. If that’s what 
you want, click Yes, and then type Yes to confirm that you want to delete the 
existing file. The Working message box shows the program’s progress (restoring 
a portable file can take several minutes). When the file is ready, the QuickBooks 
Login dialog box appears or, if the company file doesn’t have a password as­
signed to it, the file opens.
Verifying Your QuickBooks Data
QuickBooks files hiccup now and then. Perhaps you worked through a spectacular 
thunderstorm and a power spike zapped a bit of your company file, for example. 
Fortunately, QuickBooks has a feature that can scan your company files and tell you 
whether they’ve suffered any damage: the Verify Data utility.
It’s a good idea to run this utility every so often, just to make sure your company file 
is OK. How often you should run it depends on how hard you work your company 
file, but monthly verifications are in order for most companies. And this utility is 
indispensable if you notice any of the following symptoms:
• The file won’t open. Sometimes, memorized transactions become corrupt, 
which prevents you from opening your company file.
• Error messages. If you see a message box telling you that an error has occurred, 
QuickBooks may have a glitch or your company file might be damaged. Make 
sure you’ve installed the latest maintenance release by choosing Help→Update 
QuickBooks and then clicking Update Now. If you have the latest maintenance 
release installed and you see the error message box again, then verify your data 
to correct any data corruption in your company file.
• Discrepancies on reports. Your balance sheet doesn’t show all your accounts, 
or transactions show negative values instead of positive ones.
 TIP 	 If the totals in your reports don’t seem right, first check that the reports’ dates are correct and that you’re 
using the right cash or accrual accounting setting (see page 661).

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
508
VERIFYING 
YOUR 
QUICKBOOKS 
DATA
• Missing transactions and names. Transactions or names that you’re sure you 
entered don’t appear in reports or lists.
• You can’t save transactions. QuickBooks doesn’t save a transaction or shuts 
down when you try to save a transaction.
• QuickBooks misbehaves. It’s a good idea to verify your company file if 
QuickBooks shuts down on its own, your computer crashes, a “Company file 
in use, please wait” message appears, or you see other strange behavior from 
QuickBooks or your computer.
Running the Verify Data Utility
Whether you’re just giving your company file a checkup or you see signs of problems, 
the Verify Data utility is easy to use:
1.	 Close QuickBooks and then restart it.
This makes QuickBooks create a new QBWIN.log file, which will contain only 
the results of the data verification you’ll run in step 3. (When you verify data, 
QuickBooks automatically renames the previous QBWIN.log file to QBWIN.log.
old1 so that the QBWIN.log file contains information for only the most recent 
verification. QuickBooks also renames other old files, changing QBWIN.log.old1 
to QBWIN.log.old2, and so on.)
 NOTE 	 You can verify data in multi-user mode, although no other users will be able to use QuickBooks while 
it’s verifying the company file. In addition, the program can perform a more thorough verification when the file 
is in single-user mode. So you’re best off switching to single-user mode (page 489) before running this utility.
2.	 To start the utility, choose File→Utilities→Verify Data. (If any windows are 
open, click OK to give QuickBooks permission to close them.)
You can close all QuickBooks windows before you run the utility by choosing 
Window→Close All.
3.	 If you see the message “A data problem prevents QuickBooks from continu­
ing” (Figure 19-7), then your company file has some problems. Continue to 
the next section to learn how to rebuild your data.
If, on the other hand, QuickBooks displays a message saying that it detected 
no problems with your data, your file isn’t necessarily healthy: It could contain 
a problem that the Verify Data utility doesn’t recognize. If you still have prob­
lems with your company file after verifying it, try rebuilding it as described in 
the next section.

If you see this message, your company file has suffered some kind of

The Rebuild Data utility (described below) can help fix the problem(s) 
and get you back to work.
Reviewing Problems
The Verify Data utility writes down any errors it finds in a file named QBWIN.log. 
Before you run the Rebuild Data utility described in the next section (which can 
help fix the problems QuickBooks found), it’s a good idea to take a look at this log 
file and review your company file’s problems. However, you’ll need a map to find 
the log file. Here’s how:
1.	 Press F2 to open the Product Information dialog box. Then press Ctrl+2 to 
open the Tech Help dialog box.
The Tech Help dialog box includes several tabs for inspecting various aspects 
of your computer and QuickBooks.
2.	 Click the Open File tab. In the “Select a file to open” list, click QBWIN.LOG, 
and then click the Open File button.
The file opens in Notepad, and you can use Notepad’s features to move around 
the file. (If the file doesn’t open, launch Notepad, choose File→Open, and then 
double-click the QBWIN.log filename.)
Running the Rebuild Data Utility
If your company file is damaged, QuickBooks’ Rebuild Data utility tries to fix it. Intuit 
recommends that you run the Rebuild Data utility only if an Intuit technical support 
person tells you to. Always make a backup of your company file before trying to 
rebuild it, and take extra care to prevent overwriting your previous backups—those 
files might be your only salvation if the rebuild doesn’t work.
To run the Rebuild Data utility, choose File→Utilities→Rebuild Data. A message 
box appears telling you that QuickBooks is going to back up your company file and 
warning you not to overwrite any existing backups. Click OK and make sure to type 
a unique backup name in the “File name” box before you click Save. 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
510
CONDENSING 
DATA
When the utility is done working, close your company file and reopen it; this refreshes 
the lists in the company file so you can see if the problems are gone. Then run the 
Verify Data utility once more to see if any damage remains. If this second Verify Data 
run still shows errors, then restore a recent backup of your company file (page 501).
Condensing Data
As you add transactions and build lists in QuickBooks, your company file gets larger. 
Although larger company files aren’t too big of a hassle, you might be alarmed when 
your company file reaches hundreds of megabytes. Once you reach that point, 
backups will take longer and use up more storage space. That’s why QuickBooks 
includes the Condense Data utility, which creates an archive file and deletes obsolete 
list items and transactions prior to the date you choose.
 WARNING 	 The Condense Data utility removes the audit trail information for transactions that it deletes. So 
if you’re watching transaction activity, print an Audit Trail report and back up your company file before condensing.
When QuickBooks condenses data, it replaces the detailed transactions prior to 
the date you specify with journal entries that summarize the deleted transactions 
by month. As a result, some of your financial details are no longer available for run­
ning reports, filing taxes, and other accounting activities. Still, there are a couple of 
compelling reasons to condense data:
• You no longer refer to old transactions. If you’re a QuickBooks veteran, you 
probably don’t need the finer details from eight or more years ago. And if you 
ever do need details from the past, you can open an archive file (explained in 
a sec) to run reports.
• You have obsolete list items. Cleaning up a company file can remove list 
items you don’t use, like customers you no longer sell to. This option comes in 
handy if you’re nearing the program’s limit on the number of names you can 
store (page xvii).
 NOTE 	 If the Condense Data utility isn’t the housekeeper you hoped for, you have a couple of options. One 
is to start a fresh company file. That way, you can export all the lists from your existing company file (page 685) 
and import them (page 691) into the new one so you start with lists but no transactions. (Set your accounts’ 
opening balances [page 62] to the values for the start date of the new file.) Or you can hand your company file 
over to a company that provides file-cleanup and repair services, such as “QB or not QB” (www.qbornotqb.com).
The Condense Data utility creates an archive file, which is a regular company file 
that contains all your transactions, but it’s read-only, meaning you can’t add data 
to it or edit it, so you can’t inadvertently enter new transactions. If QuickBooks runs 
into trouble condensing your file, it automatically pulls transaction details from the 
archive file. An archive copy isn’t a backup file, which means you can’t restore it to 

Chapter 19: Managing QuickBooks Files
511
CONDENSING 
DATA
replace a corrupt company file. So even if you create an archive copy, you still need 
to back up your data.
If you decide to condense your company file, here’s what you can expect to find 
afterward, depending on the settings you choose:
• Journal entries that summarize deleted transactions. QuickBooks replaces 
all the deleted transactions that happened during each month with one journal 
entry. For example, instead of 20 separate invoices for the month of June, you’ll 
see one journal entry with the total income for June for each income account.
 NOTE 	 If you see other transactions for the same month, it means that QuickBooks wasn’t able to delete 
those transactions for some reason. For instance, if you tell it not to, QuickBooks won’t delete unpaid invoices or 
other transactions with an open balance, nor will it delete any transactions in the queue to be printed or ones 
that you haven’t reconciled.
• Inventory adjustments that reflect the average cost of items. If you tell it to, 
QuickBooks removes inventory transactions that are complete, such as invoices 
that have been paid in full. Because inventory transactions use the average 
cost of inventory items, QuickBooks adds an inventory adjustment to set the 
average cost of the items as of the condense date. When the program finds an 
inventory transaction that it can’t condense (perhaps because the payment is 
outstanding), it keeps all the inventory transactions from that date forward.
• Reports might not include the details you want. You can still generate sum­
mary reports because QuickBooks can incorporate the info in the monthly journal 
entries the utility creates. Likewise, sales tax reports still include data about 
your sales tax liabilities. But detailed reports won’t include transaction details 
before the cutoff date you chose for condensing the file. And cash-accounting 
reports (page xxii) might not be accurate because they need the dates for 
detailed transactions. Talk with your accountant to see how your cash-basis 
reports might be affected.
• You still have payroll info for the current year. QuickBooks keeps payroll 
transactions for the current year regardless of the cutoff date you chose for 
condensing the file.
• QuickBooks deletes estimates for closed jobs. If a job has any status other than 
Closed, QuickBooks keeps the estimates for that job. Or you can tell QuickBooks 
to remove all estimates, sales orders, purchase orders, and pending invoices.
• QuickBooks retains unbilled expenses, items, time, and mileage. The pro­
gram keeps any unbilled charges, unless you tell it to delete those transactions.
Running the Condense Data Utility
If you’re ready to condense your company file, first consider when to do it. The 
cleaning process can take several hours for a large company file, and a slow com­
puter or a small amount of memory exacerbates the problem. You might want to

1.	 If you’ve created budgets in QuickBooks, export them (page 588) before 
you condense your data.
After you condense your data, you can import them back into your company 
file (page 570).
2.	 Choose File→Utilities→Condense Data.
The Condense Data dialog box opens.
3.	 Select the “Transactions before a specific date” option.
This option deletes old transactions and things like unused accounts and items.
The “All transactions” option removes transactions but keeps your preferences, 
lists, and service subscriptions—such as payroll—intact. You won’t use this op­
tion often, but it comes in handy if, for example, you want to offer your clients 
a template company file that contains typical list entries but no transactions.
4.	 In the “Remove transactions before” box, type or select the ending date 
for the period you want to condense, and then click Next.
If you use an Intuit payroll service (page 415), you can’t clean up data for the 
current year. QuickBooks also won’t let you clean up transactions that are newer 
than the closing date on your company file (page 472). Choosing a date at least 
two years in the past ensures that you can compare detailed transactions for 
the current year and the previous year. For example, if it’s April 1, 2015, consider 
using January 1, 2013, or earlier as your cutoff date.
 NOTE 	 If there aren’t any transactions to condense before the date you picked, you’ll see the message “There 
are no transactions to remove on or before the date you entered. Please verify the Condense process date.” Click 
OK, and then either pick a date closer to today’s date or click Cancel, because there aren’t any transactions for 
the utility to condense.
5.	 If you see the “How Should Transactions Be Summarized?” screen (you may 
not), select your preferred method.
Your options are to have QuickBooks create one summary journal entry for all 
the transactions it condenses, create a summary journal entry for each month 
prior to the date you selected, or not create a summary at all. QuickBooks 
automatically selects the first option, and you’re best off sticking with that so 
you have a record of your previous transactions without dozens of summary 
journal entries cluttering your company file.

CONDENSING 
DATA
6.	 If you see the “How Should Inventory Be Condensed?” screen, keep the 
“Summarize inventory transactions (recommended)” option selected and 
click Next.
This removes inventory transactions that QuickBooks can condense and replaces 
them with inventory adjustments (page 542).
7.	 On the “Do You Want To Remove The Following Transactions?” screen, turn 
off the appropriate checkboxes if you want to keep transactions that the 
cleanup process would otherwise condense, and then click Next.
Figure 19-8 shows your choices. All the checkboxes are initially turned on. Before 
you click Next, carefully review your company file to make sure that the set­
tings you choose here won’t delete transactions you want to keep. If you want 
QuickBooks to leave all these transactions alone, click Select None.
FIGURE 19-8
These checkboxes let you 
remove transactions that 
the Condense Data util-
ity would normally leave 
alone—like transactions 
marked “To be printed” 
that you don’t need to 
print. If you have very old, 
unreconciled transactions, 
invoices, or estimates 
marked “To be sent,” or 
transactions with unre-
imbursed costs, leave the 
appropriate checkboxes 
turned on to remove them 
during the condensing.
8.	 On the “Do You Want To Remove Unused List Entries?” screen, turn off the 
appropriate checkboxes if you want QuickBooks to keep specific list items, 
and then click Next.
Accounts, customers, jobs, vendors, other names, and invoice items might 
become orphans when you delete old transactions they’re linked to. You can 
neaten your file by removing these list items, which now have no links to the 
transactions that still remain. QuickBooks initially turns on all the checkboxes 
on this screen. But keep in mind that you might work with one of these vendors 
or customers in the future. In that case, turn off checkboxes to tell the program 
to keep unused list entries.

9.	 On the Begin Condense screen, click Begin Condense.
If you’re not sure of the options you chose, or if you have any doubts about 
condensing your file, click Back to return to a previous screen, or click Cancel 
to exit without condensing.
When you click Begin Condense, QuickBooks first creates an archive file (a Quick­
Books company file, not a backup file) in the same folder as your original company file. 
The archive file’s filename has the format [company name] mm-dd-yyyy Copy.qbw, 
where “mm-dd-yyyy” represents the month, day, and year that you created the file.
As QuickBooks proceeds with the condensing process, it scans your data three times. 
You might see message boxes wink on and off in rapid succession; then again, if your 
file is large, you might not see anything happen for a while. But if your hard disk 
is working, the condensing process is in progress. When it’s finished, QuickBooks 
displays a message telling you so and shows you where it stored the archive file.
 TIP 	 After you condense your company file, run a balance sheet report (page 451) and compare the account 
balances in the archive file with those in the uncondensed file. (You open an archive file just like you do a regular 
company file [page 23].)
Cleaning Up After Deleting Files
QuickBooks doesn’t include a feature for deleting company files, which is no biggie. 
If you want to get rid of a practice file you no longer use, you can easily delete it right 
in Windows. But you’ll still have to do some housekeeping to remove all references 
to that file from QuickBooks. For example, a deleted company file will still appear 
in QuickBooks’ list of previously opened files (page 24), but the program won’t be 
able to find the file if you choose it in the list.
Here’s how to delete a company file and eliminate stale entries in QuickBooks’ list 
of previously opened files:
1.	 In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder where your QuickBooks com­
pany files are stored, and find the file you want to delete.
What to look for when searching for your company file depends on how you’ve 
set up your folder view. If your folder shows full filenames, look for a file with a 
.qbw file extension, such as Double Trouble, Inc.qbw. If the folder includes a Name 
column and a Type column, the type you want is QuickBooks Company File.
Files with .qbx extensions represent accountant’s copies (page 462). Files with 
.qbb file extensions are backup copies of company files. Portable files come 
with .qbm file extensions. If you delete the company file, go ahead and delete 
the backups, accountant’s copies, and portable files as well if you no longer 
need them.

2.	 Right-click the file and, on the shortcut menu, choose Delete.
Windows displays the Delete File message box. Click Yes to move the file to the 
Recycle Bin. If you have second thoughts, click No to keep the file.
3.	 In QuickBooks, choose File→Open Previous Company→“Set number of 
previous companies.”
If this menu item is grayed out, it means you don’t have a company file open. 
In that case, in the File→Open Previous Company submenu, choose a file other 
than the one you just deleted. Alternatively, if the No Company Open window is 
visible, open the company file that you typically work with by double-clicking 
it. Either way, you should then be able to select the “Set number of previous 
companies” menu item.
4.	 In the “How many companies do you want to list (1 to 20)?” box, type 1, 
and then click OK.
Now, if you choose File→Open Previous Company, you’ll notice that only one 
company appears—the company file you opened last. The No Company Open 
window also shows only the company file you opened last.
5.	 To reset the number of previously opened companies, with a company file 
open, choose File→Open Previous Company→“Set number of previous 
companies” again.
In the “How many companies do you want to list (1 to 20)?” box, type the number 
of companies you’d like to see in the list, and then click OK.
As you open different company files, QuickBooks adds them to the list in the No 
Company Open window and the Open Previous Company submenu.

CHAPTER
20
A
s you record inventory purchases and sales in QuickBooks, the program keeps 
track of your inventory, just as the point-of-service system at the grocery 
store does when a cashier scans items. This chapter begins by explaining 
how to turn on QuickBooks’ inventory features and set up inventory items in your 
company file so the program can work this magic.
Unless you practice just-in-time inventory management, you need inventory in 
your warehouse to fill customer orders. If you follow the lead of many companies, 
you start by creating purchase orders for the inventory you buy so you can verify 
that you receive what you’re supposed to. The next step in the inventory process 
is receiving the inventory and paying for it. Finally, all that work pays off when you 
sell products out of inventory to your customers. This chapter shows you how to 
create purchase orders, receive inventory, and pay for it. Recording inventory sales 
is just like recording any other sales; QuickBooks handles the extra money transfers 
between accounts behind the scenes. You’ll learn what the program does to track how 
much inventory you have (and what it’s worth) as you record all these transactions.
Good inventory management means more than just updating the number of items 
that QuickBooks thinks you have on hand. To keep the right number of items in stock, 
you also need to know how many you’ve sold and how many are on order. And to 
make decisions like how much to charge or which vendor to use, you have to evaluate 
your purchases and how much you pay for your inventory. QuickBooks’ inventory 
reports and Inventory Center help you look at your inventory items and transac­
tions. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to make the most of both of these features.
 NOTE 	 The Inventory Center is available only in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise. If you have QuickBooks 
Pro, you can run inventory reports, but you don’t have access to the center.

FOLLOWING 
THE 
INVENTORY 
MONEY TRAIL
Another important aspect of inventory is keeping your QuickBooks records in sync 
with what’s sitting on the shelves in your warehouse. Inventory can go missing due 
to theft or damage, so you might not have as many products in stock as you think 
you do. QuickBooks can’t help with the dusty business of rifling through boxes and 
counting carafes, coffee mugs, and the occasional centipede. But after the counting 
is complete, the program can help you adjust its records to match the reality in your 
warehouse. And adjusting inventory is useful for more than just inventory counts. 
You can also use this process to write off inventory that you have in your warehouse 
but can’t sell because it’s dented, dirty, or too darned ugly.
Following the Inventory Money Trail
Inventory Part items are the most complicated type of item because, in account­
ing, the cost of inventory moves from place to place as you purchase, store, and 
finally sell your products. Before diving into the details of setting up and recording 
inventory transactions, it’s a good idea to see how inventory works its way through 
various accounts in your chart of accounts. Table 20-1 and the following steps show 
the path that inventory-related money takes:
1.	 You spend money to purchase products to sell in your store. Your checking or 
credit card account shows the money you pay going out the door.
2.	 Because the inventory you purchased has value, it represents an asset of your 
company. Hence, the value of the purchased inventory appears in an inventory 
asset account in your chart of accounts.
3.	 When you sell some products, QuickBooks posts the sale to an income account 
(such as Product Income), and the money your customer owes you shows up 
in Accounts Receivable.
4.	 The products leave inventory, so QuickBooks deducts their value from the 
inventory asset account. The value of the sold goods has to go somewhere, 
so QuickBooks posts it to a cost of goods sold account.

SETTING UP 
INVENTORY 
ITEMS
In the financial reports you create, your company’s gross profit represents your 
income minus the cost of goods sold (in this example, $1,000 income minus $500 
cost of goods sold for $500 gross profit). As soon as you turn on QuickBooks’ 
inventory-tracking preference as explained below, the program adds cost of goods 
sold and inventory asset accounts to your chart of accounts.
Setting Up Inventory Items
You set the stage for inventory tracking when you turn on QuickBooks’ inventory 
preference and create inventory items in your company file. Inventory item records 
(which appear in your Item List: Lists→Item List) include purchase costs, sales prices, 
and accounts, all of which direct the right amount of money into the right income, 
expense, asset, and cost of goods sold accounts as you buy and sell inventory. This 
section shows you how to turn on inventory and set up inventory items.
Turning on Inventory
If you want to track inventory in QuickBooks, your first task is turning on the pref­
erence for inventory and purchase orders (if you didn’t do that when you created 
your company file). Although the program turns on purchase-order features as part 
of tracking inventory, you can skip purchase orders if you don’t use them in your 
business.
To turn on inventory in QuickBooks, choose Edit→Preferences→Items & Inventory, 
and then click the Company Preferences tab. Turn on the “Inventory and purchase 
orders are active” checkbox, and then click OK. (You need administrator privileges 
to turn on inventory features because they apply to everyone who logs into your 
company file.) As soon as you do that, QuickBooks warns you that it needs to close 
all your open windows. Click OK, and the following changes occur:
• Icons for purchase orders and inventory appear on the Home Page.
• Inventory-related options like Create Purchase Orders and Receive Items ap­
pear in the Vendors menu.
• A non-posting account called Purchase Orders appears in your chart of accounts.
• An Other Current Asset account called Inventory Asset appears in your chart 
of accounts.
Creating Inventory Items
Creating inventory items is similar to creating other types of items: In the Item List 
window (Lists→Item List), press Ctrl+N, select Inventory Part in the Type drop-down 
menu, and then fill in the Item Name/Number box with the item’s name. (If you 
want to make the inventory item a subitem of another one, turn on the “Subitem 
of” checkbox, and then choose the parent item in the drop-down list.) The differ­
ence is that you have to fill in more fields than you do for other item types, as you 
can see in Figure 20-1.

INVENTORY 
ITEMS
FIGURE 20-1
When you create a new 
Inventory Part item, 
QuickBooks displays fields 
for purchasing and selling 
that item. The fields in the 
Purchase Information sec-
tion show up on purchase 
orders and bills. The Sales 
Information section sets 
the values you see on sales 
forms, such as invoices 
and sales receipts. The 
program simplifies record-
ing your initial inventory 
by letting you type in the 
quantity you already have 
on hand and its value.
 NOTE 	 The box on page 522 explains one way to set up inventory items that you assemble from other inven­
tory items, such as gift baskets. And the box on page 524 describes another method for tracking large batches 
of products you assemble.
Here are the fields for an Inventory Part item and how they help you track inventory 
from initial order to final sale:
• Manufacturer’s Part Number. If you want your purchase orders to include the 
manufacturer’s part number or unique identifier for the product, enter it here.
 NOTE 	 If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, you’ll also see a “Unit of Measure” section, which lets 
you specify the units the inventory part comes in (bottles, cases, tons, cubic feet, or whatever). When you define 
units for an inventory part, they appear on invoices, sales forms, and reports. To turn this feature on, in the New 
Item (or Edit Item) dialog box, click the Enable button, and then choose whether you want to assign one or several 
units of measure to each item. Once this feature is turned on, the New Item and Edit Item dialog boxes display 
the U/M box in the “Unit of Measure” section so you can choose the appropriate unit from the drop-down list.
• Description on Purchase Transactions. Whatever you type here appears on the 
purchase orders you issue and bills you pay to buy inventory items. Describe the 
product in terms that the vendor or manufacturer understands. (As explained 
in a moment, you can use a different, more customer-friendly description for 
the invoices that customers see.)

Chapter 20: Managing Inventory
521
SETTING UP 
INVENTORY 
ITEMS
• Cost. Enter what you pay for one unit of the product. QuickBooks assumes 
you sell products in the same units that you buy them. So, for example, if you 
purchase four cases of merlot but sell wine by the bottle, enter the price you 
pay per bottle in this field.
• COGS Account. Choose the account to which you want to post the cost when 
you sell the product. (COGS stands for “cost of goods sold,” which is an account 
for tracking the underlying costs of the things you sell in order to calculate your 
gross profit, which you can learn about on page 446.)
 NOTE 	 If you don’t already have a cost of goods sold account in your chart of accounts, QuickBooks creates 
one as soon as you type the name of your first Inventory Part item in the New Item window.
• Preferred Vendor. If you choose a vendor in this drop-down list, QuickBooks 
selects that vendor when you add this Inventory Part item to a purchase order 
or bill.
• Description on Sales Transactions. QuickBooks automatically copies what 
you typed in the “Description on Purchase Transactions” field into this box, 
so it appears on sales forms like invoices, credit memos, and sales receipts. If 
your customers wouldn’t understand that description, type a more customer-
friendly one here.
• Sales Price. Type in how much you charge for the product, and make sure that 
the Cost field uses the same units. For example, if you sell a bottle of merlot for 
$15, type 15 in this field and type the price you pay per bottle in the Cost field.
• Tax Code. If you turned on the sales tax preference (page 664) in your company 
file, then when you add an item to an invoice, QuickBooks checks this field to 
see whether the item is taxable. (QuickBooks comes with two tax codes: Non 
for nontaxable items and Tax for taxable items.) Most products are taxable, 
although groceries are a common exception.
• Income Account. This drop-down list includes all the accounts in your chart of 
accounts. Choose the income account you use for the money you receive when 
you sell one of these products.
• Asset Account. Choose the asset account for the value of the inventory you buy. 
Suppose you buy 100 bottles of merlot, which are each worth the $8 a bottle 
you paid; QuickBooks posts $800 into your inventory asset account. When you 
sell a bottle, the program deducts $8 from the inventory asset account and adds 
that $8 to your COGS account.
• Reorder Point (Min). Type the quantity on hand that would prompt you to order 
more. When your inventory hits that number, QuickBooks adds a reminder to 
reorder this product to the Reminders List (page 483). If you use QuickBooks 
Premier or Enterprise, you’ll also see a Max box, where you can enter the maxi­
mum quantity you want to have after reordering. For example, if you want 20 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
522
PURCHASING 
INVENTORY
on hand, type 20 in the Reorder Point Max box. That way, if you place an order 
and have nine of the item on hand, the program tells you to reorder 11.
 TIP 	 If you can receive products quickly, use a lower reorder point to reduce the money tied up in inventory 
and prevent write-offs due to obsolete inventory. If products take a while to arrive, set the reorder point higher. 
Start with your best guess and then edit this field as business conditions change.
• On Hand. If you already have some of the product in inventory, type the quantity 
in this field. From then on, as you record inventory you receive, you can trust 
QuickBooks to accurately post inventory values in your accounts.
• Total Value. If you filled in the On Hand field, then fill in this field with the total 
value of the quantity on hand. QuickBooks increases the value of your inventory 
asset account accordingly.
• As of. The program uses this date for the transaction it creates in your inven­
tory asset account.
 NOTE 	 You can enter values for the last three fields listed above only when you create a new item, not when 
you edit an existing one. From then on, QuickBooks calculates how many you have on hand based on the numbers 
you’ve received and sold.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Assembling Products
In the Premier and Enterprise editions of QuickBooks, you can 
create an Inventory Assembly item that gathers Inventory Part 
items into a new item that you sell as a whole. As shown in 
Figure 20-2, the New Item window for an assembled item is 
similar to the one for an inventory part. The main difference 
is that you select other Inventory Part items or Inventory As-
sembly items as the building blocks of your new item.
In the “Bill of Materials” section, you specify the components 
and the quantity of each, and QuickBooks then calculates the 
total cost of the bill of materials—that is, the list of all the 
materials that make up the assembled product. In the Sales 
Price field, type the price you charge for the entire ball of wax, 
regardless of the cost of the individual pieces.
Purchasing Inventory
Purchasing inventory involves performing three actions in QuickBooks:
• Adding the inventory you purchase to an inventory asset account
• Entering the bill you receive for the inventory you bought
• Paying the bill for the inventory

Chapter 20: Managing Inventory
523
PURCHASING 
INVENTORY
FIGURE 20-2
The New Item (or Edit 
Item) window for an 
Inventory Assembly item 
includes minimum and 
maximum Build Point 
fields instead of the 
Reorder Point field that 
inventory items have. As 
you build Inventory As-
sembly items, QuickBooks 
keeps track of how many 
inventory items you use, 
which can trigger a reorder 
reminder. Because you 
build an Inventory Assem-
bly item out of individual 
components, you fill in 
the Build Point (Min) field 
with the minimum number 
of Inventory Assembly 
items you want on hand 
to tell QuickBooks when to 
remind you to build more. 
The Max field specifies the 
maximum number you 
want on hand.
What’s tricky is that you don’t know whether the bill or the inventory will arrive 
first. In many cases, the bill arrives with or after the shipment. But if Samurai Sam 
requires a deposit before he starts crafting your swords, you can record the deposit 
payment you make and then apply that payment when the final bill arrives. In the 
following sections, you’ll learn how to use QuickBooks’ features to handle any order 
of bill and inventory arrival.
Creating Purchase Orders
Before you receive inventory and pay the corresponding bills, it’s a good idea to make 
sure that the shipments you receive match what you ordered—not unlike opening a 
pizza box before you leave the parlor to make sure you didn’t get an anchovy-and-
garlic pie by mistake. Remembering what you ordered is tougher when products and 
quantities vary. Most businesses address this problem by creating purchase orders 
for the inventory they buy. That way, when an order arrives, they can compare the 
shipment with the purchase order to confirm that the items and quantities are correct.

WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Turning Parts into Products
Inventory Assembly items don’t work the way many manufac-
turers treat assembled items. Manufacturers and distributors 
often build batches of assembled items, pool the manufactur-
ing costs for the batch, and then assign a value to the resulting 
batch of products that goes into inventory. To use this approach 
in QuickBooks, you track the parts you use to build products 
(Non-inventory Parts) as assets instead of Inventory Assembly 
items. Here’s how it works:
1.	 As you buy ingredients for a batch, assign the costs 
(via bills and so on) to an asset account specifically for 
inventory you build (such inventory is often referred to 
as WIP for “work in progress”).
2.	 When the batch is complete, choose Vendors→Inventory 
Activities→Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand to make an 
inventory adjustment to add the items you made to 
inventory.
3.	 In the “Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand” window, in the 
Adjustment Type drop-down list, choose “Quantity and 
Total Value.”
4.	 In the Adjustment Account drop-down list, choose the 
asset account for your WIP. 
5.	 In the New Quantity column, type the number of items you 
built from your pool of parts. In the New Value column, 
type the value of the parts you used.
6.	 Click Save & Close to save the adjustment, which places 
the value of the new inventory in your inventory asset 
account. Because the inventory value matches what you 
paid for parts, the value adjustment also reduces the 
WIP asset account’s balance to zero, in effect moving the 
value of your parts from the WIP asset account to your 
inventory asset account.
You have to know how many units you got out of the parts pool, 
so this approach works only if you build products in batches. 
If you constantly manufacture products, you need a program 
other than QuickBooks to track your inventory. To find one, go 
to http://marketplace.intuit.com. On the website’s menu bar, 
click Find Software→Find Solutions by Industry. Then, on the 
By Industry tab, click Manufacturing. Finally, on that same tab 
under the Manufacturing heading, click Inventory Management.
 NOTE 	 You can create all the purchase orders you want without altering the balances in your income, 
expense, and asset accounts; purchase orders don’t appear in your Profit & Loss or Balance Sheet reports, either. 
That’s because purchase orders are known as non-posting transactions: No money changes hands (or accounts), 
so there’s nothing to post in your chart of accounts. In QuickBooks, the first posting for purchased inventory 
happens when you receive either the inventory or the bill.
Because purchase orders are typically the first step in purchasing products, the 
QuickBooks Home Page places the Purchase Orders icon in the pole position in the 
Vendors panel. Click it to open the Create Purchase Orders window, which is like a 
mirror image of the Create Invoices window that you use to invoice your customers 
(page 227). You choose a vendor instead of a customer, and the Ship To address is 
your company’s address, as shown in Figure 20-3.

QuickBooks has one 
predefined template for 
purchase orders, although 
it’s called Custom Purchase

customize your purchase 
order form, at the top of 
the Create Purchase Orders 
window, click the Format-
ting tab, and then click 
Manage Templates. Page 
707 tells the whole story of 
customizing templates.
Here’s how to create a purchase order:
1.	 Choose Vendors→Create Purchase Orders or, on the Home Page, click the 
Purchase Orders icon.
In the Create Purchase Orders window that appears, QuickBooks fills in the 
current date, and there’s no reason to change it because purchase orders are 
merely a paper trail of what you order.
2.	 In the Vendor box’s drop-down list, choose the vendor you’re ordering 
inventory from.
QuickBooks grabs the vendor’s name and address from the vendor’s record and 
uses it to fill in the Vendor address box, as shown in Figure 20-3.
 NOTE 	 If you use multiple currencies, the vendor’s currency appears to the right of the vendor’s name. The 
“Exchange Rate 1 [unit] =” box below the item table becomes active if the vendor is set up to use a currency 
different from your home currency.
3.	 If you use classes to categorize income and expenses (page 636), choose 
a class for the purchase order.
If you use classes and skip the Class box, when you try to save the purchase 
order, QuickBooks might remind you that you didn’t assign a class. If that hap­
pens, click Cancel to return to the purchase order so you can choose a class, or 
click Save Anyway to save the purchase order without a class.

4.	 If you’re ordering inventory that you want shipped directly to one of your 
customers, in the Drop Ship To drop-down list, choose that customer (or job).
If you select a drop-ship address, QuickBooks changes the address in the Ship 
To box from your company’s address to the customer’s or job’s address.
5.	 If you’re creating your first purchase order, in the P.O. No. box, type the 
number you want to start with.
From then on, QuickBooks increments the number in the P.O. No. box by one. 
If you order your products over the phone or through an online system and the 
vendor asks for your purchase order number, give him this number.
6.	 In the first Item cell in the table, choose the item that corresponds to the 
first product you’re purchasing.
The Item drop-down list shows all the entries in your Item List, even though 
many companies create purchase orders only for inventory items. (As you type 
the first few letters of an item’s name, QuickBooks displays matching entries. 
You can keep typing or click the item you want as soon as it appears.)
When you choose an item, QuickBooks fills in other cells in the row with infor­
mation from that item’s record. The Description cell gets filled with the item 
record’s description, which you can keep or edit. The Rate cell grabs the value 
from the Cost field of the item’s record (that’s the price you pay for the item).
7.	 In the Qty cell, type the quantity you want to purchase.
Once you do that, QuickBooks fills in the Amount cell with the total purchase

8.	 If you’re purchasing inventory specifically for a customer or job, choose the 
customer or job in the Customer cell.
The Create Purchase Orders dialog box doesn’t include a cell for designating 
purchases as billable. Don’t worry: You’ll tell QuickBooks that an item is billable 
when you create a bill or receive the item into inventory.
9.	 Repeat steps 6–8 for each product you’re purchasing.
You can add, copy, and delete lines in a purchase order. To do so, right-click in 
the item table, and then choose one of the entries on the shortcut menu:
—
— To add a line, choose Insert Line.
—
— To copy a line, choose Copy Line; then right-click another table row and 
choose Paste Line.

10.	 At the bottom of the Create Purchase Orders dialog box, in the Memo field, 
type a summary of what you’re ordering to help you identify the purchase 
order.
Whatever you type in the Memo field shows up when it’s time to apply a pur­
chase order to a bill (which you’ll learn about shortly), so you can identify the 
right purchase order.
11.	 If you have additional purchase orders to create, click Save & New to save 
the current purchase order and start another.
To save the one you just created and close the Create Purchase Orders window, 
click Save & Close instead. Click Clear to throw out your choices or changes on 
the purchase order.
Receiving Inventory and Bills Simultaneously
For many orders, you’ll find the bill tucked into one of the boxes of your shipment 
like a bonus gift. Although a bill isn’t the most welcome of gifts, receiving a bill and 
inventory simultaneously is a bonus because you can record the inventory and ac­
companying bill in QuickBooks at the same time. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Vendors→“Receive Items and Enter Bill” or, on the Home Page, click 
Receive Inventory, and then choose “Receive Inventory with Bill.”
Either way, QuickBooks opens the Enter Bills window that you first met on page 
184 and automatically turns on the Bill Received checkbox (see Figure 20-4, 
background) just as it does when you create a regular bill.
2.	 In the Vendor drop-down list, choose the vendor who sent the bill.
QuickBooks looks for any open purchase orders for that vendor.
3.	 If there are any open purchase orders for that vendor and you want to apply 
the shipment you received to one of them, in the Open POs Exist message 
box, click Yes. (If the items you received don’t go with any open purchase 
orders, click No and skip to step 5.) If you don’t see this message box, skip 
to step 5.
When you click Yes, QuickBooks opens the Open Purchase Orders dialog box 
(Figure 20-4, foreground), which lists purchase order dates, numbers, and 
memos.
If the vendor’s bill includes the purchase order number, picking the correct one 
is easy. Or, if you filled in the Memo field when you created the purchase order, 
that note may help you identify the right one. But if you don’t know which one 
to pick, click Cancel to close the Open Purchase Orders dialog box. Then, to 
view a report of open purchase orders, head to the right side of the Enter Bills 
window and take a look at the Vendor tab’s Summary section. Click the number 
to the right of the “POs to be received” label, which is actually a link that opens 
a Vendor QuickReport containing the open POs for the vendor you selected in 
step 2. In the report window, double-click a purchase order to view its details.

Once you’ve identified the correct PO, on the Enter Bills window’s Main tab, 
click Select PO to reopen the Open Purchase Orders dialog box.
FIGURE 20-4
In the Enter Bills window, 
when you choose the ven-
dor that shipped the items 
you’ve received (from the 
Vendor drop-down list), 
QuickBooks checks for any 
open purchase orders for 
that vendor. If it finds any, 
it displays the Open POs 
Exist message box (not 
shown here). If you click 
Yes in that box, the Open 
Purchase Orders dialog box 
appears so you can select 
a PO; doing so applies 
the items you’ve received 
from that purchase order 
to the bill.
4.	 In the Open Purchase Orders dialog box’s table, select the purchase order 
that goes with the shipment you received by clicking its checkmark cell (the 
first column), and then click OK.
QuickBooks displays a checkmark in the purchase order’s checkmark cell. When 
you click OK, the program closes the Open Purchase Orders dialog box and fills 
in the bill fields with purchase order info, like the amount and the items ordered, 
as shown in Figure 20-5. When you work from a purchase order, QuickBooks 
displays the order’s number in the PO No. column in the item table (this column 
appears only if you choose a purchase order). To open the selected purchase 
order in the Create Purchase Orders dialog box, click Show PO below the item 
table.

When you choose an 
open purchase order, 
QuickBooks uses the 
information from it to fill 
in fields in the Enter Bills 
window with most of the 
info about the items you 
ordered, such as the item 
table (shown here) and 
the Amount Due field in 
the header (not shown).
 TIP 	 It’s always a good idea to compare the quantities you received in the shipment with the quantities on 
your purchase order. If you received fewer items than you ordered, then in the Qty cell for the item, enter the 
number you actually received and adjust the amount due to match what you received.
5.	 In the Enter Bills window’s Date box, enter the date you received the bill.
If you’ve already defined the payment terms in the vendor’s record (page 84), 
QuickBooks fills in the Terms box and uses those terms to calculate the due 
date in the Bill Due box. If the bill you received shows different terms or a dif­
ferent due date, update the values in the Bill Due and Terms boxes to match 
the vendor’s bill. (When you save the bill, QuickBooks offers to save the new 
terms in the vendor’s record.)
6.	 If you didn’t create a purchase order for the shipment you received, fill in 
the fields as you would for a regular bill.
In the Amount Due field, type the amount due from the vendor’s bill. You’ll also 
have to fill in the item table manually: For each item you received, in a blank 
line of the table, specify the item, quantity, customer or job, and class (if you 
use that feature). QuickBooks fills in the Description and Cost cells by using the 
values in the item’s record, and then calculates the Amount by multiplying the 
quantity by the item’s cost.

7.	 Click Save & New or Save & Close.
When you save a combination inventory/bill transaction, QuickBooks goes to 
work behind the scenes. For the inventory you received, the program debits 
your inventory asset account the amount you paid for the items and updates the 
item’s quantity on hand. It also increases the balance in your Accounts Payable 
account by the amount of the bill.
 TIP 	 If you want to see how many of a particular product you have on hand, on the Home Page, click Items 
& Services. In the Item List window, look at the Total Quantity On Hand column for the item you’re interested in.
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Posting Inventory Received
When you receive inventory before the bill arrives, your ac-
countant might squawk about how QuickBooks posts inven-
tory to your accounts. In standard accounting practice, only 
bills show up as credits to the Accounts Payable account. But 
QuickBooks credits the Accounts Payable account when you 
receive inventory items without a bill.
When you receive items without a bill, QuickBooks adds an en-
try for the items to the Accounts Payable register. (To view the 
register, press Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window, and 
then double-click the Accounts Payable account.) The program 
fills in the Type cell with the text “ITEM RCPT” to indicate that 
the entry isn’t a bill. Later, when you enter the bill, QuickBooks 
edits the same transaction, replacing “ITEM RCPT” with “BILL.”
The result in your company file is correct after you receive 
the inventory and enter the corresponding bill. However, 
your accountant might complain about the incomplete audit 
trail because the transaction changes without some kind of 
record. If you want to track inventory, bills, and price differ-
ences between your purchase orders and the final bills, you 
can do so outside of QuickBooks. Then, once you receive both 
the inventory and the corresponding bill, you can record the 
transaction in QuickBooks.
Receiving Inventory Before the Bill
When you receive inventory, you want to record it in QuickBooks so you know that 
it’s available to sell. If you receive inventory without a bill, the best solution is to 
pretend that you received the bill. By creating the bill in QuickBooks, your Accounts 
Payable stays in sync with what you’ve purchased. Then, once you receive the bill, 
you can edit the QuickBooks bill to match it.
Another approach is to record the received inventory in QuickBooks without a bill. 
(You can do this because the program has separate features for receiving inventory 
and entering bills when they arrive.) The box above explains how QuickBooks posts 
amounts to accounts when you receive inventory without a bill. The fields that you 
specify and the options at your disposal are the same as when you receive inventory 
with a bill (as described in the previous section); they just appear in different windows.
To receive inventory in your company file before the bill arrives:
1.	 Choose Vendors→Receive Items or, on the Home Page, click the Receive 
Inventory icon and then choose “Receive Inventory without Bill.”

QuickBooks opens the Create Item Receipts window, which is a close relative 
of the Enter Bills window. In fact, other than the window’s title, only two things 
are different, both of which are labeled in Figure 20-6.
FIGURE 20-6
Because you’re only 
adding inventory to your 
company file, QuickBooks 
automatically turns off the 
Bill Received checkbox in 
the Create Item Receipts 
window. 
To make it crystal clear 
that you aren’t creating 
a bill, the program 
displays the words “Item 
Receipt” and, in the Memo 
box, adds the message 
“Received items (bill to 
follow).”
 TIP 	 If you open the Create Item Receipts window and then realize that you do have the bill, there’s no need 
to close the window and choose a different feature. Simply turn on the Bill Received checkbox at the window’s 
top right. When you do, the window changes to the Enter Bills window so you can receive the items and create 
the bill (page 530).
Similar to what happens when you receive inventory and a bill at the same time, 
the Create Item Receipts window reminds you about open purchase orders that 
you can select to fill in the items received automatically. The rest of the fields 
behave like the ones in the Enter Bills window, explained on page 527.
2.	 When you’ve added all the items you received and updated any quantities 
that differ from those on your purchase order, click Save & Close.
QuickBooks records the inventory in your company file, as described in the 
box on page 530.

Then, when the bill for the items you received finally arrives, here’s what you do:
1.	 Choose Vendors→“Enter Bill for Received Items,” or on the Home Page, 
click the Enter Bills Against Inventory icon.
The box on page 533 tells you how to recover if you choose Vendors→Enter 
Bills by mistake.
2.	 In the Select Item Receipt dialog box, choose the vendor that sent the 
shipment; then select the shipment that corresponds to the bill you just 
received and click OK.
QuickBooks opens the Enter Bills window and fills in the fields with info from 
your Receive Items transaction.
 TIP 	 The Select Item Receipt dialog box’s Ref. No. and Memo columns identify the shipments you’ve received. 
If those columns are blank, the Date column won’t be enough to let you select the right item receipt, so click 
Cancel, and then choose Vendors→Receive Items. At the top of the Create Item Receipts window, click the left 
arrow (Previous) or right arrow (Next) to display the item receipt you want, and then fill in its Memo box or Ref. 
No. box with the purchase order number for the shipment or the carrier’s tracking number. After you save the 
item receipt with an identifying memo or reference number, choose Vendors→“Enter Bill for Received Items” 
once more.
3.	 If the prices and quantities on the vendor’s bill are different from those 
QuickBooks used, in the item table, update the prices and quantities.
When prices and quantities differ, don’t take the vendor’s bill as the final word—
check your record to see where the discrepancy arose.
4.	 If the bill includes sales tax and shipping that you didn’t include on your 
purchase order, click the Expenses tab in the lower part of the window, and 
then fill in additional lines for those charges.
If you change anything on the window’s Items or Expenses tab, at the top of 
the Create Item Receipts window, click Recalculate to update the Amount Due 
field with the new total.
5.	 Click Save & Close.
You’ll see a message box asking if you want to save the changes you made—even 
if you didn’t make any. QuickBooks asks this question because it changed the 
item receipt transaction to a bill in your Accounts Payable account, as the box 
on page 533 explains. Click Yes to save the changes.

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Double (Posting) Trouble
When you want to enter a bill for items you received earlier, 
be extra careful to choose Vendors→“Enter Bill for Received 
Items” (or click Enter Bills Against Inventory on the Home Page). 
If you choose Vendors→Enter Bills instead, you’ll end up with 
two postings for the same items in your Accounts Payable ac-
count. The first posting appears when you receive the items in 
QuickBooks (the one identified with the ITEM RCPT type); the 
second posting is for the bill.
If you accidentally create one of these double entries, here’s 
how to correct the problem:
1.	 In the Chart of Accounts window, double-click the 
Accounts Payable account.
2.	 In the Accounts Payable register, select the bill, and then 
choose Edit→Delete Bill; alternatively, right-click the 
bill, and then choose Delete Bill on the shortcut menu.
3.	 Recreate the bill using the “Enter Bill for Received Items” 
feature (page 532).
Selling Inventory
You don’t have to jump through hoops to sell inventory. When you add inventory 
items to invoices (Chapter 10), sales receipts (Chapter 13), or other sales forms 
(Chapter 11), QuickBooks deducts the units you sold from each item’s Total Quan­
tity On Hand value. The income from the sale posts to an income account, while 
the cost of the units you sold moves from the inventory asset account to a cost of 
goods sold account.
When you sell inventory, QuickBooks also compares the new Total Quantity On 
Hand value with your minimum reorder point (page 521). When the inventory on 
hand drops below this number, the program reminds you that it’s time to order 
more (page 485). (If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, the program will 
tell you how many to order based on the item’s maximum reorder point.) The box 
below tells you how to shut off reminders for items you aren’t selling at the moment.
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Managing Seasonal Items
The Item List is home to items for every service and product you 
sell, and it can get really long really fast, especially if you sell 
different items at different times of the year. For example, if 
you stock your store with lawn furniture in the spring, you don’t 
want to scroll past dozens of outdoor items or see reminders to 
reorder them the other nine months of the year.
Fortunately, you can make seasonal items inactive, which 
temporarily hides them in the Item List and silences their 
reminders. In the Item List window (Lists→Item List), right-
click the item, and then choose Make Item Inactive from the 
shortcut menu. Page 119 explains how to reactivate items when 
a new season rolls around.

RUNNING

REPORTS
Running Inventory Reports
Checking the vital signs of your inventory is the best way to keep it healthy. When 
products are hot, you have to keep them in stock or you’ll lose sales. And if products 
grow cold, you don’t want to get stuck holding the bag (or the lime-green luggage).
Most companies keep tabs on inventory trends and compare them with what’s going 
on in sales. For example, when the value of your inventory asset account is increasing 
faster than sales, sales could be poor because your prices are too high, competition 
is encroaching on your market, or your spy-cam necklaces simply didn’t catch on.
Good inventory management means keeping enough items in stock to meet your 
sales, but not so many that your inventory grows obsolete before you can sell it. 
QuickBooks inventory reports aren’t fancy, but they tell you most of what you 
need to know. You can run any of these reports by choosing Reports→Purchases 
or Reports→Inventory and then picking the one you want. The following sections 
describe what each report includes.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks inventory reports show only the active inventory items in your Item List. So if you run 
inventory reports without reactivating all your inventory items (page 119), the values in the reports won’t be 
accurate. By contrast, financial statements such as the Balance Sheet include your total inventory value for active 
and inactive inventory items alike.
Purchases Reports
These reports, not surprisingly, are listed under Reports→Purchases. When you run 
the Purchases by Vendor Summary report and see high dollar values, you might 
want to negotiate volume discounts or faster delivery times. This report can also 
show when you rely too heavily on one vendor—a big risk should that vendor go 
out of business.
The Purchases by Item Summary report shows how many inventory items you’ve 
bought and the total you paid. (This report also comes in handy if you want to use 
LIFO or FIFO to calculate inventory value, as explained on page 544.) The Purchases 
by Item Detail report shows each purchase transaction, along with the quantity, 
cost, and vendor.
If your supplies are dwindling, the Open Purchase Orders report shows when more 
items are due. (You can also run this report from the Enter Bills window: Click the 
Reports tab at the top of the window, and then click the Open Purchase Order 
Detail icon.) The report displays the PO’s date, vendor, number, and delivery date. 
Double-click a purchase order to open the Create Purchase Orders window, which 
shows the products included in that order.
How Much Is Inventory Worth?
QuickBooks includes two reports that tell you how much your inventory is worth: 
Inventory Valuation Summary and Inventory Valuation Detail. Here’s what each 
one does.

Chapter 20: Managing Inventory
535
RUNNING 
INVENTORY 
REPORTS
INVENTORY VALUATION SUMMARY REPORT
The Inventory Valuation Summary report, shown in Figure 20-7, is an overview of the 
inventory you have on hand, what it’s worth as an asset, and what it will be worth 
when you sell it. (See page 544 to find out what to do if your inventory isn’t worth 
as much as it used to be.)
FIGURE 20-7
Because the report is a 
snapshot of inventory 
value, month-to-date, 
quarter-to-date, and 
year-to-date ranges all 
produce the same results. 
But if you want to see the 
inventory value as of a 
different date, in the Dates 
box, choose the one you 
want.
To run this report, choose Reports→Inventory→Inventory Valuation Summary or 
(if you have QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise) at the top right of the Inventory 
Center (Vendors→Inventory Activities→Inventory Center), click the Inventory Valu­
ation Summary link. QuickBooks initially uses the current month to date as the date 
range for this report. The first column shows the names of the inventory items from 
your Item List; subitems appear indented beneath their parent items. Here are the 
report’s other columns and why they are (or aren’t) important to inventory health:
• On Hand. To calculate this value, QuickBooks subtracts the number of products 
you sold and adds the number of products you received. The values in this 
column can help you quickly check for items that are out of or close to being 
out of stock. However, because items sell at different rates, the reorder point 
reminder (page 521) is a better indication than this column that something is 
perilously close to selling out.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
536
RUNNING 
INVENTORY 
REPORTS
 NOTE 	 When you add an out-of-stock item to an invoice, QuickBooks warns that you don’t have inventory, 
but it doesn’t prevent you from invoicing for products you don’t have. When the On Hand value is negative, you 
know it’s time to order more—and to ask for express shipping.
• Avg Cost. Average cost is the only way QuickBooks Pro and Premier value 
inventory. (QuickBooks Enterprise can perform “first in/first out” valuation; 
see page 546.) To calculate this value, the program uses the price you paid for 
every unit you’ve purchased of an inventory item along with any adjustment 
transactions you’ve recorded (page 544). If you want to watch price trends so 
you can adjust your sales prices accordingly, review your most recent bills for 
inventory purchases.
• Asset Value. This is the item’s average cost multiplied by the number on hand. 
Although changes in asset value over time are more telling, a snapshot of asset 
value can show trouble brewing. An excessive asset value for an item is a sign 
that inventory might be obsolete—the item hasn’t sold, so you have too many on 
hand. If you know that the item is selling, streamlining your purchasing process 
can reduce the number you need to keep in the warehouse.
• % of Tot Asset. This column shows the percentage of an item’s asset value 
compared with the total asset value of all your inventory items. Higher percent­
ages might mean that a product is a significant part of your sales strategy or 
that it isn’t selling well and you have too many in stock. This measurement has 
meaning only in light of your business strategy and performance.
• Sales Price. You set this price in the item’s record, but it’s meaningless if you 
regularly change the item’s price or charge different prices to different custom­
ers. If you didn’t set a sales price for an item, you’ll see “0.00” in this column.
• Retail Value. Because an item’s retail value is its sales price multiplied by the 
number on hand, this number is useful only if the value in the Sales Price column 
is the typical sales price for the item.
• % of Tot Retail. This percentage is what portion of your total inventory’s retail 
value the item’s retail value represents. Different products sell at different profit 
margins, which you can see when the value in this column differs from the value 
in the % of Tot Asset column.
INVENTORY VALUATION DETAIL REPORT
This report (Reports→Inventory→Inventory Valuation Detail) lists every transaction 
that increases or decreases the number of items you have on hand. Although it can 
grow lengthy, this report can help you figure out where your inventory went (and 
perhaps jog your memory about inventory transactions that you forgot to record in 
QuickBooks). As in other reports, you can double-click a transaction to see its details.

Inventory Stock Status
As you might expect, the Inventory Stock Status by Item report (Reports→Inventory 
→Inventory Stock Status by Item) tells you where your inventory stands today and 
how it will change based on your outstanding purchase orders. As Figure 20-8 shows, 
this report is a great way to see which items you need to reorder.
 TIP 	 If you want to use a barcode reader to scan your inventory, go to Intuit’s marketplace (http://marketplace.
intuit.com). In either Search Apps Now box, type barcode to find third-party barcode readers.
FIGURE 20-8
For every active inventory 
item, this report shows its 
minimum reorder point 
in the Reorder Pt (Min) 
column (and, if you use 
QuickBooks Premier or 
Enterprise, the maximum 
reorder point in the Max 
column) and the number 
you currently have in stock 
in the On Hand column. 
However, a checkmark in 
the Order column is the 
most obvious sign that you 
need to reorder. 
If you’ve added an item to 
a purchase order, the On 
PO column shows whether 
the quantity in that ship-
ment is enough to restock 
your warehouse.
You can also run the Inventory Stock Status by Vendor report to see the same infor­
mation that’s in the Inventory Stock Status by Item report, but grouped and subto­
taled by vendor. If you seem to run low on products from a particular vendor, you 
might want to increase the minimum reorder point for those products to fine-tune 
your lead time. (If you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, you might raise the 
minimum reorder point so you can get a new order in time and raise the maximum 
reorder point so the order that comes in lasts awhile.)
 NOTE 	 If you upgrade to QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, the Inventory Stock Status reports also show 
how many items you’ve added to sales orders for future delivery.

Viewing One Inventory Item
The Inventory Item QuickReport is a fast yet thorough way to see what’s going on 
with a particular item. To display this report, open the Item List window (Lists→Item 
List), select the item you want to review, and then press Ctrl+Q or, at the bottom 
of the window, click Reports→“QuickReport: [item name].” Alternatively, if you use 
QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, in the Inventory Center (Vendors→Inventory 
Activities→Inventory Center), select the item, and then click the QuickReport link 
in the window’s upper right.
This report includes purchase and sales transactions for the item, such as bills and 
invoices (see Figure 20-9). In the On Hand As Of section, invoice transactions repre­
sent the sales you’ve made to customers, so the numbers are negative; bills and item 
receipts are your purchases from vendors, which increase the number on hand. The 
On Purchase Order As Of section includes the number of products you’ve ordered 
but haven’t yet received. And the Total As Of figure at the bottom of the report tells 
you how many products you’ll have in stock when all your purchase orders are filled.
FIGURE 20-9
This report summarizes 
how many of an item you 
have on hand and the 
number on order. 
In the leftmost column, the 
headings at the beginning 
of each section show the 
last day before the date 
range you select, such as 
“On Hand As Of 02/28/15” 
as shown here. Then the 
report lists the transac-
tions during the report’s 
date range that affect a 
total, such as invoice and 
item receipts for the On 
Hand As Of section. The Tot 
On Hand As Of and Total As 
Of labels show the actual 
as-of date for the report, 
along with the final total 
for the inventory item.

To edit an item’s fields, 
click the Edit button (the 
pencil icon). To run inven-
tory reports, click one of 
the links in the window’s 
upper right, such as Stock 
Status or Inventory Valua-
tion Summary.
• Display inventory items. When you first open the Inventory Center, QuickBooks 
displays your active Inventory Part items (and Inventory Assembly items, if you 
use them) in the panel on the left. Then, when you click the name of an inven­
tory item in that panel, the Inventory Information section at the window’s top 
right shows info from that item’s record.
• Filter the list of inventory items. To narrow the list to the items that fit the 
criteria you want, such as inventory items that are out of stock, in the center’s 
toolbar, click the unlabeled filter box that’s located immediately below the New 
Inventory Item entry (it’s labeled in Figure 20-10). In the drop-down list, choose 
one of the entries, like “QOH < = zero,” which is shorthand for “Quantity on hand 
is less than or equal to zero.”
• Find an inventory item in the list. If you have scads of inventory items, you can 
quickly find the one you want with the find box, which is the second unlabeled 
box in the left-hand panel. Simply type part of the item’s name, and then press 
Enter or click the Search button, which has a magnifying glass on it.

Performing a Physical Inventory
QuickBooks calculates how many products you have on hand based on your pur­
chases and sales, but it has no way of knowing what’s actually happening in your 
warehouse. Employees may help themselves to products; fire can consume some 
of your inventory; or a burst pipe could turn your India ink sketches into Rorschach 
tests. Only a physical count of the items in stock can tell you how many units you 
really have on hand.
QuickBooks does the only thing it can to help you count your inventory: provide 
the Physical Inventory Worksheet report, which lists each inventory item in your 
Item List and how many units should be on hand. To see it, choose Reports→ 
Inventory→Physical Inventory Worksheet (or, if you have QuickBooks Premier or 
Enterprise, click the Physical Inventory Worksheet link in the Inventory Center’s up­
per right). The worksheet’s Physical Count column has blank lines so you can write 
in how many you find, as you can see in Figure 20-11. (The box on page 541 explains 
how to count inventory while business continues to chug along.)

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Freezing Inventory While You Count
It’s sheer madness to ship customer orders out and receive 
inventory shipments while you’re trying to count the products 
you have on hand. QuickBooks doesn’t have a feature for freez-
ing inventory while you perform a physical count, but you can 
follow procedures that do the same thing.
Because physical inventory counts disrupt business operations, 
most companies schedule them during slow periods and off 
hours. To keep the disruption to a minimum, print the Physical 
Inventory Worksheet just before you start the count. Then do 
the following to keep your inventory stable:
• Sales. During the count, create invoices in QuickBooks for 
inventory sales as you would normally. After you save 
each invoice, edit it to mark it as pending (page 261). 
When you finish the count, edit the pending invoices 
again to mark them as final, fill the orders, and then 
send the invoices.
• Purchases. If you receive inventory shipments during the 
count, don’t unpack the boxes or use any of QuickBooks’ 
features for receiving inventory (page 527) until you’re 
done with the count.

Adjusting Inventory in QuickBooks
Your inventory records in QuickBooks may not match your real-world inventory for 
several reasons:
• Damage. Inventory can break or get damaged by a flood, an out-of-control 
forklift, or a paintball fight in the warehouse. When these accidents happen, 
the first thing to do is report the loss to your insurance company. Adjusting the 
quantity of inventory in QuickBooks should follow close behind.
• Obsolete products. If you have several cases of oversized, low-resolution 
webcams, the true value of that inventory is almost nothing. Writing them off 
as unsellable turns that inventory into a business expense, which reduces your 
net profit and, therefore, the taxes you pay. Adjust the inventory in QuickBooks 
when you take the products to the recycling center.
• Theft. An inventory adjustment is in order after almost every physical inven­
tory count you perform, because the actual inventory quantities rarely match 
the quantities in QuickBooks. Shrinkage is the polite term for the typical cause 
of these discrepancies. To be blunt, employees, repair people, and passersby 
attracted by an unlocked door may help themselves to a five-finger discount. 
And you not only take the hit to your bottom line—you’re also stuck adjusting 
QuickBooks’ records to account for the theft.
It’s no surprise, then, that QuickBooks has a feature for this multipurpose account­
ing task. You adjust both the quantity of inventory and its value in the aptly named 
“Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand” window.
You purchase inventory from vendors, so QuickBooks keeps all inventory features 
in the same place: the Vendors menu. To open the “Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand” 
window, choose Vendors→Inventory Activities→“Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand” 
or, in the Home Page’s Company panel, click Inventory Activities→“Adjust Quantity/
Value On Hand.”
Adjusting Quantities
You need to adjust quantities when you’re writing off obsolete inventory or updat­
ing your company file to reflect the number of items in stock. When you adjust 
inventory quantities, QuickBooks fills in or calculates some of the fields for you. 
Here are guidelines for filling in the remaining fields of the “Adjust Quantity/Value 
on Hand” window:
• Adjustment Type. To adjust inventory items’ quantities to match what’s in 
your warehouse or reflect what you’re writing off, choose Quantity from this 
drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 20-12. QuickBooks uses the average cost 
of each item to calculate the dollar value that the new quantities represent.
• Adjustment Date. QuickBooks puts the current date in this box. If you like to 
keep your journal entries and other bookkeeping adjustments together at the 

Chapter 20: Managing Inventory

end of a quarter or year, enter the date when you want to record the adjust­
ment instead.
FIGURE 20-12
In this window’s table, 
QuickBooks shades the col-
umns you can’t change. 
When you choose Quantity 
in the Adjustment Type 
box (circled), the Item, 
New Quantity, and Qty 
Difference columns are the 
only ones you can edit.
• Adjustment Account. Choose an expense account you created to track the cost 
of inventory adjustments. For example, if you adjust an item’s quantity to match 
the physical count, choose an expense account such as Inventory Adjustment. If 
you’re writing off obsolete or damaged inventory, choose an expense account 
such as Unsalable Inventory. (Because you can assign only one account to each 
inventory adjustment, adjust the quantity once for physical count changes, and 
then click Save & New to create a separate adjustment for write-offs.)
 TIP 	 If the expense account you want to use doesn’t exist, at the top of the Adjustment Account drop-down 
list, choose <Add New>, and then fill in the boxes in the Add New Account window. When you click Save & Close, 
QuickBooks fills in the Adjustment Account box with the account you just created.
• Reference Number. You don’t have to enter reference numbers, but they come 
in handy when discussing your books with your accountant. If you don’t type 
anything in this box, QuickBooks sets it to 1 and then increments the number 
here by one each time you adjust inventory.
• Customer:Job. If you want to record products you send to a customer or job at 
no charge—without adding those items to an invoice—choose that customer or 
job in this drop-down list. QuickBooks then assigns the cost of the adjustment 
to that customer or job.

544
ADJUSTING 
INVENTORY IN 
QUICKBOOKS
 TIP 	 A better way to give products to a customer or job is to add them to an invoice with a price of $0.00. 
That way, your generosity remains on the record lest your customer forgets.
• Class. If you use classes to track sales, choose the appropriate one in this box. 
For example, if one partner handles sales for the item you’re adjusting, choose 
the class for that partner so the expense applies to her.
• Item. To adjust a single item, click the first item cell in the table, click the down 
arrow that appears, and then choose the inventory item you want to adjust. To 
adjust several items, click the Find & Select Items button above the table. In 
the Find & Select Items dialog box, turn on the checkmark cells for each item 
you want to adjust (or click Select All to select all your inventory items after a 
physical count), and then click Add Selected Items.
• New Quantity/Qty Difference. When you choose Quantity in the Adjustment 
Type box, you can type a number in either the New Quantity or the Qty Dif­
ference cell. (When you type a value in one of these columns, QuickBooks 
automatically calculates the value in the other column.) If you’re making an 
adjustment after a physical count, in the New Quantity cell, type the quantity 
from your physical count worksheet. On the other hand, if you lost two cases 
of webcams, it’s easier to type the number you lost as a negative number (such 
as –20) in the Qty Difference cell. 
 TIP 	 If you’re ready to admit that the pet rock fad isn’t coming back, you can write off your entire inventory 
by putting 0 in an item’s New Quantity cell. In the Adjustment Account drop-down list, choose an expense account 
such as Unsalable Inventory.
• Memo. To prevent questions from your accountant, in the Memo cell, type the 
reason for the adjustment, such as “2015 end-of-year physical count.”
After you fill in all the boxes, click Save & Close (or Save & New if you want to 
create a second adjustment for write-offs, say). If you decreased the quantity on 
hand, QuickBooks decreases the balance in your inventory asset account (using the 
average cost per item). To keep double-entry bookkeeping principles intact, the 
decrease in the inventory asset account also shows up as an increase in the expense 
account you chose. Conversely, if the adjustment increases the quantity or value 
of your inventory, the inventory asset account’s balance increases and the expense 
account’s balance decreases.
Adjusting Quantities and Values
Calculating inventory values by using the items’ average cost is convenient—and 
in QuickBooks Pro and Premier, it’s your only option. Using other methods for cal­
culating inventory value, like “first in/first out” (FIFO) and “last in/first out” (LIFO) 
costing (explained in the box on page 546), quickly turn into a full-time job. But if 
that’s what you want, you can do so manually.

Chapter 20: Managing Inventory
545
ADJUSTING 
INVENTORY IN 
QUICKBOOKS
 NOTE 	 You can value inventory using FIFO if you upgrade to QuickBooks Enterprise and subscribe to Intuit’s 
Advanced Inventory service (which costs extra).
Because QuickBooks can handle only average cost for inventory, your sole work­
around for achieving LIFO or FIFO costing is to adjust dollar values by hand in the 
“Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand” window (Vendors→Inventory Activities→“Adjust 
Quantity/Value on Hand”). When you choose Total Value in the window’s Adjustment 
Type box, QuickBooks displays the New Value column. You can then change the 
asset value of the quantity on hand simply by typing the new value in that column.
You can also change both quantities and values to, for example, make the quantity 
reflect what’s in your warehouse and the value reflect the items’ poor condition. To do 
this, in the Adjustment Type box, choose “Quantity and Total Value.” QuickBooks then 
activates the New Quantity, Qty Difference, and New Value columns. To change the 
number you have, type the value in the New Quantity cell. To adjust an item’s value, 
in the New Value cell for that item, type the dollar value for the quantity on hand.
Mimicking LIFO or FIFO costing takes some effort because you have to review the 
bills for all your purchases of the inventory item. Here’s how to value your inventory 
using LIFO:
1.	 Choose Reports→Purchases→Purchases by Item Detail.
QuickBooks generates a report that shows your purchase transactions grouped 
by inventory item.
2.	 For the quantity of the item that you have on hand, add up the prices you 
paid for your most recent purchases.
The Purchases by Item Detail report’s Cost Price column shows how much you 
paid for an item with each purchase. Say you need to know the LIFO value for 
10 security stations for your tax return. As shown in Figure 20-13, the first 20 
security stations cost $999.95 each, and the last four cost $750.00 each. So the 
LIFO value for the last 10 security stations would be 4 multiplied by $750.00 
and 6 multiplied by $999.95, or $8,999.70.
3.	 In the “Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand” window (Vendors→Inventory 
Activities→“Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand”), type the amount you just 
calculated into the New Value cell.
When you click Save & Close, QuickBooks decreases the balance in your inven­
tory asset account using the value in the New Value cell instead of the average 
cost per item.

UP TO SPEED
FIFO and LIFO Inventory Costing
First in/first out (FIFO) costing means that a company values 
its inventory as if the first products it receives are the first 
ones it sells. (Your grocery store always puts the milk closest 
to its expiration date at the front of the refrigerator, right?)
Last in/first out (LIFO) costing, on the other hand, assumes 
that the last products in are the first ones sold. This method 
is like unpacking a moving van: The last valuables you packed 
are the first ones that come out.
The costing method you use doesn’t have to match the order 
in which you sell products. When you start a business, you can 
choose whichever costing method you want—but you have to 
stick with it. For example, when prices are on the rise (as they 
almost always are), LIFO costing reduces your profit and taxes 
owed because you’re selling the products that cost the most 
first. However, with the steady decrease in electronics prices, 
FIFO costing probably produces the least profit. Unless you’re 
sure which method you want to use, you’re better off asking 
your accountant for advice.
Unfortunately, even with the “Adjust Quantity/Value on 
Hand” window, you can’t achieve true LIFO or FIFO costing in 
QuickBooks Pro or Premier. The program always uses average 
cost to move money from your inventory asset account to 
your cost of goods sold account when you add products to an 
invoice or sales receipt

CHAPTER
21
S
ales tax can be complicated, particularly in states where the number of tax 
authorities has exploded. You might have to pay sales taxes to several agen­
cies, each with its own rules about when and how much. QuickBooks’ sales tax 
features can’t eliminate this drudgery, but they can help you pay the right tax au­
thorities the right amounts at the right time—and that’s something to be thankful for.
QuickBooks can help you track sales tax based on customers’ locations and sales-
tax-paying status. The program can also keep track of non-taxable sales. This chapter 
shows you how to set up the program to handle all these tasks.
Once the sales tax setup is done, QuickBooks takes over and calculates the sales 
taxes due on invoices and sales receipts you create. However, after you collect sales 
taxes from your customers, you need to send those funds to the appropriate tax 
agencies. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to remit sales taxes to the right organiza­
tions on the schedules they require.
Setting Up Sales Tax
If you have to work with sales tax, the first step is turning on the QuickBooks sales 
tax preference. Then you set up sales tax codes and items to tell the program about 
the taxes you need to collect and remit. This section shows you how to get started.
Turning on QuickBooks Sales Tax
When you created your company file, QuickBooks may have turned on sales tax 
for you if the industry you selected typically tracks sales tax. But if you just started

SETTING UP 
SALES TAX
selling taxable goods, you have to turn on the program’s sales tax features yourself. 
Here are the steps:
1.	 Choose Edit→Preferences→Sales Tax, and then click the Company Prefer­
ences tab.
Because sales tax applies to your entire company file, you need administrator 
privileges to change the sales tax setting.
2.	 To the right of the “Do you charge sales tax?” label, select the Yes radio 
button.
If you click OK to close the Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks tells you that 
you need to specify your most common Sales Tax item. Click OK to close the 
message box, and then proceed to the next step.
3.	 In the Preferences dialog box’s “Your most common sales tax item” drop-down 
list, choose the Sales Tax item or Sales Tax Group item (described on page 553) 
you apply to most of your customers, if one exists, and then skip to step 6.
If you’re just getting started with sales tax, this drop-down list will contain only 
the <Add New> entry, because you haven’t set up Sales Tax items yet. (If you 
don’t know what Sales Tax items are, jump to page 552 to learn about them and 
their siblings: sales tax codes. After you do that, proceed to step 4.)
4.	 If you need to set up a Sales Tax item, in the Preferences dialog box’s “Your 
most common Sales Tax item” drop-down list, choose <Add New>.
The New Item dialog box opens.
5.	 In the New Item dialog box, fill in the boxes to create a new Sales Tax item 
(see page 553 for details), and then click OK.
In the Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks fills in the “Your most common Sales 
Tax item” box with the item you just created.
6.	 Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
At this point, the Updating Sales Tax dialog box may appear. In this dialog box, 
QuickBooks automatically turns on the “Make all existing customers taxable” 
and “Make all existing non-inventory and inventory parts taxable” checkboxes. 
If most of your customers and the products you sell are subject to sales tax, 
leave these checkboxes turned on and click OK to close the message box. Then 
click OK in the message box telling you that QuickBooks must close all open 
windows to change the sales tax preference.
Sales tax is now turned on in your company file, so you can create additional sales 
tax items and codes, as described on page 552 and page 551, respectively.
 TIP 	 The Manage Sales Tax window (choose Vendors→Sales Tax→Manage Sales Tax) guides you through 
your sales tax tasks from start to finish. For example, click the window’s Sales Tax Preferences button to open 
the Preferences dialog box directly to the Sales Tax category’s Company Preferences tab.

Chapter 21: Working with Sales Tax
549
SETTING UP 
SALES TAX
Other Sales Tax Preferences
Some of the sales tax preference settings aren’t up to you. Tax agencies decide 
when your sales taxes are due, usually based on how much sales tax you collect. 
When you receive a notice about your required payment interval from the state 
or other tax authority, be sure to update your QuickBooks preferences to match. 
After you set these preferences and then add sales tax to an invoice for the first 
time, QuickBooks automatically creates a liability account in your chart of accounts 
called Sales Tax Payable.
In the Preferences dialog box, on the Sales Tax category’s Company Preferences 
tab, QuickBooks provides two sets of payment options to satisfy the tax agencies 
you’re beholden to:
• When do you owe sales tax? If your tax agency deems sales taxes due when 
you add them to customer invoices (known as accrual basis payment), choose 
the “As of invoice date (Accrual Basis)” option. If your tax agency says sales 
taxes are due when your customers pay them (known as cash basis payment), 
choose the “Upon receipt of payment (Cash Basis)” option instead. When you 
generate sales tax reports (explained on page 554), QuickBooks uses the set­
ting you chose to calculate the sales taxes you have to remit.
• When do you pay sales tax? Tax agencies determine how frequently you have 
to remit sales taxes based on how much sales tax you collect. If your sales 
taxes are only a few dollars, you might pay only once a year. But if you collect 
thousands of dollars of sales tax, you can be sure that the tax agency wants 
its money more quickly, such as quarterly or monthly. When your tax agency 
informs you of your remittance frequency, choose Monthly, Quarterly, or An­
nually here, as appropriate.
Setting Up Sales Tax Features
QuickBooks has two features for dealing with sales tax, codes and items:
• Sales tax codes specify whether an item you sell is taxable—that is, whether 
QuickBooks calculates sales tax for the item when you add it to a sales form. 
You also apply these codes to customers to specify whether they must pay 
sales tax or are exempt.
• Sales Tax items, on the other hand, provide the nitty-gritty detail: They let you 
calculate and organize sales taxes charged by state and local authorities for the 
items on your invoices and other sales forms.
This section describes both features and how to use them.
 TIP 	 If you sell products in a place burdened with multiple sales taxes (state, city, and local, say), you can use 
a Sales Tax Group item to calculate the total sales tax you have to charge. That way, your sales form shows only 
the total tax, but QuickBooks keeps track of what you owe to each agency. See the box on page 553 for details.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
550
SETTING UP 
SALES TAX
For most product sales in most areas, you have to keep track of the sales taxes you 
collect and then send them to the appropriate tax agencies. Labor usually isn’t tax­
able, whereas products usually are. (Groceries are a notable nontaxable exception.) 
To simplify applying sales tax to the right items or subtotals on your invoices, create 
separate items for the things you sell that are taxable and the things that are non­
taxable. After you assign sales tax codes to your items and customers, QuickBooks 
takes care of calculating the sales tax that’s due, as shown in the Create Invoices 
window in Figure 21-1.
FIGURE 21-1
QuickBooks fills in the 
Tax column of the invoice 
table with tax codes from 
the items’ records. The 
program also fills in the 
Customer Tax Code box 
and Tax box with the 
sales tax code and Sales 
Tax item assigned to the 
customer’s record. Then, 
if the customer is taxable, 
it calculates the sales tax 
due by multiplying the 
total taxable amount on 
the invoice by the Sales 
Tax item’s rate.
Sales Tax Codes
Sales tax codes are QuickBooks’ way of letting you specify whether to apply sales 
tax. Out of the box, the program’s Sales Tax Code List comes with two self-explan­
atory options: Tax and Non. If a tax agency requires you to report different types 
of nontaxable sales, you can add more options, as explained on page 551. You can 
apply tax codes to customers and to individual items you sell to designate whether 
sales taxes apply.
ASSIGNING TAX CODES TO CUSTOMERS
Nonprofit organizations and government agencies are usually tax-exempt, meaning 
they don’t have to pay sales taxes. To tell QuickBooks whether a customer pays sales 
tax, open the Edit Customer window (page 41), click the Sales Tax Settings tab, and 
then choose the appropriate option in the Tax Code field. Here’s how QuickBooks 
interprets a customer’s sales tax status:
• Nontaxable customer. When you assign Non or another nontaxable sales tax 
code to customers, QuickBooks doesn’t calculate sales tax on any items you 

Chapter 21: Working with Sales Tax
551
SETTING UP 
SALES TAX
sell to them. For example, in a sales form, when you choose a non-taxable 
customer, the program changes all the Tax cells in the form’s line-item table to 
Non, which means that the calculated sales tax is zero regardless of the items’ 
taxable statuses.
• Taxable customer. When you assign Tax or any taxable sales tax code to cus­
tomers, QuickBooks uses items’ sales tax codes to determine whether to charge 
sales tax; it calculates sales tax only on the taxable items on their invoices and 
other sales forms.
 NOTE 	 Customers who buy products for resale usually don’t pay sales tax because that would tax the products 
twice. (Who says tax authorities don’t have hearts?) To bypass sales tax for a customer, choose Non (for “nontax­
able sales”) in the Tax Code drop-down list, and then type the customer’s resale number in the Resale No. field. 
That way, if tax auditors pay you a visit, the resale number tells them where the sales tax burden should fall.
ASSIGNING TAX CODES TO ITEMS
Some items aren’t taxable regardless of whether a customer pays sales tax. For ex­
ample, most services and essential goods like food don’t get taxed in most states. If 
you look carefully at the invoice in Figure 21-1, you’ll notice the code “Non” or “Tax” 
to the right of each amount. QuickBooks applies the sales tax only to items you 
designate as taxable to calculate the sales taxes on the invoice.
Items include a Tax Code field so you can designate them as taxable or nontaxable. 
To assign a tax code to an item, in the Create Item or Edit Item window (page 106), 
choose a code in the Tax Code drop-down list.
 NOTE 	 Taxable and nontaxable items can live together peacefully assigned to the same income account. 
QuickBooks figures out what to do with sales taxes based on the sales tax codes and Sales Tax items you’ve as­
signed to customers and the sales tax codes you’ve assigned to the items you’ve added to customers’ invoices 
or sales receipts.
CREATING ADDITIONAL SALES TAX CODES
The two built-in sales tax codes, Non and Tax, pretty much cover all possibilities, 
but you may need to create additional codes to classify nontaxable customers by 
their reason for exemption (nonprofit, government, wholesaler, out-of-state, and so 
on) to satisfy tax agencies’ reporting requirements. If that’s the case, here’s how to 
create additional sales tax codes in QuickBooks:
1.	 Choose Lists→Sales Tax Code List.
QuickBooks opens the Sales Tax Code List window.
2.	 To create a new code, press Ctrl+N or, at the bottom of the window, click 
Sales Tax Code→New.
The New Sales Tax Code window opens.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
552
SETTING UP 
SALES TAX
3.	 In the Sales Tax Code box, type a one- to three-character code.
For example, type Gov for government agencies, Whl for wholesalers who resell 
your products, Npf for nonprofit customers, and so on.
4.	 In the Description box, add some details about the code.
Type a description that explains the purpose of the code, like Government for 
Gov.
5.	 Select the Taxable or Non-Taxable radio button.
Sales tax codes are limited to taxable or nontaxable status.
6.	 If you want to add another code, click Next and repeat steps 3–5.
7.	 When you’ve added all the codes you want, click OK to close the New Sales 
Tax Code window.
The codes you created appear in the Sales Tax Code List window.
As you can see, QuickBooks’ sales tax codes don’t let you specify a sales tax per­
centage or note which tax office to send the collected sales taxes to. That’s where 
Sales Tax items (described next) come into play.
Sales Tax Items
QuickBooks’ built-in sales tax codes are fine for designating taxable status, but 
you also have to tell QuickBooks the rate and which tax authority levies the tax. 
If you sell products in more than one tax location, Sales Tax items are the way to 
deal with varying tax regulations. (Like the IRS, each tax agency wants to receive 
the taxes it’s due.) To track what you owe, create a Sales Tax item for each sales 
tax you must collect.
For example, suppose both local and state taxes apply to products you sell in your 
store. For customers to whom you ship goods in other states, sales taxes for those 
states apply. You can create separate Sales Tax items for the tax that applies to 
your store and the state sales taxes for each state in which you do business. Or, if 
you have to collect several sales taxes, QuickBooks has a Sales Tax Group feature 
(page 553) so you can collect them all regardless of which tax authorities levy them.
Unlike sales tax codes, which can apply to both customers and products, Sales Tax 
items apply only to customers, which makes sense, since sales tax rates usually 
depend on the customer’s location. If the customer is in the boonies, you might 
assign the state Sales Tax item because the customer pays only that one tax. But a 
customer smack in the middle of downtown might have to pay state tax, city tax, 
and a special district tax. Once you assign Sales Tax items to customers (page 72), 
QuickBooks automatically fills in the Sales Tax item on your invoices and other sales 
forms to calculate the sales taxes incurred.

• Sales Tax Name. Type in a name for the tax. You can use the same identifiers that 
the tax authority does, or a more meaningful name like Colorado Sales Tax. You 
can fit up to 31 characters in this field—more than enough to include the four- or

A Sales Tax Group item calculates the total tax for multiple 
Sales Tax items—perfect when you sell goods in an area rife 
with state, county, city, and local sales taxes. The customer 
sees only the total tax, but QuickBooks tracks how much you 
owe to each agency. This type of item works the same way as 
a Group item (page 114), except that you add Sales Tax items 
to it instead of Service, Inventory, and Other Charge items.
As shown in Figure 21-3, a Sales Tax Group item applies several 
Sales Tax items at once. QuickBooks combines the individual 
tax rates into a total rate for the group, which is what the 
customer sees on the invoice. For example, businesses in 
Denver charge a combined sales tax of 7.62 percent, which is 
made up of a Denver sales tax, the Colorado sales tax, an RTD 
tax, and special district taxes.

Before you can create a 
Sales Tax Group item, you 
first need to create each 
of the Sales Tax items that 
you plan to include in it. 
Next, create a Sales Tax 
Group item, type the name 
or number of the group 
and a description, click 
the Tax Item cell, and then 
click the drop-down list 
to choose one of the Sales 
Tax items to include in the 
group. QuickBooks fills in 
the rate, tax agency, and 
description from the Sales 
Tax item.
Producing Reports of the Sales Tax You 
Owe
Tax agencies are renowned for their forms. You have to fill out forms to tell the agen­
cies how much sales tax you’ve collected and how much you’re required to remit 
to them. Fortunately, QuickBooks can take some of the sting out of tax paperwork 
with reports that collate the sales tax info you need to fill out your sales tax return.
Here are the reports you can generate (they’re listed under Reports→Vendors & 
Payables, or you can run them from the Manage Sales Tax window [Vendors→Sales 
Tax→Manage Sales Tax]):
• Sales Tax Liability. This report summarizes the sales taxes you’ve collected for 
each tax agency and breaks sales down into non-taxable and taxable. As shown 
in Figure 21-4, QuickBooks automatically sets the report’s dates to match the 
payment interval you chose when you set your sales tax preferences (page 547).
• Sales Tax Revenue Summary. This report shows the dollar values of taxable 
and non-taxable sales, which is also shown in the Sales Tax Liability report.

If you remit sales taxes 
to several tax agencies, 
each with its own payment

this report with a different 
interval to calculate the 
sales tax you owe to other 
agencies. Simply head to 
the Dates drop-down list 
and choose another inter-
val, such as Last Calendar 
Quarter, and then click 
Refresh.
Paying Sales Tax
You don’t pay sales taxes using QuickBooks’ Enter Bills or Write Checks windows. 
Instead, you use the program’s aptly named Pay Sales Tax feature. Here’s how you 
keep the tax agencies off your back:
1.	 Choose Vendors→Sales Tax→Pay Sales Tax, or, in the Manage Sales Tax 
window (Vendors→Sales Tax→Manage Sales Tax), click Pay Sales Tax.
Either way, QuickBooks opens the Pay Sales Tax dialog box and fills in the 
amounts you owe for the last collection period (as defined in your Sales Tax 
preferences [page 548]), as shown in Figure 21-5.
 NOTE 	 In some states, you may need to adjust the payments you make to a tax agency; for example, to 
apply a discount for timely payment, to round sales tax to the nearest dollar, or to include interest and penalties 
with your payment. In cases like that, click the Adjust button to open the Sales Tax Adjustment dialog box. You 
can increase or decrease the tax by a dollar value, and you have to specify the account to which you want to post 
the adjustment (the Sales Tax Payable account, say). If the Entry No. box seems vaguely familiar, that’s because 
this dialog box actually creates a journal entry (page 426) for the adjustment.
2.	 If you use more than one checking account, in the Pay From Account drop-
down list, choose the account you want to use.
QuickBooks automatically selects an account here if you set the “Open the Pay 
Sales Tax form with _ account” preference (page 640).

If you remit sales taxes to

But if you make payments 
to different agencies on 
different schedules, select 
all the agencies on the same

these steps for agencies that 
are on a different timetable.
 NOTE 	 Make sure the date in the “Show sales tax due through” box is the last day of the current sales tax 
reporting period. For example, if you pay sales taxes quarterly, choose a date like 3/31/2015.
3.	 In the Pay column, click cells to select the payments you want to make.
QuickBooks adds a checkmark to indicate that a payment is selected and puts 
the amount of the remittance in the Amt. Paid cell.
4.	 If you want to print the sales tax remittance checks from QuickBooks, make 
sure the “To be printed” checkbox is turned on, and then click OK.
With this checkbox turned on, you’ll see the remittance checks the next time 
you choose File→Print Forms→Checks. 
If you write checks by hand, turn off the “To be printed” checkbox, click OK, and 
then whip out your checkbook and write those remittance checks.

CHAPTER

A
s you’ve no doubt noticed in business and in life, the activities that cost 
money almost always seem to outnumber those that bring money in. Most 
companies want to make money and most nonprofits want to do the most 
with the funds they have, so budgeting and planning are essential business activities.
Like any kind of plan, a budget is an estimate of what’s going to happen. Your actual 
results will never exactly match the numbers you estimate in your budget. (If they do, 
someone’s playing games with your books.) But comparing your actual performance 
to your budget can tell you that it’s time to crack the whip on the sales team, rein 
in your spending, or both.
Budgeting in QuickBooks is both simple and simplistic. The program handles basic 
budgets and provides some shortcuts for entering numbers. However, you can’t 
see whether your budget is working as you build it, and playing what-if games with 
budgets requires some fancy footwork. (The box on page 559 describes one way 
to create multiple budgets for the same time period.)
The easiest way to handle budgets is to craft them with a spreadsheet program 
like Excel. You can use all of Excel’s commands to massage the numbers and then 
import your budgetary masterpiece into QuickBooks so you can compare your 
actual performance with the budget. This chapter explains your budgeting options, 
teaches you how to import budgets from other programs, and provides an overview 
of QuickBooks’ budget reports.
 TIP 	 QuickBooks also includes a Cash Flow Projector (it lives on the Company→Planning & Budgeting 
submenu). This wizard provides a forecast of cash flow similar to what you can obtain by running a Cash Flow 
Forecast report (page 459), so it’s not covered in this book.

TYPES OF 
BUDGETS
Types of Budgets
To most people, the word “budget” means a profit and loss budget—one that esti­
mates what your income and expenses will be over a period of time. QuickBooks’ 
profit and loss budgets are based on the income and expense accounts in your chart 
of accounts (see Chapter 3) and typically span your company’s fiscal year.
Balance sheet budgets aren’t as common, but you can create them in QuickBooks as 
well. Balance sheets are snapshots of your assets and liabilities, and balance sheet 
budgets follow the same format by showing the ending balances for your asset, 
liability, and other balance sheet accounts.
 NOTE 	 Most companies plan for major purchases and their accompanying loans outside of the budgeting 
process. For example, if a company needs an asset to operate, executives usually analyze costs, benefits, payback 
periods, internal rates of return, and so on before making purchasing decisions. They evaluate cash flow to decide 
whether to borrow money or use cash generated by operations. But after that, the additional income generated 
by the asset and the additional interest expense associated with any loans show up in the profit and loss budget.
QuickBooks’ profit and loss budgets come in three flavors, each helpful in its own way:
• Company profit and loss. The most common type of budget includes all the 
income and expenses for your entire company. This is the budget that man­
agement strives to follow—whether that’s to produce the net profit that keeps 
shareholders happy or to generate the cash needed to run the company. With 
QuickBooks’ Budget vs. Actual report (page 572), you can compare your actual 
results with your budget.
• Customer or job budget. A customer- or job-based profit and loss budget 
forecasts the income and expenses for a single customer or job. Projects that 
come with a lot of risk have to offer the potential for lots of profit to be worth­
while. By generating a profit and loss budget for a customer or job, you can 
make sure that the profitability meets your objectives.
• Class budget. If you use classes to track income and expenses, you can create 
profit and loss budgets for each class. Class budgets work particularly well when 
you track income and expenses for independent sections of your company: 
regions, business units, branches, partners, and so on.
Ways to Build Budgets
If you’ve just started a business, you may have a business plan that includes esti­
mates of your income and expenses. Or you may have run your business for a while 
without a budget and now want to create a budget using past performance as a 
starting point. Either way, there’s a method for building a budget in QuickBooks. 
But the easiest approach is to build your budget outside QuickBooks and import 
the results. Here are your options and what each has to offer:

Chapter 22: Budgeting and Planning
559

BUDGETS IN 
QUICKBOOKS
GEM IN THE ROUGH
Budgets vs. Forecasts
If you have QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, you’ll see the 
Set Up Forecast entry on the Company→Planning & Budgeting 
submenu. (QuickBooks Pro doesn’t include forecasts, so if you 
use that edition, you have to stick with budgets.) The window 
that opens when you choose Set Up Forecast is strikingly similar 
to the Set Up Budgets window (page 560). In fact, other than re-
placing the word “Budgets” with “Forecast,” they’re identical. 
So how do you decide whether to use a budget or a forecast?
In QuickBooks, you can have only one budget for a given period 
loaded at a time—for example, a 2015 profit and loss budget. 
A forecast lets you create another set of planning numbers 
for the same timeframe. So you can create a profit and loss 
budget for 2015 and a separate forecast for the same fiscal 
year, using the budget to reflect your most likely results and 
the forecast to show the numbers under more optimistic (or 
pessimistic) conditions.
QuickBooks has reports that compare your actual performance 
with budgets and forecasts (Reports→Budgets & Forecasts), 
so you can use either feature to compare your estimated 
numbers with your actual performance.
The bottom line: Use budgets unless you want a second set 
of planning numbers readily available. If you decide to create 
forecasts instead of—or in addition to—budgets, the instruc-
tions in this chapter apply to them, too.
• From previous year’s actual results. If this is your first budget and you have 
at least several months’ worth of data in QuickBooks, you can use that existing 
data as a starting point (page 561) and edit only the values that change.
• From scratch. This method can be tedious because you have to estimate and 
fill in all the budget numbers (although, as you’ll learn on page 564, QuickBooks 
does offer some data-entry shortcuts). Fortunately, you only have to use this 
approach for your first budget. The next section explains how.
• From data in another program. The best way to build a budget is to create 
it in a program like Excel and then import it into QuickBooks. Setting up a 
spreadsheet for your company budget in Excel or some other program offers 
several advantages. After you set up the Excel file with rows for each account 
and columns for months and other fields, you can save it as a template for 
creating future budgets. If you’re an Excel wizard, you can use that program’s 
tools to quickly create and fine-tune your budget. You also can copy that file 
to create what-if scenarios or next year’s budget based on the previous year’s 
budget. You can read about building a budget with Excel starting on page 568.
Creating Budgets in QuickBooks
The Set Up Budgets wizard is the place to go for profit and loss budgets; balance 
sheet budgets; budgets for customers, jobs, and classes; and budgets built from 
scratch or from previous years’ data.
Before you dive into building a budget, you have to perform two setup steps if you 
want your budgets to work properly:

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
560
CREATING 
BUDGETS IN 
QUICKBOOKS
• Fiscal year. QuickBooks uses the first month of your fiscal year as the first 
month of the budget. To check that you defined your fiscal year correctly, 
choose Company→My Company or, in the left icon bar, click My Company. In 
the window that appears, at the top right of the Company Information section, 
click the Edit button (its icon looks like a pencil). Then, on the left side of the 
Company Information dialog box, click Report Information and make sure that 
the month in the Fiscal Year box is correct.
• Active accounts. QuickBooks budgets cover only the accounts that are active 
in your chart of accounts. To activate any accounts you want to budget, press 
Ctrl+A to open the Chart of Accounts window, and then turn on the “Include 
inactive” checkbox. (If no accounts are inactive, this checkbox is grayed out.) 
For any inactive account that you want in your budget, click the X to the left of 
the account’s name to reactivate it.
To start the budget wizard, choose Company→Planning & Budgeting→Set Up Bud­
gets. Depending on whether you already have a budget in QuickBooks, the program 
displays one of two different wizards. The Create New Budget wizard (Figure 22-1) 
appears if this is your first budget in this company file. If you already have at least 
one budget in your company file, QuickBooks opens the Set Up Budgets wizard 
instead and displays your most recent budget. To create a new budget in that wiz­
ard, click the Create New Budget button to launch the wizard shown in Figure 22-1.
FIGURE 22-1
In the Create New Budget 
wizard, you first tell 
QuickBooks about the year 
and type of budget you 
want to create. 
On the second screen (not 
shown), you can specify 
whether the budget works 
with customers, jobs, or 
classes. (You’ll see the 
option for creating class 
budgets only if you’ve 
turned on QuickBooks’ 
class feature [page 636].)
The steps for setting up a new budget are the same whether QuickBooks automati­
cally displays the Create New Budget wizard or you click the Create New Budget 
button in the Set Up Budgets wizard:
1.	 On the Create a New Budget screen (Figure 22-1), choose a fiscal year and 
budget type, and then click Next.

Chapter 22: Budgeting and Planning
561
CREATING 
BUDGETS IN 
QUICKBOOKS
QuickBooks automatically fills in the next calendar year (perhaps assuming that 
you’re done budgeting for the current year). Click the up and down arrows to 
the box’s right to choose the fiscal year you’re budgeting for.
Below the year setting, the program automatically selects the “Profit and Loss 
(reflects all activity for the year)” option because most budgets cover income 
and expenses for a year. If you choose this option, continue with the rest of the 
steps in this list. 
If you want to create a balance sheet budget instead, select the “Balance Sheet 
(reflects ending balance)” option. If you go this route, you don’t have to set any 
additional criteria before you build the budget for your balance sheet accounts, 
so you don’t need to perform the rest of the steps in this list. Simply click Next 
in the Create New Budget wizard, and QuickBooks displays a screen that tells 
you to click Finish. When you do, a table containing your balance sheet accounts 
appears in the Set Up Budgets window, and you can begin typing ending bal­
ances, as explained in the “Filling in Budget Values” section on page 564.
2.	 On the Additional Profit and Loss Budget Criteria screen, select the flavor 
of profit and loss budget you want, and then click Next.
QuickBooks automatically selects the “No additional criteria” option, which 
creates the most common type of budget: a profit and loss budget for the 
entire company. (The next section explains how to create Customer:Job and 
Class budgets.)
3.	 On the “Choose how you want to create a budget” screen, tell QuickBooks 
how you want to fill in the initial budget data.
Keep the “Create budget from scratch” option selected if you want to create a 
blank budget. If you go this route, jump to page 564 to learn how to enter data 
in the Set Up Budgets wizard.
If you have actual data that you want to use as a foundation for your budget, 
select “Create budget from previous year’s actual data” instead. This option 
transfers the monthly income and expense account totals from the previous 
year into the budget.
4.	 Click Finish.
QuickBooks opens the Set Up Budgets window, which includes a monstrous 
table. The rows represent each active account in your chart of accounts; each 
column is one month of the fiscal year.
If you opted to create a budget for a customer, job, or class, the window 
includes either the Current Customer:Job drop-down list containing all your 
active customers and jobs (Figure 22-2) or the Class drop-down list containing 
all your active classes. Before you start entering values for a customer, job, or 
class budget, choose the customer, job, or class from this list.
The section on page 564 explains how to fill in the cells in this table.

 NOTE 	 If your monitor’s resolution is less than 1024 × 768, the Set Up Budgets window also includes the 
Show Next 6 Months button, because your screen can’t display the entire year. In that case, QuickBooks initially 
displays January through June. Click Show Next 6 Months to display July through December (the button’s label 
changes to Show Prev 6 Months).
Creating Customer:Job or Class Budgets
In QuickBooks, there’s no way to store several versions of a fiscal-year budget that 
covers your entire operation. But you can create additional budgets for the same 
fiscal year for different customers and jobs, or for classes.
 NOTE 	 Class budgets work the way Customer:Job budgets do. In fact, if you replace every instance of 
“Customer:Job” in the following tutorial with “Class,” you’ll have the instructions for creating Class budgets.
Here’s how to work with Customer:Job or Class budgets:
1.	 Choose Company→Planning & Budgeting→Set Up Budgets as you would 
for a regular budget. At the Set Up Budgets window’s top right, click the 
Create New Budget button.
The Create New Budget window opens. QuickBooks automatically fills in the next 
calendar year and selects the “Profit and Loss” option. If you want to create a 
budget for a different year or of a different type, choose the year and/or type.
2.	 When the year and budget type are what you want, click Next.
The “Additional Project and Loss Budget Criteria” screen appears.
3.	 On this screen, select the Customer:Job option or Class option to create a 
Customer:Job or class budget, respectively, and then click Next.
You see the Class option only if you’ve turned on class tracking (page 636). The 
rest of this tutorial assumes you’re creating a Customer:Job budget, but these 
instructions work for Class budgets, too.
4.	 On the “Choose how you want to create a budget” screen, choose the ap­
propriate option, and then click Finish.
QuickBooks adds the Current Customer:Job box to the Set Up Budgets window 
between the Budget list and the table.
5.	 In the Current Customer:Job drop-down list, choose the customer or job 
that you want to budget, as shown in Figure 22-2.
Any budgetary numbers you’ve previously entered for the customer or job for 
the selected fiscal year appear in the budget table.

The Current Customer:Job 
drop-down list displays 
both customers and jobs 
so you can create budgets 
for customers or specific 
jobs. (Jobs are indented 
beneath their correspond-
ing customers.)
6.	 In the budget table, fill in values for the Customer:Job budget (see page 
564 to learn how).
Unlike a budget for your entire operation, Customer:Job budgets may have 
values for only a few accounts. For example, for a job that includes products, 
services, and reimbursable expenses, your budget may have values only for 
income accounts and the expense accounts for reimbursable expenses.
7.	 When you’re finished entering values, click Save.
If you choose another customer or job without clicking Save, QuickBooks asks if 
you want to record the budget. In the Recording Budget message box, click Yes.
8.	 If you want to create a budget for another customer, job, or class, in the Set 
Up Budgets window’s Budget drop-down list, choose the fiscal year that 
you want to budget.
For Customer:Job budgets, the Budget drop-down list includes an entry like 
“FY2016 - Profit & Loss by Account and Customer:Job.” (Class budgets show 
up in the Budget drop-down list looking something like “FY2016 - Profit & Loss 
by Account and Class.”)

After you’ve created specialized budgets like these, you can revisit any of them 
by selecting a budget like “FY2016 - Profit & Loss by Account and Customer:Job” 
in the Budget drop-down list, and then selecting the customer or job in the 
Current Customer:Job drop-down list. (For class budgets, choose a budget like 
“FY2016 - Profit & Loss by Account and Class” in the Budget drop-down list, 
and then choose the class in the Current Class drop-down list.)
Filling in Budget Values
Regardless of which type of budget you create, you use the same method to fill in 
and edit values in QuickBooks. To add budget values to an account, in the Set Up 
Budgets window’s Account column, click the account. When you do, QuickBooks 
automatically selects the cell in that row’s first month column. If you’re filling in 
the entire year’s worth of numbers, type the value for the first month, press Tab to 
move to the next month, and continue until you’ve entered values for all 12 months. 
The Annual Total column displays the total for all months, as shown in Figure 22-3.
FIGURE 22-3
To copy the value in a cell 
into the remaining cells in 
that row, start by selecting

Filling in a few budget cells is usually enough to convince you that data entry short­
cuts are in order. Luckily, QuickBooks gives you two ways to enter values faster, 
both described next. And the box below explains what some of the buttons at the 
bottom of the Set Up Budgets window do.
UP TO SPEED
Managing Budgets
In the Set Up Budgets window, several buttons help you man-
age the budgeting work you do in QuickBooks. Although you’re 
probably familiar with their functions based on similar buttons 
in other windows, here’s a quick overview:
• Clear. Click this button at the window’s bottom left to 
delete all the values in a budget—for every account and 
every month. This is the button to click if you want to start 
over. (If you click this button by accident, don’t worry: 
QuickBooks displays a confirmation box where you can 
click No to preserve the numbers you’ve entered.)
• Save. When you’ve added or updated all the values in a 
budget, click this button near the window’s bottom right 
to save your work. You can also click Save so you don’t 
lose the work you’ve done so far. And even if you forget 
to click this button, if you click OK or choose another 
budget, QuickBooks asks whether you want to record the 
one you’ve been working on, giving you a chance to save.
• OK. Clicking this button saves the values you’ve entered 
and closes the Set Up Budgets window.
• Cancel. Clicking this button closes the window without 
saving your work.
Copying Across Columns
Because budgets are estimates, you don’t need extraordinarily detailed or precise 
values. In the Set Up Budgets window, you can copy a number from one cell in a row 
to all the cells to its right in the same row, as demonstrated in Figure 22-3.
 TIP 	 If the account names and budget values are hopelessly truncated and you have screen real estate to 
spare, enlarge the Set Up Budgets window by dragging a corner or maximizing it. The columns show more of 
the cell contents as you enlarge the window. To resize a specific column to make it wider or narrower, put your 
cursor over the three vertical dots to the right of the column’s header. When the cursor turns into a two-headed 
arrow, drag right or left.
This shortcut is fabulous when a monthly expense remains the same throughout 
the year, like office rent, for example. But it also works if a price changes midyear. 
For instance, suppose the corporate concierge you’ve hired to run errands for your 
employees announces that his rates are going up in May. If your budget contains 
the old rate in every month, click the cell for May and type the new rate. Then click 
Copy Across, and QuickBooks lists the new rate for May through December.
 TIP 	 If you mistakenly add values to cells that should be blank, Copy Across is the fastest way to empty a 
row. Clear the first month’s cell by selecting its value and then pressing Backspace. Then click Copy Across to have 
QuickBooks clear all the other cells in that row.

Adjust Row Amounts
The Set Up Budgets window’s Adjust Row Amounts button lets you increase or 
decrease monthly values by a specific dollar amount or percentage. Say you created 
a budget from the previous year’s data, but you want to increase all the values in 
the current year by 10 percent. Or maybe your company is growing quickly and you 
want to apply some heat to your sales force by increasing the target income each 
month. In that case, you can tell QuickBooks to compound the increase, so each 
month’s sales target is a little higher than the previous month’s value.
Changing all the cells in a row by a fixed dollar amount isn’t as useful as you might 
think, because Copy Across basically does the same thing in most cases. But when 
you change budget amounts by percentages or compound increases each month, 
the Adjust Row Amounts feature takes care of the calculations for you. Here’s how 
to adjust row amounts in both of these ways:
1.	 Click the row you want to adjust.
If you want to start the adjustment in a specific month, click the cell for the 
starting month.
2.	 Click the Adjust Row Amounts button.
QuickBooks opens the Adjust Row Amounts dialog box and, in the “Start at” 
box, automatically selects the option that you chose the last time you opened 
this dialog box. “1st month” starts adjustments in the first month of the fiscal 
year. To start with the month you selected instead, choose “Currently selected 
month” (if you select this option, QuickBooks displays the “Enable compound­
ing” checkbox, which is explained in step 5).
 NOTE 	 The Adjust Row Amounts feature is for adjusting existing budget values, not for filling in blank cells. 
For example, if you select the “Increase each remaining monthly amount in this row by this dollar amount or 
percentage” option and then type 100 in the text box, QuickBooks adds 100 to the values in the month cells. So 
if the January cell is set to 1,000, it increases to 1,100. However, if the remaining months’ cells are zero (0), they 
increase only to 100.
3.	 Select the appropriate option for how the prices change.
QuickBooks automatically selects the “Increase each remaining monthly amount 
in this row by this dollar amount or percentage” option because prices usually 
go up. But if prices are decreasing, select the option that begins with “Decrease 
each remaining monthly amount” instead.
4.	 In the text box for the option you selected, type the dollar amount or per­
centage, and then click OK.
For example, if the landlord tells you that rent is going up 5 percent, in the box 
for the Increase option, type 5%, and QuickBooks increases the value in all the 
remaining cells by 5 percent. So if your rent was $5,000 a month, the values in 
all the remaining months change to $5,250.

Chapter 22: Budgeting and Planning
567
FILLING IN 
BUDGET 
VALUES
To add a dollar amount to the remaining cells instead, type that dollar value. 
For example, to add $250 a month to the Rent cells, in the box for this option, 
type 250. Each subsequent cell in the Rent row increases by 250. (Of course, 
you can do the same thing by typing the new rent amount in the cell for the 
first month to which it applies and then clicking Copy Across.)
5.	 If you chose “Currently selected month” in the “Start at” box in step 2, the 
“Enable compounding” checkbox appeared; turn it on if you want to adjust 
each month’s value based on the previous month’s value.
When you compound dollar amounts, QuickBooks adds the dollar amount you 
specify to the next month’s value. For example, if January’s value is 5,000 and 
you change the value by 100, February’s value becomes 5,100, March’s value 
increases by another 100 to 5,200, and so on, as shown in Figure 22-4.
You can also compound by percentage. If you turn on the “Enable compounding” 
checkbox and then type a percentage in the text box, QuickBooks increases the 
next month’s value by the percentage you specify. If January’s value is 5,000 
and you increase it by 1 percent, for example, then February’s value becomes 
5,050, March’s value increases another 1 percent to 5,100.50, and so on.
FIGURE 22-4
When you compound val-
ues, QuickBooks increases 
the previous month’s 
value by the amount you 
specify, as shown here. 
If January’s value is 5,000 
and you increase it by 
$100, February’s value 
is 5,100, March’s value 
increases another $100 to 
5,200, and so on.

BUDGETS WITH 
EXCEL
Creating and Copying Budgets with Excel
QuickBooks’ budget reports can help you plan for the future and evaluate whether 
your business is going boom or bust. However, the program’s tools for building 
and editing budgets don’t compare to what you can do with a program like Excel.
QuickBooks keeps only one budget at a time for the same type of budget and time 
period—for example, the profit and loss budget for fiscal year 2016—and it doesn’t 
offer a feature for copying a budget. That’s where a spreadsheet program comes 
in handy. You can easily copy a budget spreadsheet, make the changes you want, 
and then import the final product into QuickBooks. For example, you might create 
next year’s budget from this year’s. Or you might experiment with what-if scenarios 
including a bare-bones budget in case a client with shaky finances disappears and 
a second happy-dance budget if you snag that big new project.
There are two parts to working on budgets with Excel:
1.	 Setting up a budget in an Excel spreadsheet so you can import it into 
QuickBooks.
2.	 Importing the final budget into your company file.
The following sections describe each step in detail.
Setting Up a Budget in Excel
To import budgets into QuickBooks, you need to create an IIF file, a QuickBooks 
text file with keywords that tell the program where to put data in your company file. 
Happily, you can build your budget in Excel and then save that spreadsheet as a text 
file. To make importing a budget a little easier, you can download an Excel budget 
spreadsheet named ch22_budget_import.xlsx from this book’s Missing CD at www.
missingmanuals/cds. Read on to learn how to use this spreadsheet. 
Here’s what the keywords in ch22_budget_import.xlsx represent:
• !BUD. This is a special keyword for the row that contains the other budget key­
words in columns. Basically, this keyword means, “Hey QuickBooks! This is the 
row you need to look in to find out which fields the values in this budget go in!”
• ACCNT. In the cells below this keyword, fill in the accounts you’re budgeting. 
Make sure that the account names you enter here match the account names in 
your company file.
• PERIOD. Keep the cells in this column set to “Month” to import a monthly budget.
• AMOUNT. This keyword identifies the columns that contain your budget values. 
For a monthly, yearlong budget, you need 12 columns with this keyword.
• STARTDATE. In the column that contains this keyword, fill in your budget’s start 
date in each row that contains budget values.

569
CREATING 
AND COPYING 
BUDGETS WITH 
EXCEL
• CLASS. If you’re creating a class budget, fill in the cells below this keyword with 
the appropriate class.
• CUSTOMER. If you’re creating a Customer:Job budget, fill in this column with 
the appropriate customer.
• BUD. This keyword goes in the first column’s cells below the one that contains 
the !BUD keyword. Enter BUD in the first cell in every row that contains an ac­
count and budget values.
FIGURE 22-5
QuickBooks uses keywords 
to interpret the data in 
your IIF file. The keyword 
!BUD indicates that the 
data is for a budget. Other 
keywords tell the program 
how to map the data to 
QuickBooks fields. The 
keyword BUD in the first 
cell in a row tells the pro-
gram that the row contains 
budget values. 
After you fill in your budget in Excel, here’s how you save it to a format QuickBooks 
can read:
1.	 In Excel, choose File→Save As. In the Save As dialog box’s “Save as type” 
drop-down list, choose “Text (Tab delimited) (*.txt).”
Doing so tells Excel to save the spreadsheet as a text file.
2.	 In the “File name” box, type a filename such as full_budget_2016.iif, and 
then click Save.
The .iff part is important, so be sure to include it. Excel warns that you might 
lose features by saving a text file. Click Yes to continue. Excel saves the file with 
the filename full_budget_2016.iif.txt (or whatever you named it). Don’t worry 
that the file has two suffixes (called file extensions) on it—you’ll fix that in a sec.
3.	 Close the file in Excel.

570

BUDGET 
REPORTS
4.	 In Windows Explorer, open the folder where you saved the text file. Right-
click the file and choose Rename on the shortcut menu. Remove the text 
“.txt” at the end of the filename, and then press Enter to save it.
You’ll see a warning that the file might become unusable if you change its file 
name extension. Click Yes.
Now you’re ready to import the file into QuickBooks.
Importing a Budget into QuickBooks
After you create or edit your budget in Excel, importing it into QuickBooks is easy:
1.	 To import the IIF file you created in the previous section into QuickBooks, 
choose File→Utilities→Import→IIF Files.
QuickBooks opens the Import dialog box and automatically sets the “Files of 
type” box to “IIF Files (*.IIF).” If you don’t see your file, in the “Files of type” 
box, choose “All Files (*.*)” instead.
2.	 Double-click the name of the IIF file that contains your edited budget.
When a QuickBooks Information box appears telling you that the import was 
successful, click OK to dismiss it.
3.	 Choose Company→Planning & Budgeting→Set Up Budgets.
If you created a budget for a new fiscal year, in the Set Up Budgets window, the 
Budget drop-down list now contains an entry for that year’s budget.
If you used a spreadsheet to edit an existing budget, in the Budget drop-down 
list, choose the entry for that budget to see the updated values in the budget 
table.
 NOTE 	 If you’re experimenting with several budgets for the same time period, you can import one and then 
run budget reports to examine it more closely. Just remember to finish by importing the budget you decide to 
use.
Running Budget Reports
A budget gives you a target to aim for. The Set Up Budgets window lets you type 
values for income and expense accounts, but it doesn’t show you whether your 
budget results in a net profit or loss. For that, you need a budget report (or your 
budget set up in a spreadsheet program, as described on page 568). And to compare 
your business performance with your budget, you need a budget report that shows 
budget and actual numbers side by side. 
QuickBooks provides four types of budget reports: one to review budgets you’ve cre­
ated and three to compare your performance with your plan. This section describes 
the various reports, what they’re useful for, and how to create and format them.

 NOTE 	 To learn about all the options for customizing any QuickBooks report, see Chapter 23. And page 601 
explains how to memorize a customized report.
The Budget Overview Report
The Set Up Budgets window shows your accounts and the values you enter for 
each month, but it doesn’t tell you whether your budget produces a profit or loss. 
The Budget Overview report shows budget numbers for each account and month, 
too, but it also subtotals values if you use top-level accounts and subaccounts in 
your chart of accounts, as shown in Figure 22-6. To see whether you earn enough 
income to cover expenses, look at the net income value (income minus expenses) 
at the bottom of the report for each month and for the entire year.
FIGURE 22-6
Although you build 
budgets month by 
month, many businesses 
(particularly ones with 
shareholders) focus on 
quarterly performance. 
To view your budget 
by quarter instead of 
by month, in the Show 
Columns drop-down list, 
choose Quarter.
To run this report, choose Reports→Budgets→Budget Overview (or, if you have 
QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise, Reports→Budgets & Forecasts→Budget Over­
view). In the Budget Report dialog box, first choose the budget you want to view, 
and then pick a layout (explained in a moment). When you click Finish, QuickBooks 
opens the Budget Overview report window. (Depending on the report settings 
you’ve chosen [page 659], the Modify Report dialog box might appear; if you see 
that dialog box, simply click Cancel to close it.)
 NOTE 	 The Budget Overview report includes only accounts that have budget values.

BUDGET 
REPORTS
REPORT LAYOUTS
If you create a report for a profit and loss budget for your entire company, the only 
layout option in the Budget Report dialog box is Account By Month, in which the 
first column lists the accounts and each subsequent column shows one month of 
the fiscal year. You can change the columns to different durations in the Profit & 
Loss Budget Overview window (Figure 22-6).
On the other hand, if you choose a Customer:Job budget in the Budget Report dialog 
box and then click Next, the Budget Report dialog box includes these layout options:
• Account By Month lists accounts in the first column and months of the fiscal 
year in the subsequent columns. The values in the monthly columns represent 
the totals for all the Customer:Job budgets you’ve created.
• Account By Customer:Job lists accounts in the first column and includes ad­
ditional columns for each customer or job you’ve budgeted. Each customer and 
job column shows its annual totals.
• Customer:Job by Month adds a row for each customer and additional rows 
for each job that customer has. The columns are for each month of the fiscal 
year. The value for a job and month represents the total budgeted value for 
all accounts.
The Budget vs. Actual Report
This report (Reports→Budgets→Budget vs. Actual or, in QuickBooks Premier and 
Enterprise, Reports→Budgets & Forecasts→Budget vs. Actual) compares the budget 
you created with the actual income and expenses your business achieved. Run this 
report monthly for early warnings that your performance is veering off track. For 
example, if your income is short of your target, the “% of Budget” column shows 
percentages less than 100 percent; if you’re making more than you planned, this 
column shows percentages greater than 100 percent. On the other hand, expenses 
greater than 100 percent indicate that costs are ballooning beyond your budget.
This report includes four columns for each time period in the report: the first four 
columns show the actual value, budgeted value, and the dollar value and percent­
age difference between the first two values for the first time period. The next four 
columns include data related to the second time period, and so on. The column 
with the heading for a month and year (like “Jan 15” or, for a quarter, “Jan-Mar 15”) 
is your actual performance. The Budget column includes the budgeted values for 
the same time period. You can also see the difference between the two values for 
that time period in dollars (in the Over Budget column) and as a percentage (in the 
“% of Budget” column).

 TIP 	 If the numbers in your report don’t seem right, the culprit could be the wrong choice of accrual or cash 
reporting (page xxii explains the difference). In the report window, click Customize Report and then, on the 
Display tab, click the Accrual or Cash option to match your reporting style. Page 661 explains how to change the 
reporting preference for accrual or cash reporting.
The Profit & Loss Budget Performance Report
This report (Reports→Budgets→Profit & Loss Budget Performance or, in QuickBooks 
Premier and Enterprise,  Reports→Budgets & Forecasts→Profit & Loss Budget Per­
formance) also compares budgeted and actual values but initially shows the actual 
values for the current month so far with the budgeted values for the entire month in 
the Budget column. Two additional columns show the actual and budgeted values 
for the year to date. The rightmost column shows the budget for the entire year.
Use this report to check your performance before the end of each month. Because 
the budget numbers represent the entire month, you shouldn’t expect a perfect 
match between actual and budgeted values. But if your income or expenses are 
way off the mark, you can take corrective action.
The Budget vs. Actual Graph
To see a graph comparing your budget to actual performance, choose Reports→ 
Budgets→Budget vs. Actual Graph (or, in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise, 
Reports→Budgets & Forecasts→Budget vs. Actual Graph). This graph displays the 
differences between your budgeted and actual values in two ways:
• The upper bar graph shows the difference between your actual and budgeted 
net income for each month. When your actual net income exceeds the budgeted 
value (meaning you made more money than you planned), the bar is blue and 
appears above the horizontal axis. If the actual net income is less than budgeted, 
the bar is red and drops below the horizontal axis.
• The lower bar graph sorts accounts, customers, or classes (depending on the 
report you choose by clicking “P&L by Accounts,” “P&L by Accounts and Jobs,” 
or “P&L by Accounts and Classes” in the report window’s button bar) that are 
the furthest from your budgeted values (either above or below). For example, 
if you click “P&L by Accounts and Jobs,” the bars show the customers and jobs 
that exceeded your budget by the largest amount or fell the furthest short.
If the report window can’t display all the bars at the same time, then in the window’s 
button bar, click Next Group to display the bars for the next several accounts.

Memorizing Budget Reports
When you generate budget reports, it takes several clicks to 
specify the budget and layout you want to see. In addition, after 
the report window opens, you might click Customize Report to 
change the date range, the columns that appear, and so on. All 
in all, getting the budget report you really want might require 
a dozen or more small customizations.
Rather than reapply all these tweaks each time you gener-
ate the report, memorize the customized report so you can 
regenerate it with just one click. Here’s how:
1.	 In the report window’s button bar, click Memorize. 
QuickBooks opens the Memorize Report dialog box.
2.	 In the Name box, type a name for the customized report, 
such as P&L Budget vs. Actual 2015.
3.	 If you want to save the report in a special group, turn on 
the Save in Memorized Report Group checkbox and then, 
in the drop-down list, choose the group. For example, you 
might store budget reports in the Company group. (If you 
don’t save the report to a special group, QuickBooks adds 
it to the Memorized Report submenu, described in a sec.)
4.	 Click OK.
To run the report, choose Reports→Memorized Reports. If you 
didn’t save the report to a group, choose the report’s name on 
the Memorized Reports submenu. If you did save it to a group, 
in the Memorized Reports submenu, choose the group and then 
the report’s name.

CHAPTER
23
Q
uickBooks comes with loads of built-in reports that show what’s going on 
with your company’s finances. But having a dozen report categories with 
several reports tucked into each one presents a few challenges, particularly 
if you’re new to both business and QuickBooks.
The first challenge is knowing what type of report tells you what you need to know. 
For example, a profit and loss (P&L) report shows how much income and expense 
you had over a given time period, but a balance sheet tells you how much your 
company is worth.
The second challenge is finding the report you want within the different report 
categories. After deciding you want to compare the profit of the items you sell, for 
example, do you look for the corresponding QuickBooks report in the Customers & 
Receivables category; Sales category; Inventory category; or Jobs, Time & Mileage 
category? (If you guessed Jobs, Time & Mileage, you’re right.)
The Report Center is a handy way to find the reports you want. But flipping through 
this book can be even faster, which is why each chapter describes the built-in reports 
that correspond to the bookkeeping tasks the chapter covers, what they’re good 
for, and where you can find them.
A third challenge—for even the most knowledgeable QuickBooks aficionado—is that 
the built-in reports might not do exactly what you want. A date range could be off, 
information that you don’t want might be included, or the data could be grouped in 
ways that don’t make sense for your business. After using QuickBooks for a while, 
most businesses tweak the program’s built-in reports. This chapter explains how to 
customize reports to get what you want. And there’s no point in letting that custom­
ization go to waste, so you’ll also learn how to memorize your customized reports,

add them to QuickBooks’ menus for fast access, and even exchange particularly 
handy customized reports between company files.
You’ll also learn about new report features in QuickBooks 2015. First, reports have 
gotten a new look that makes them much easier to read. In addition, you can now 
add comments to your reports. The following pages have the details.
Finding the Right Reports
If you know what kind of report answers your burning business question, finding 
that report can be as simple as dragging your mouse through the Reports menu 
to a likely category, and then, on the category’s submenu, clicking the name of the 
report you want. But if you need help figuring out what a report does and what it 
looks like, the Report Center could be your new best friend.
To open the Report Center, choose Reports→Report Center or, in the icon bar, click 
Reports. (Page 702 explains how to add this icon to the icon bar if it isn’t visible.) 
The window that appears includes a clickable list of the same categories and reports 
as in the Reports menu. But unlike the menu, the Report Center gives you all sorts 
of hints for finding the right report. It also offers several shortcuts for getting to the 
right report fast, as you can see in Figure 23-1.
On the left side of the Report Center, you’ll initially see built-in report categories. 
(The categories you see change depending on whether you select the Memorized, 
Favorites, Recent, or Contributed tab at the top of the window; the categories that 
these tabs represent are described on page 578.) To see the reports in a category, 
click the category’s name, like Company & Financial, Sales, or Banking.
Reviewing Reports in the Report Center
The Report Center gives you three ways to view the reports in a category:
• Grid View, shown in Figure 23-1, is ideal when you need a little help finding the 
right report. It displays previews of each type of report in the category selected 
on the left side of the window. To see more reports in that category, scroll 
down. Date-range info and report-related icons appear below each thumbnail. 
To display this view, in the Report Center’s upper right, click the Grid View icon.
• List View is your best bet when you want brief hints about the right reports 
and want to get to those reports quickly. In this view, you can select a category 
on the Report Center’s left, and the titles of that category’s reports and the 
questions they answer appear in a space-saving list. To use this view, click the 
List View icon labeled in Figure 23-1.

Each report’s thumbnail 
shows an example of the 
report’s contents and its 
saved date range (that is, 
the date range the report 
uses if you run it without 
changing any settings). 
Below the thumbnail are 
several icons.
The tabs at the top of the 
window make it easy to 
get to the reports you use 
most often: memorized 
reports (page 601), reports 
you designate as favorites 
(page 579), reports you’ve 
run recently, and reports 
you’ve obtained online 
(see the box on page 579).
• Carousel View displays a sample report (one that doesn’t use your company’s 
accounts or data) in the center of the window. In addition to the report’s title, 
the question that it answers appears above the sample, such as “What are my 
company’s total purchases from each vendor?” for the “Purchases by Vendor 
Summary” report. Below the report, you can change the date range by clicking 
the down arrow to the right of the current range and choosing a new one. To 
run the report, double-click its preview or click the Run icon (the white arrow 
inside a green circle).
Other reports in the current category wait in the wings to the left and right 
of the selected report. To access these reports, either click their preview im­
ages or use the slider bar at the bottom of the Report Center window to scroll 
through them until the one you’re looking for appears front and center. To use

(see Figure 23-1).
Working with Reports in the Report Center
For each report in the Report Center, its saved date range setting and icons for 
performing report-related tasks appear below the report preview. Here’s what you 
can do with each one:
• Date range. QuickBooks displays the name of the report’s saved date range 
and the dates the range represents; for example, This Fiscal Year and “1/1/2015 
– 12/31/2015.” To change the range before you run the report, click the range’s 
name (This Fiscal Year, for example), and then choose a new range from the 
drop-down list, such as Last Fiscal Year. (See page 591 to learn about the date 
ranges you can choose from.)
• Preview a report. For built-in reports, click the icon that looks like a magnifying 
glass in front of a piece of paper to see a sample of the report you’ve selected. 
(This icon isn’t included in Carousel View because the thumbnails act as report 
previews.) If you click the Report Center’s Memorized tab and then click a Pre­
view icon, the samples just say “Memorized Report” and “Sample”; you have 
to run the report to see what it looks like.
• Run a report. The Run icon is a white arrow in a green circle (the tooltip that 
appears when you point your cursor at it reads “Display Report.”) When you 
click this icon, QuickBooks runs the report and displays it in a report window. 
You can then click Customize Report in the report window’s toolbar to make 
changes (page 589).
 NOTE 	 The heart icon lets you designate your favorite reports. You’ll learn how to do that in the next section.
• Learn more. If you want to know more about a report and how you can custom­
ize it, click the “Learn more about this report” icon (the blue circle with a white 
question mark). QuickBooks opens the Help topic for that report, which gives 
hints about how to use and customize it. If you click this icon for a memorized re­
port, QuickBooks opens the “Work with memorized reports” Help topic instead.
Finding Frequently Used Reports
The Report Center initially displays QuickBooks’ built-in reports and the categories 
to which they belong. However, the center also offers quick access to reports that 
you run often:
• Memorized reports. If you modify reports to suit your needs, you can memorize 
them (page 601) and run them again and again with all your customized settings 
in place. In the Report Center, click the Memorized tab to see your memorized 
report groups (page 602). Select one to display the reports within it.

GEM IN THE ROUGH
Sharing Reports with Others
If you don’t see the kind of report you want, you may not have 
to customize a report yourself. The Report Center’s Contributed 
tab makes it easy to grab reports shared by Intuit and others 
within the online Intuit Community. When you click this tab, 
you can filter its list of shared reports by industry and sort it 
by category. In the View Industry drop-down list, click the 
industry you want, such as Professional Consulting. Click the 
Sort By box and choose “Most popular” or “Highly rated” to 
see the shared reports that others have found helpful. To see 
recently added reports, choose “Newly shared.”
To run a shared report, put your cursor over the one you’re 
interested in to display its icons. (If you’re in Carousel View, 
the icons will already be visible.) Then click its Run icon (the 
white arrow in a green circle).
If you like, you can rate these shared reports. One of the icons 
for shared reports is labeled “Rate.” When you click it, the “Add 
a comment and rate this report” dialog box opens. Comments 
from others appear in the lower half of the dialog box. Type 
your comments in the upper half and fill in the Name field 
with your name or nickname. Then click the number of stars 
you want to give the report; for example, to give it a five-star 
rating, click the rightmost star. When you’re done, click “Add 
and Close” to post your review and close the dialog box.
You can also return the favor by sharing your reports with the 
community. When you click the Report Center’s Memorized tab, 
each report has a Share icon that looks like two pieces of paper, 
as shown in Figure 23-2. Click this icon to open the Share Tem-
plate window. Fill in information about your report, including 
a title, description, your name, and your email address (in case 
Intuit has a question about the report), and then click Share.
FIGURE 23-2
To share a report, click the 
icon circled here.
In the Share Template 
dialog box (foreground), 
the “Share anonymously” 
option is selected auto-
matically, but you can 
select the “Share using 
your name” option if you 
want some publicity for 
your creations.
On the dialog box’s Addi-
tional Report Info tab, you 
can designate a category 
and choose the industries 
the report applies to.
• Favorite reports. QuickBooks lets you indicate your favorite reports so you can 
get to them in a jiffy. The Report Center’s Favorites tab displays all the reports

REPORTS
that you designate as favorites. Whenever you select a report in the Report 
Center, a Fave icon (an orange heart) appears (its tooltip says, “Mark as Favor­
ite”). If the report is one that you run more often than you check email, simply 
click this icon; QuickBooks adds the report to the Favorites tab and turns the 
report’s heart icon gray to indicate that this is one of your favorites.
• Recent reports. You can quickly rerun a report you’ve used lately by clicking 
the Recent tab, and then choosing the report you want. For example, if you 
produced a Sales by Customer report a few days ago and need to run it again, 
on the left side of the Recent tab, click the “Last 1-7 days” heading, click the 
report’s name, and then click the Display Report icon.
• Search. If you don’t know which built-in report you want, you can use keywords 
to narrow down your choices. For example, if you want to see how much equity 
you have in your company, in the Search box at the Report Center’s upper right, 
type equity and then press Enter. A Search Results tab appears with a list of 
reports that include equity, such as Balance Sheet Standard, Net Worth Graph, 
and Balance Sheet Prev Year Comparison.
 NOTE 	 If you type more than one keyword, your search results are likely to grow longer, not shorter, because 
QuickBooks looks for reports that contain any of the keywords you provide, rather than reports that contain all 
of them.
Running Reports
While you’re learning about QuickBooks’ reports, stick with the Report Center (de­
scribed in the previous section). Once you’re more familiar with what the program’s 
reports do, the Reports menu is the quickest route to running them, as shown in 
Figure 23-3. Or you can click one of the report links scattered throughout QuickBooks’ 
windows, menus, and centers. (The box on page 582 explains a shortcut you can 
use when you want to run several reports at the same time.)
 TIP 	 Out of the box, when you run a report, QuickBooks automatically opens it in a report window. However, 
if you find yourself customizing almost every report you run, you can tell QuickBooks to open the Modify Report 
dialog box first (see page 659). That way, you can make the changes you want before you see the report.
You can run reports from many locations in QuickBooks. Here’s how to run reports 
depending on which route you choose:
• Reports menu. This menu sits in the QuickBooks main menu bar. To run a re­
port, choose Reports, and then select the category you’re interested in (such 
as Memorized Reports, Company & Financial, or Vendors & Payables). On the 
submenu that appears (Figure 23-3), choose the report you want to run. (If 
another submenu appears, drag until you can pick the report you want.)

GEM IN THE ROUGH
Running Multiple Reports
Perhaps you perform the same tasks every month—calling 
customers with overdue invoices, checking inventory, and 
reviewing sales by item, for example—and you need reports 
to complete each task. Particularly when you print reports, 
you might sit in front of your computer with nothing but an 
occasional click to break the monotony, while QuickBooks 
slowly transforms your data into printed reports one at a time.
But you don’t have to do it that way. Tucked away on the 
Reports menu is the Process Multiple Reports feature, which 
generates all the reports you choose, one after the other. You 
can stock your printer with paper, make sure the toner cartridge 
isn’t running low, and then use this feature to run dozens of 
reports while you do something else.
Process Multiple Reports works only with memorized reports, 
because you don’t get the opportunity to customize the reports 
it runs. So customize each report you run regularly to make sure 
it includes the correct information and is formatted the way 
you want, and then memorize each one (page 601).
When you choose Reports→Process Multiple Reports, Quick-
Books opens the Process Multiple Reports window. It lists 
built-in reports along with all your memorized reports in the 
order they appear on the Memorized Reports submenu. To 
include a report in the batch you want to run, click its checkmark 
cell to turn the checkmark on. The Date Range column shows 
the period covered by the report. To change the range, type 
the dates you want in the report’s From and To cells. When all 
the reports you want have checkmarks and the correct date 
range, click Display to make QuickBooks open report windows 
for each selected report. If you’d rather have hard copies of 
the reports, click Print instead, and QuickBooks opens the Print 
Reports dialog box. All you have to do is choose the printer 
and the number of copies, and then click Print to start pushing 
reports through the printer.
Another way to run multiple reports is to create a report group 
with all the reports you want to run (see the box on page 604). 
Call it something like QuarterlyReports or EndofYearReports. 
Then you can run the reports by opening the Memorized Re-
ports window (Reports→Memorized Reports→Memorized 
Reports List). Right-click the report group you want to run, and 
then choose Process Group on the shortcut menu that appears. 
The Process Multiple Reports dialog box opens with the Select 
Memorized Reports From box set to the report group you chose 
and automatically turns on the checkboxes for all the reports in 
that group, as shown in Figure 23-4. Simply click Print to make 
QuickBooks print them all.

FIGURE 23-4
The Date Range column is 
grayed out because you 
can’t choose a different 
date range there. However, 
the From and To columns’ 
backgrounds are white, 
which means you can 
change the starting and 
ending dates for reports. 
(If you adjust any dates, 
the report’s Date Range 
cell changes to read “Cus-
tom.”) Simply turn on the 
appropriate checkmarks, 
and then click Display or 
Print to run your reports.
 NOTE 	 Some features on reports should remain consistent across every report your company generates, such 
as whether you use cash or accrual accounting (page xxii describes the difference between the two methods). 
A QuickBooks administrator can set company-wide report preferences to ensure that summary reports show 
financial information correctly and consistently. But even without administrator powers, you can still specify a 
few settings for the reports and graphs you run. See page 659 to learn how.
It takes QuickBooks time to generate some reports because they pull data from every 
corner of your company file. If you’re hunkering down to a report-running session 
of epic proportions, here are some tips for speeding things up:
• Wait until everyone else has logged out of the company file.
• If possible, log into QuickBooks from the computer that contains the company 
file. Otherwise, log into the fastest computer on your network that runs Quick­
Books.
• Before running reports, switch the file to single-user mode by choosing 
File→“Switch to Single-user Mode” (page 489).
In QuickBooks 2015, report formatting received a makeover, as shown in Figure 23-
5. Top-level categories are now shaded with a medium gray, lower-level categories 
are shaded beige, and totals are shaded a lighter gray.

ADDING 
COMMENTS TO 
REPORTS
FIGURE 23-5
Reports in QuickBooks 2015 
are easier to read now 
that headings and totals 
are shaded with different 
hues. 
Although you can change 
the fonts for different 
parts of a report (page 
600), you can’t change the 
shading that QuickBooks 
applies.
Adding Comments to Reports
Sometimes, you have information or feedback on reports that you want to share 
with others. For example, say you’re sending your Balance Sheet report to your 
accountant and you want to tell him that you haven’t recorded the fixed assets you 
purchased this year. Or perhaps you want to know whether the increase in product 
revenue is likely to continue. New in QuickBooks 2015, you can add comments to 
any line of a report. Here’s how:
1.	 Run the report you want, such as Profit & Loss Standard (choose Reports→ 
Company & Financial→Profit & Loss Standard).
In the report window’s Dates box, choose the date range you want, such as 
This Fiscal Year.
2.	 In the report window’s button bar, click “Comment on Report.”
The “Comment on Report: [report name]” window opens. You’ll see small 
comment boxes to the right of the values in the rightmost column, as shown 
in Figure 23-6.

Chapter 23: Tracking Finances with Reports and Graphs
585
ADDING 
COMMENTS TO 
REPORTS
FIGURE 23-6
When you click a comment 
box, QuickBooks numbers 
the comment and opens a 
text box in the Comments 
pane at the bottom of 
the window. After you 
add your comment, click 
Save. The Comments tab 
displays the number of 
comments added to the 
report. To collapse the 
Comments pane, click the 
down-pointing chevron 
(circled). To expand the 
collapsed Comments pane, 
click the up-pointing 
chevron on the Comments 
tab (not shown here).
3.	 To add a comment to a line of the report, click that line’s comment box.
QuickBooks adds a number to the comment box to identify the comment and 
opens the Comments pane at the bottom of the window, as shown in Figure 23-6.
4.	 In the Comment pane’s text box, type your comment, and then click the 
pane’s Save button.
The comment you just added appears in the Comments pane, and the total 
number of comments in the report appears on the Comments tab.
5.	 Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add additional comments to the report.
QuickBooks numbers comments in the order that you add them, not in sequence 
from the top of the report to the bottom.

6.	 When you’ve added all your comments, click the Save button at the win­
dow’s top left.
The Save Your Commented Report dialog box opens.
7.	 In the Name box, type the name of your report, such as “P&L 2015 Questions 
from Blake,” and then click OK.
In the message box that tells you that the report was saved, click OK.
8.	 To close the “Comment on Report” window, click the X at its top right. 
That’s it! To view commented reports, choose Reports→Commented Reports. In the 
Commented Reports window, double-click the report you want to open.
 NOTE 	 You can’t customize a commented report. For example, if you want to change the report’s date range, 
you have to run the report again and add new comments to it.
Printing and Saving Reports
You can turn any QuickBooks report into either a hard copy or an electronic file. 
Printing a report is easy: In the toolbar at the top of the report’s window, click 
Print→Report. In the Print Reports dialog box that opens, QuickBooks offers most 
of the same printing options you find in other programs, as shown in Figure 23-7.
FIGURE 23-7
Select the Printer option 
here and then, in the 
Printer drop-down list, 
choose where you want to 
send the report. You can 
print reports in portrait 
or landscape orientation, 
and specify the pages you 
want to print, how many 
copies, where you want 
page breaks, and whether 
to use color. If a report is 
a bit too wide or too tall 
to fit on one page, turn on 
the appropriate “Fit report 
to” checkboxes, which 
force the report onto the 
number of pages you 
specify.

Chapter 23: Tracking Finances with Reports and Graphs
587
PRINTING 
AND SAVING 
REPORTS
In the Print Reports dialog box, the Page Breaks section has two checkboxes that 
control where QuickBooks places page breaks:
• Smart page breaks (widow/orphan control). This checkbox is turned on 
initially. It tells QuickBooks to insert page breaks in judicious locations to keep 
associated information on the same page. To stuff as much report as possible 
onto the fewest pages, turn off this checkbox. When you do, QuickBooks prints 
to the very last line of a page, even if it means that a single row of a section 
appears on one page with the rest of the section on another. (The box below 
describes other ways to squeeze more report onto a page.)
• Page break after each major grouping. Turn on this checkbox (which appears 
only if your report is more than one page long) to add a page break after major 
sections of the report, like Income and Expenses in a Profit & Loss report. When 
this checkbox is turned off (as it is initially), the report starts new sections on 
the same page.
WORKAROUND WORKSHOP
Fitting More Report onto Each Page
When a report is rife with columns, it’s hard to fit everything 
onto a single piece of paper. QuickBooks automatically prints 
the columns that don’t fit on additional pages, but reports that 
span multiple pages cause paper rustling and lots of grumbling. 
Try these approaches for keeping your reports to one page:
• Before you click Print, reduce the width of the columns. 
In the report’s window, drag the three vertical dots to 
the right of a column’s heading to the left to make that 
column narrower, as shown in Figure 23-13, top (page 596).
• To limit the number of pages from left to right, click 
Print→Report in a report’s window and then, in the Print 
Reports dialog box, turn on the “Fit report to _ page(s) 
wide” checkbox and, in the text box, type the number of 
pages wide that you want. To limit the number of pages 
from top to bottom, turn on the “Fit report to _ page(s) 
high” checkbox and, in the text box, type the number 
of pages high.
• In the Print Reports dialog box’s Orientation section, 
choose Landscape. When a report almost fits on an 8.5" 
× 11" sheet of paper, switching to landscape orientation 
should do the trick. Better yet, if your printer can handle 
it, use legal-size paper (8.5" × 14").
Saving Reports as Files
If you save a report as a file, you can feed it to other programs to edit it in ways that 
you can’t in QuickBooks. Intuit gives you four ways to transform reports into files. 
The Print Reports dialog box lets you create three kinds of files: ASCII text files, 
comma-delimited files, and tab-delimited files. But you can also create comma-
delimited files and Excel workbooks by clicking Excel in any report window’s button 
bar. (The comma-delimited files that you create in either place are identical, so you 
can generate them whichever way you prefer.) You can also save forms and reports 
as PDF files or create versions to email.
 TIP 	 If you plan to import a report into another program, go with a tab- or comma-delimited file, which uses 
tab characters or commas to separate each value. Many programs can read files in these formats.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
588
PRINTING 
AND SAVING 
REPORTS
Here are the four ways you can create files for reports and the differences among 
them:
• Save to file from the Print Reports dialog box. In a report’s window, click 
Print→Report to open the Print Reports dialog box. Just below the Printer 
option is the File option, which has a drop-down list that includes “ASCII text 
file,” “Comma delimited file,” and “Tab delimited file.” After you choose the File 
option and select a type of file, click Print and QuickBooks opens the Create Disk 
File dialog box, which is just a File Save As dialog box where you can specify a 
filename and where to save the file.
 NOTE 	 The ASCII text format produces a text file that looks like your report, but it uses different fonts and 
space characters to position values in columns. This type of file isn’t suitable for importing into spreadsheets or 
other programs, but you can use it to store an electronic version of your report.
• Export to spreadsheet file. In a report window’s button bar, click Excel, and 
then choose Create New Worksheet or Update Existing Worksheet to open the 
“Send Report to Excel” dialog box shown in Figure 23-8. There, depending on 
which option you chose, QuickBooks selects the “Create new worksheet” or 
“Update an existing worksheet” option. Click Export to open the report in Excel.
If you select the “Replace an existing worksheet” option, the “Select workbook” 
box and “Select a sheet” drop-down list appear. After you specify the workbook 
and worksheet that you want to replace and then click Export, QuickBooks 
replaces the contents of that worksheet with the report.
FIGURE 23-8
In a report window’s button bar, click 
Excel→Create New Worksheet or 
Excel→Update Existing Worksheet to open this 
dialog box.
If you choose Create New Worksheet, Quick-
Books selects the “Create new worksheet” op-
tion here, but you can choose whichever option 
you want. If you select the “Create a comma 
separated values (.csv) file” option, then when 
you click Export, the program opens the Create 
Disk File dialog box, which is described in this 
section.

Chapter 23: Tracking Finances with Reports and Graphs
589
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
 TIP 	 QuickBooks is smart about exchanging report information with Excel. When you export a report to an 
existing worksheet, QuickBooks can update the worksheet while keeping most of the changes you’ve made to it, 
such as formulas and formatting.
If you choose the “Create a comma separated values (.csv) file” option and then 
click Export, QuickBooks opens the Create Disk File dialog box, where you can 
type a filename and choose where to save the file.
If you want to tell QuickBooks how to set up the Excel spreadsheet, before 
clicking Export, click Advanced, choose your settings, and then click OK. The 
Advanced Excel Options dialog box has three sections for setting up a report 
in Excel. The first section focuses on whether to transfer the fonts, colors, and 
spacing that you set up in your QuickBooks reports to the Excel workbook. 
The second section provides checkboxes for turning on Excel features such as 
AutoFit, which makes columns wide enough to display all the data they contain. 
And the third section lets you decide whether you want the report’s header to 
appear in the Excel header area (which appears at the top of the printed report) 
or at the top of the worksheet’s grid.
• Save as a PDF file. To save a report as a PDF (Acrobat) file, run the report and 
then, in the report window, choose Print→Save As PDF. In the “Save document 
as PDF” dialog box, navigate to the folder where you want to save the file, type 
a filename in the “File name” box, and then click Save.
 TIP 	 Choosing Print→Save As PDF also works for saving forms like invoices and sales receipts as PDFs. 
Just select this option on the corresponding window’s Main tab. (When you tell QuickBooks to email a form, it 
automatically creates a PDF file of the form and attaches it to the email message.)
• Email an Excel file or PDF file. To email a report, in the report’s window, click 
E-mail, and then choose “Send report as Excel” or “Send report as PDF.”
Customizing Reports
Report windows are teeming with ways to customize reports. Some tools are easy 
to spot, like the buttons and drop-down lists at the top of the window. But you can 
also drag and right-click elements in reports to make smaller changes. This section 
describes all the techniques you can use to make reports display exactly what you 
want.
Here’s where you go to customize a report:
• Run custom reports from the Reports menu. If you make it through all of 
QuickBooks’ report categories without finding the report you want, the Reports 
menu includes two entries for building custom reports from scratch. Choose 
Reports→Custom Reports and then choose Summary to build a report that dis­
plays subtotals by some kinds of categories. For instance, you could customize a 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
590
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
summary report to create an income statement for all customers of a particular 
type. Choosing Reports→Custom Reports→Transaction Detail, on the other 
hand, lets you customize transaction reports to show exactly the fields you want.
As soon as you choose one of these custom report options, QuickBooks opens 
both the report window and the Modify Report dialog box—because a custom 
report needs some kind of customization. You can set up the contents and ap­
pearance of the report any way you want, as shown in Figure 23-9. For a custom 
transaction report, the Modify Report dialog box includes a list of fields that 
you can turn on and off, as well as checkboxes for specifying how you want to 
sort and total the results.
FIGURE 23-9
In addition to date 
ranges, filters, and other 
customizations, you can 
control what appears in 
a custom report’s rows 
and columns. The “Display 
columns by” and “Display 
rows by” drop-down lists 
include many of the same 
choices, so you can set up 
a report to show your data 
either across or down. (A 
report that uses the same 
category for both columns 
and rows doesn’t make 
any sense, so be sure to 
choose different entries for 
columns and rows.)
 NOTE 	 The Modify Report dialog box’s “Display columns by” drop-down list includes date ranges and the 
“Total only” option. If you want to customize your report, you can turn on checkboxes for comparing values with 
previous periods as well as showing dollar and percentage differences, like Budget vs. Actual reports do.
• Report window button bar. The bar across the top of a report window includes 
the Customize Report button, which opens the all-powerful customization tool 
you just learned about—the Modify Report dialog box. This bar also includes 
other handy customization buttons like Hide Header and Collapse, discussed 
in the box on page 590.
• Report window toolbar. Below the button bar is a customization toolbar where 
you can choose the date range, the columns to display, and which column to 
use for sorting the report’s contents.

Chapter 23: Tracking Finances with Reports and Graphs
591
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
• Report window. Hidden within the report itself are a few customization features. 
For example, by right-clicking text in a report, you can format its appearance. 
Dragging the three vertical dots between column headings changes the column 
width and, for detail reports, you can drag columns to new locations.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Viewing More of a Report
How can I see more of a report on my screen?
If your computer monitor is a closer relative to your mobile 
phone than to your widescreen TV, you can use a couple of 
techniques to stuff more of the report onto your screen:
• Hide Header. While you’re working on a report, you don’t 
need the report’s header to tell you which type of report 
you’re viewing, your company’s name, or the date range. 
In the report window’s button bar, click Hide Header to 
hide the report’s header and display more content. (The 
printed report that you send to others still includes the 
header.) To redisplay the hidden header, in the button 
bar, click Show Header.
• Collapse. If the report window’s button bar has a Collapse 
button, you can click it to get a high-level view of a 
report that hides subaccounts, the individual jobs for 
your customers, and subclasses. When you click Collapse, 
QuickBooks totals the results for the subaccounts, jobs, 
or subclasses under the main account, customer, or class, 
respectively. Unlike the Hide Header button, the Collapse 
button affects your onscreen view and the printed report. 
To redisplay the collapsed entries, click Expand.
Choosing Date Ranges
Different reports call for different date ranges. Financial statements, for example, 
typically use fiscal periods, such as the last fiscal quarter or the current fiscal year. 
But many companies manage month by month, so your reports may cover the current 
month or month to date. Payroll reports span whatever period you use for payroll, 
whether that’s one week, two weeks, or a calendar month. And tax reports depend 
on the tax periods required by the tax agencies you answer to.
The best place to choose a report’s date range depends on how much you intend 
to modify the report:
• If the date range is the only thing you want to change, the report window’s 
toolbar is the way to go. In the Dates drop-down list, choose the range you want, 
or, in the From and To boxes, pick a starting date and ending date for the report.
• If you plan to change more than the date, in the report window, click the 
Customize Report button. In the Modify Report dialog box that appears, the 
Report Date Range section includes the same date-setting features as the re­
port window’s toolbar, as well as several additional tabs and sections for every 
other type of customization.
QuickBooks has two dozen preset date ranges that work based on today’s date. 
For example, if it’s March 15, 2015, and your company uses the calendar year as its 
fiscal year, then This Fiscal Year represents January 1 through December 31, 2015, 
but Today is simply 3/15/2015. And, if none of the program’s date ranges do what 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
592
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
you want, in the report window’s toolbar, you can set specific start and end dates 
in the From and To boxes.
The preset date ranges are numerous because they mix and match several types 
of ranges.
• Durations. Some preset periods represent durations, such as Week, Month, 
Fiscal Quarter, Fiscal Year, and Tax Year. At the extremes, you can pick All to 
encompass every date in your company file, or Today, which includes only today.
• This, Last, and Next. For each duration, you can choose the current period 
(such as This Fiscal Quarter), the previous period (Last Fiscal Quarter), or the 
upcoming period (Next Fiscal Quarter).
• Full and to-date. You can also pick between a full period and the period up to 
today’s date. For example, on March 15, “This Month” covers March 1 through 
March 31, and “This Month-to-date” represents March 1 through March 15.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks includes one additional date-range option: Next 4 Weeks, which many businesses use 
when checking cash flow.
Selecting Subtotals
Many of QuickBooks’ built-in reports calculate subtotals. For instance, Profit & Loss 
summary reports include subtotals by income, cost of goods sold, expenses, and 
so on. Sales reports by customer subtotal the sales for all the jobs you do for each 
customer.
When you run a detail report, such as Sales by Customer Detail, the report shows 
every relevant transaction, and you can subtotal the results in any way that makes 
sense for that type of report, as shown in Figure 23-10.
Depending on the report you pick, some choices in the Modify Report dialog box’s 
“Total by” drop-down list are more appropriate than others. For example, you might 
decide to subtotal a sales report by customer type, rep, or account list to see which 
types of customer provide the most business, which sales rep makes the most sales, 
or which income account pulls in the most money. If you choose a “Total by” option 
that doesn’t jibe with the report you’ve run, the report displays a zero balance and 
no rows of data.
Customizing Columns
Some reports start with only one column, but they don’t have to stay that way. De­
pending on the type of report, you can change its columns in several ways, like show­
ing columns for each time period or choosing fields to display in separate columns. 
And if you find that your appetite for columns is larger than your monitor, you can 
remove, resize, and reorder report columns. This section explains all your options.

Chapter 23: Tracking Finances with Reports and Graphs
593
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
FIGURE 23-10
When you run a report 
with transaction details, 
QuickBooks picks a cat-
egory to subtotal by. For 
example, the Sales by Cus-
tomer Detail report starts 
with sales subtotaled by 
customer.
To change the subtotal 
category, in the report’s 
window, click Custom-
ize Report. Then, in the 
Modify Report dialog box 
(foreground), choose 
another field in the “Total 
by” box, like “Class” or 
“Customer type.”
ADDING AND REMOVING COLUMNS IN SUMMARY REPORTS
As you manage your business, you’ll want to see results for different date ranges 
in the reports you generate. For example, during a year, you might create a Profit & 
Loss report to show your financial status by month, for each fiscal quarter, and for 
the entire year. If the report window’s toolbar includes a Show Columns drop-down 
list (as it does for summary reports), choosing an entry there is the quickest way 
to change the categories that columns represent (see Figure 23-11). You can make 
the same changes in the Modify Report dialog box by using the “Display columns 
by” drop-down list.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
594
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
FIGURE 23-11
In a report window’s 
toolbar, the Show Columns 
drop-down list sets the 
categories for the columns 
in the report—basically, 
subtotaling by column. 
When you choose Quarter, 
for example, the report 
changes from a single, 
yearlong total to columns 
that subtotal each fiscal 
quarter (as shown here). 
Simply choose another 
category to slice results up 
differently. For example, 
choosing Class makes 
QuickBooks include a 
column for each class 
you use.
The Modify Report dialog box’s Display tab provides different comparison check­
boxes for each type of report. For example, when you click the Customize Report 
button in a Profit & Loss report’s window, you’ll see checkboxes that let you compare 
results with the previous period, previous year, or the year to date, and show dollar 
and percentage comparisons. If you want to focus on the percentage difference, 
for instance, then turn off the “$ Change” checkbox and turn on the “% Change” 
checkbox instead. (If you use multiple currencies, your reports can contain curren­
cies other than U.S. dollars. For that reason, when the multiple currency preference 
is turned on, the “$ Change” checkboxes are simply labeled “Change.”)
The Modify Report dialog box for some reports even includes checkboxes such as “% 
of Column,” “% of Row,” “% of Income,” and “% of Expense.” If you generate a profit 
and loss report by quarter and turn on the “% of Row” checkbox, for example, the 
report shows each quarter’s performance as a percentage of the full year’s results.
ADDING OR REMOVING COLUMNS IN DETAIL REPORTS
Reports that show transaction details, such as Profit & Loss Detail or Inventory 
Valuation Detail, include columns for data fields like Date, Name, Cost, and Memo. 
To change the columns that appear in a detail report, in the report’s window, click 
Customize Report, and then choose the columns you want to add or remove, as 
shown in Figure 23-12.

field’s name to remove it

RESIZING AND MOVING COLUMNS
Some columns seem to take up more room than they need, while others truncate 
their contents. Figure 23-13 shows how to resize columns and rearrange the order 
in which they appear.
 NOTE 	 When you resize columns in some reports, like ones with columns for each month, a Resize Columns 
dialog box asks if you want to set all the columns to the same size. Click Yes to resize all the columns, or No to 
resize only the one.

Top: Three vertical dots 
indicate the end of a column 
heading. If you mouse over 
one of these dividers, your 
cursor turns into a two-
headed arrow. Drag to the 
right to make the column on 
the left wider, or to the left to 
make that column narrower. 
Bottom: In detailed and list 
reports, when you put your 
cursor over a column heading, 
it turns into a hand icon to 
indicate that you can move 
the column to another loca-
tion. As you drag, the pointer 
shows both the hand icon 
and the name of the column. 
When you get close to the left 
side of a column, a red arrow 
(circled) appears to show 
where the column will end 
up if you release the mouse 
button.
 TIP 	 To remove a column from a report, drag the three dots shown in Figure 23-13 to the left past another 
column’s divider.
Sorting Reports
If a report is sortable, you’ll see the Sort By box in the report window’s toolbar. 
When you first generate a sortable report, the Sort By box is set to Default, which 

Chapter 23: Tracking Finances with Reports and Graphs
597
CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
means different things for different reports. For example, if you create a Sales by 
Customer Detail report, QuickBooks groups transactions by customer, but it sorts 
each customer’s transactions from earliest to most recent. (QuickBooks sorts reports 
by only one field at a time.)
In the Sort By drop-down list, choose the column you want to use to sort the report. 
As soon as you change the Sort By box to something other than Default, the Ascend­
ing/Descending button appears to the right of the Sort By box. (It has a blue arrow 
and the letters A and Z on it; A appears above Z when the sort order is ascending, 
and Z appears above A when the sort order is descending.) Clicking this button 
toggles between sorting in ascending and descending order.
The fields you can use to sort depend on the report. For the Sales by Customer Sum­
mary report, for example, the Sort By box lets you choose from only two columns: 
Default and Total. Default sorts the report by customer name in alphabetical order, 
whereas Total sorts the report by the total sales for each customer, from the small­
est to the largest dollar amount. On the other hand, the Sales by Customer Detail 
report includes several columns of information, and you can sort by any of them.
 NOTE 	 The Modify Report dialog box’s Display tab also includes a Sort By drop-down list. In this dialog box, 
select the Ascending or Descending option to change the sort order.
Filtering Reports
Detail reports (the ones that list individual transactions) might show more informa­
tion than you want. For example, a Purchases by Item Detail report could run page 
after page, listing your weekly purchases of Turtle Chow. Filtering a report removes 
transactions that don’t meet your criteria, so you can home in on just the Turtle Chow 
purchases from Myrtle’s Turtle Mart.
In QuickBooks, you can apply as many filters as you want at the same time. Each filter 
adds one test that a transaction has to pass to appear in your report. For example, 
when you set the date range for a report, what you’re really doing is adding a filter 
that restricts transactions to the ones that happened between the starting and 
ending dates. Then, if you want to find the sales for only your corporate customers, 
you can add a filter based on the Customer Type field.
QuickBooks provides dozens of filters, from the most common—such as dates, 
items, and transaction types—to those you won’t apply very often (if ever), such 
as Workers Comp Codes and FOB (that’s “free on board,” discussed on page 235).
Built-in reports already have filters, but you can customize a built-in report by adding 
extra filters or editing or removing the existing ones. Here’s how:
1.	 In the report’s window, click Customize Report and then, in the Modify 
Report dialog box, click the Filters tab.
The left side of the tab lets you choose the field you want to filter by and specify 
the filter’s test. The right side of the tab lists all the filters that are currently applied.

REPORTS
2.	 In the left-hand filter list, select the field you want to filter by.
Depending on the field you choose, QuickBooks offers different criteria. Figure 
23-14 shows one example.
FIGURE 23-14
When you pick a field in 
the Choose Filter list on 
the left, the criteria for 
that field appear.
If you’re not sure what 
a field and its criteria 
settings do, click the 
“Tell me more” button to 
open the QuickBooks Help 
window to the topic about 
that filter.
3.	 Using the drop-down lists or options that appear, specify the filter criteria 
you want to apply.
For instance, if you filter by account, in the Account drop-down list, you can 
choose a category such as “All bank accounts”; choose “Multiple accounts” and 
then click each one you want to include; or click a single account. Whatever 
option you choose, QuickBooks adds the filter to the right-hand Filter list (in 
the Current Filter Choices section).
If you choose a numeric field, you can select a test, like “>=” (greater than or 
equal to) and then specify the test value. For example, to look for invoices that 
are late by 30 days or more, choose Aging for the filter, select the “>=” option, 
and then type 30 in the text box, as shown in Figure 23-14.
4.	 To remove a filter, select it in the right-hand Filter list, and then click Re­
move Selected Filter.
QuickBooks removes the filter from the list.
5.	 To edit a filter, in the right-hand Filter list, select the filter you want to 
change. Then, in the Choose Filter section, make the changes you want.
6.	 Click OK to see your report with the new filters applied.

CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
Report Headers and Footers
You don’t have complete control over what appears in report headers and footers, 
but you can choose from several fields common to all of them. For example, fields 
like Company Name, Report Title, and Date Prepared are options for headers, and 
Page Number is one option for footers. To change the header and footer contents 
of the report you’re working on, in the Modify Report dialog box, click the Header/
Footer tab (Figure 23-15).
FIGURE 23-15
To realign the header and 
footer contents, in the 
Alignment drop-down 
list, choose Left, Right, 
Centered, or Standard.
QuickBooks initially 
chooses Standard, which 
centers the Company name 
and title; places the date, 
time, and report basis 
(cash or accrual) on the 
left; and puts the extra 
footer line (explained 
below) and page number 
in the left and right 
corners of the footer.
 NOTE 	 You may notice that, on the Modify Report dialog box’s Header/Footer tab, the Date Prepared drop-
down list reads something like “12/31/01.” Don’t worry: That date doesn’t mean that QuickBooks gathers data 
from 2001. The Date Prepared setting simply lets you choose the date format that the report uses.
QuickBooks automatically pulls data from your company file to fill in the header and 
footer text boxes. For example, if you use a built-in Sales by Customer Detail report, 
the program puts your company’s name in the Company Name box. If you have a 
more eloquent title for the report, type it in the Report Title box.
 TIP 	 To set standards for all report headers and footers, choose Edit→Preferences→Reports & Graphs and 
then click the Company Preferences tab. If the “Default formatting for reports” checkbox is turned on, turn it off, 
and then click the Format button. In the Report Format Preferences dialog box that appears, set the fields you 
want.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

CUSTOMIZING 
REPORTS
The Header/Footer tab’s Show Footer Information section includes an Extra Footer 
Line box where you can type whatever you want. This text isn’t associated with any 
field in QuickBooks, so it’s blank unless you enter something. Whatever you type 
here appears in the bottom left of the report page.
The last checkbox in both the Show Header Information and Show Footer Information 
sections controls the pages on which the headers and footers appear. To conserve 
paper, turn off the “Print header on pages after first page” checkbox so QuickBooks 
includes the header on the first page only. To omit the page number from the first 
page, turn off the “Print footer on first page” checkbox.
The right side of the Header/Footer tab is the Page Layout section, which gives you 
some control over the position of header and footer fields, as explained in Figure 
23-15.
Fonts and Numbers
The fonts and formatting you use to display numbers in reports doesn’t change the 
underlying financial message, but an attractive and easy-to-read report can make 
a good impression. Just like the fields that appear in the header and footer, you can 
set QuickBooks’ preferences to assign the same font and number formats for all 
your reports (see page 661). On the other hand, changing fonts directly in a report 
is quick and has the added advantage of letting you see exactly what the report 
looks like with the new formatting, as Figure 23-16 shows.
If you already have the Modify Report dialog box open, click the Fonts & Numbers 
tab. The Fonts section on the left side of the tab lists the different text elements in 
the report, such as Column Labels, Company Name, and Transactions. To change 
a font, select an element, and then click the Change Font button, which opens the 
same dialog box you get when you right-click the element in the report (shown in 
Figure 23-16).
The right side of the Fonts & Numbers tab has options for changing the appear­
ance of numbers. Negative numbers are usually something to pay attention to in 
the financial world, so accountants use several methods to make them stand out. If 
you’re not sure which style of negative number you like, choose an option and then 
check out the number in the Example area. You have three style choices:
• Normally. This option shows negative numbers preceded by a minus sign: –1200.
• In Parentheses. This option puts negative numbers in parentheses without a 
minus sign: (1200).
• With a Trailing Minus. This option places the minus sign after the number: 1200–.
 TIP 	 If you use a color printer or display reports on your computer screen, they you can make negative numbers 
even harder to ignore by turning on the In Bright Red checkbox.

FIGURE 23-16
In a report window, 
right-click the text you 
want to format, such as a 
row label, a column label, 
or a value. Then change 
the format in the dialog 
box that opens (the name 
of the dialog box depends 
on which report element 
you’re formatting, but the 
choices are the same for 
every element). When you 
click OK, QuickBooks opens 
a Changing Font dialog box 
that asks if you want to 
change all related fonts. If 
you click No, it changes the 
font for only the element 
you chose. If you click 
Yes, it changes related 
elements—often the entire 
report. If you don’t like the 
format, right-click the text 
and try something else.
To make big numbers easier to read, in the Show All Numbers section, turn on the 
Divided By 1000 checkbox. This removes one trio of zeros from numbers in the 
report—so that $350,000,000 shows up as $350,000, for example—and adds “($ 
in 1,000’s)” to the report’s header. And, if a summary report (such as Customer Bal­
ance Summary) tends to contain mostly zero values, you can keep it lean by turning 
on the Except Zero Amounts checkbox. That way, the report omits any rows whose 
values are zero, such as customers who don’t owe you any money. (This checkbox 
doesn’t appear on the Fonts & Numbers tab if you’re customizing a transaction-based 
report, such as Customer Balance Detail.) Turn on the Without Cents checkbox to 
show only whole dollars.
Memorizing Reports
If you take the time to customize a report so it looks just the way you want, it’d be 
silly to jump through those same hoops every time you run that report. By memoriz­
ing modified reports, you can run them again and again with all your customizations 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
602
MEMORIZING 
REPORTS
just by choosing Reports→Memorized Reports, and then picking the report’s name 
on the appropriate submenu.
When you memorize a report, QuickBooks remembers your settings—like date range 
and filter criteria—but not the data itself. So if you memorize a report whose date 
range is set to This Month, for example, the report shows the results for June when 
you run it in June and results for December when you run it in December.
Here’s how to memorize a report you’ve customized:
1.	 Review the report to make sure it has the info and formatting you want.
If you notice later that you missed a setting, you can make that change and 
memorize the report again.
2.	 In the report’s window, click the Memorize button.
QuickBooks opens the Memorize Report dialog box, which is small and to the 
point. If you’re memorizing a standard report, the dialog box contains a Name 
box and a checkbox for choosing a memorized report group.
If you’re rememorizing an existing memorized report, the dialog box contains 
Replace, New, and Cancel buttons. Click Replace to rememorize the existing 
report with the new settings, or click New to create a new memorized report 
from the current one.
 NOTE 	 You can also share memorized reports with others in the Intuit Community, as described in the box 
on page 579. To share a memorized report while the Memorize Report dialog box is open, turn on the “Share this 
report template with others” checkbox.
3.	 In the Name box, type a name that indicates what the report shows, like 
Deadbeat Customers.
4.	 If you want to save the report in a special group, turn on the Save in Memo­
rized Report Group checkbox, and then choose the appropriate group.
QuickBooks comes with several built-in groups like Accountant, Company, and 
Customers, which appear on the Memorized Reports submenu shown in Figure 
23-17. But you can also create your own groups, as the box on page 604 explains.
5.	 Click OK to memorize the report.
Voilà—you’re done. If you’re going to use the report over and over, consider 
adding it to the Favorite Reports menu (page 579) or to the icon bar (page 
704) so you can run it by choosing it from the Report→Favorite Reports menu 
or clicking its icon, respectively.

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
The Memorized Group Doesn’t Exist
The Memorize Report dialog box doesn’t include a way to create 
a new memorized group. That’s because you have to create a 
memorized group before you can add a report to it. Here’s the 
secret to creating a memorized group:
1.	 Choose Reports→Memorized Reports→Memorized 
Report List. QuickBooks opens the Memorized Report 
List window, which includes memorized groups and the 
reports they contain. 
2.	 At the bottom of the window, click Memorized Report→ 
New Group.
3.	 In the New Memorized Report Group dialog box, type the 
group’s name, and then click OK.
Now, when you memorize a report, the new group appears in 
the Save in Memorized Report Group drop-down list.
Swapping Reports Between Company Files
Suppose you’re one of several business owners who meet to share ideas. Some of 
your colleagues rave about the QuickBooks reports they’ve customized, and you’d 
like to use the reports they’ve created. If they’re willing to share their ideas, you can 
swap reports by trading report template files. Or, if you want to share your reports 
with a broader audience, you can share them with the whole Intuit Community as 
described in the box on page 579.
Report templates contain the layouts, filters, and formatting of memorized reports. 
Someone can export a memorized report as a report template, and someone else 
can then import that template to save the report in a different company file. For 
example, if your accountant likes to see information in very specific ways, she can 
give you a report template file so you can produce the reports she wants to see.
Report templates play well between different editions of QuickBooks (Premier, Pro, 
and Enterprise) and from version to version (2014, 2015, and so on). However, here 
are a couple of points to keep in mind:
• If you use QuickBooks Pro, you can only import templates that others create. You 
need QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise Solutions to export report templates.
• QuickBooks patches can affect the compatibility between versions, so you 
might have to install the most recent QuickBooks update if you want to use 
someone else’s report templates. (If there’s an update or version incompatibility 
issue with a report template you try to import, QuickBooks displays a warning 
to let you know.)

Exporting a Report Template
You can export report templates only if you have QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise 
Solutions. Whether you export one report or an entire group, QuickBooks stores the 
report settings in a single file with the file extension .qbr (for “QuickBooks report”). 
Because report templates are meant to move between QuickBooks company files, 
all you have to specify are the reports you want to export and the file to which you 
want to export them. Here’s the process:
1.	 Choose Reports→Memorized Reports→Memorized Report List.
QuickBooks opens the Memorized Report List window.
2.	 Select the report or memorized group that you want to export.
For example, if your customized reports are all memorized in a group you cre­
ated named Special Reports, select Special Reports.
 NOTE 	 In the Memorized Report List, you can select only a single report or a single group; you can’t Ctrl-click 
or Shift-click to select several individual reports.
3.	 Click Memorized Report→Export Template.
QuickBooks opens the Specify Filename for Export dialog box, which is nothing 
more than a Save As dialog box that automatically sets the file type to “Quick­
Books Report Files (*.QBR).” The program also puts the report or group’s name 
in the “File name” box. If you want to use a different name (one that includes 
the date you exported the reports, say), type it in that box.
4.	 Navigate to the folder where you want to save the template, and then click 
Save.
QuickBooks saves the settings for the report(s) to the file. 
The next section tells you how to import a report template.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks won’t export memorized reports with filters that reference an account, customer, or 
other entry specific to your company file, because those filters won’t work in a company file that doesn’t contain 
that account, customer, or entry. If you try to export a template for such a report, you see a message box that 
suggests you look for filter settings that wouldn’t work in another company file. 
Importing Report Templates
Importing reports from a template file is even easier than exporting report templates. 
In the Memorized Report List window (Reports→Memorized Reports→Memorized 
Report List), click Memorized Report→Import Template. QuickBooks opens the 
Select File to Import dialog box with the “Files of type” box set to “QuickBooks 
Reports Files (*.QBR).” All you have to do is navigate to the folder that contains 
the report template file and double-click the filename (or select the filename and 
then click Open).

When you do that, QuickBooks opens a different dialog box depending on whether 
you’re importing one report or a group:
• Single report. QuickBooks opens the Memorize Report dialog box. As you would 
if you were memorizing a custom report of your own design, in the Name box, 
type the name you want for the report and, if you wish, choose a memorized 
report group. Then click OK to save the report template in your company file.
• Report group. When you import a report group, QuickBooks opens the Import 
Memorized Reports Group With Name dialog box and fills in the Name box with 
the group’s name from the original company file, but you can type a different 
name. When you click OK, the program adds the group to your company file 
and saves all the imported reports in that group with their original names.
 NOTE 	 If you try to import a report or group with the same name as a report or group that’s already in your 
company file, QuickBooks displays a warning and recommends that you change the name of the report or group 
you’re importing. Click OK and then change the imported report or group’s name before saving it.

y synchronizing your real-world bank accounts with the bank accounts in 
QuickBooks, you can download your bank balances and transactions into your 
QuickBooks company file so you’ll always know how much cash you have on 
hand. (The connection you set up between the two is called bank feeds to differ­
entiate it from online banking that you perform by logging into your bank account 
outside of QuickBooks.) That way, before repaying your aunt the money she lent 
you to start your business, you can quickly update your QuickBooks accounts, check 
your balance, and be certain that you aren’t giving her a check that will bounce.
Besides managing your cash flow, banking online is much more convenient than 
the old paper-based methods of yesteryear. For example, you already have a lot of 
transactions in your QuickBooks account register (from depositing payments you 
received against invoices or making payments to your vendors) and you can easily 
match these transactions to the ones you download from the bank so you know 
how much money you really have in your account—and whether someone is help­
ing themselves to your money without permission. Plus you can transfer money 
between your money market account and your checking account when you find 
yourself awake at 2 a.m.
Banking online also lets you pay bills without having to print checks, lick stamps, or 
walk to the mailbox. After you submit payment transactions online, the billing service 
you use either transfers funds from your bank account to the vendors or generates 
and mails paper checks. Online billing also lets you set up recurring bills so you can 
go about your business without worrying about missing a payment.
All this convenience requires some setup. QuickBooks needs to know how to con­
nect to your bank, and your bank needs to know that you want to use its online

services. This chapter explains how to apply for online services with your financial 
institution and set up bank feeds in QuickBooks to perform all these tasks. Once 
your accounts and bank feeds are set up and online services activated, you’ll learn 
how to download transactions and make online payments. And if you enter transac­
tions in your company file, you’ll also learn about matching them with the ones you 
download—and correcting any discrepancies.
Setting Up Your Accounts for Online 
Services
Connecting your bank accounts to your accounts in QuickBooks is a lot like running 
a dating service: You have to prepare each participant for the relationship and then 
get them together. The services you can subscribe to and the price you pay depend 
on your financial institution, but they fall into one of these three categories:
• Banking account access. This service is usually free. It lets you check transac­
tion status and download transactions into QuickBooks.
• Credit/charge card access. You can download credit card transactions as you 
do checking transactions, as long as you set up your credit card in QuickBooks 
as a credit card account (page 378) and enter individual credit card charges. 
Setting up a credit card as a vendor and entering only the monthly bill payment 
won’t work.
• Bill payment. This service usually comes with a fee, but it’s often a good deal 
when you consider the price of stamps and printed checks.
 NOTE 	 Although QuickBooks can download transactions in different currencies, the program’s online bill 
payment feature works only with U.S. dollar–based accounts. So if you have a bank account that uses a foreign 
currency, you have to handle your transactions the old-fashioned way.
Applying for Online Services
The first step in linking QuickBooks to your bank accounts is to apply for online 
banking services with your financial institution. (If you use more than one bank, 
you have to apply to each one separately.) Contact your financial institution to find 
out how to apply.
When your financial institution processes your application and sends you a con­
firmation and a PIN (personal identification number) or password, check that the 
information you received, like the account number, is correct. Then you’re ready 
to set up your QuickBooks bank account to talk to your real-world bank account.
 NOTE 	 If your bank is behind the times and doesn’t offer online bill payment, Intuit is happy to earn more 
of your business with its add-on bill-pay service. To learn about it, choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Learn About 
Online Bill Payment. A browser window opens to the Intuit QuickBooks Bill Pay web page.

Activating Online Services for Your QuickBooks Account
When you receive a letter from your bank confirming that your online services are 
ready to go and you have your customer ID and password (or PIN), all you have to 
do is set up a bank feed for your corresponding account in QuickBooks to use these 
online services. The Bank Feed Setup wizard walks you through the steps:
1.	 Choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Set Up Bank Feed for an Account.
In the message box that opens, click Yes to give QuickBooks permission to 
close any open windows.
You can also start online setup in the Add New Account window (page 56). When 
you create a new account, type the account number and the routing number. 
Then, when you save the account, the Set Up Bank Feed message box asks if 
you want to set up online services. Click Yes to set it up now or No to do it later.
Yet a third option is to head to the Edit Account window (page 63) and then 
click the Set Up Bank Feeds button at the bottom of the window.
No matter which of these routes you choose, QuickBooks launches the Bank 
Feed Setup wizard.
2.	 On the “Step 1: Find your bank” screen (Figure 24-1), begin typing the name 
of your bank. When you see your bank’s name in the Matching Results list, 
click it. Or, if your financial institution is one of the more popular ones, 
simply click its link in the list on the right side of the dialog box.
QuickBooks connects to the Internet to download info about your bank. What 
you see depends on the type of connection your bank offers. If your bank con­
nects directly to QuickBooks (page 613), the screen that appears asks if you’ve 
enrolled in your bank’s online services. If you haven’t, call the bank’s number 
that’s displayed on the screen or click the link to its enrollment site. If your 
bank doesn’t communicate directly with QuickBooks, you’ll see the Manually 
Import Transactions dialog box instead, which explains—you guessed it—how 
to manually import transactions into your account (page 614).
3.	 When you’re ready to connect, click Continue.
The “Step 2: Connect [your bank’s name] to QuickBooks” screen appears.
4.	 Fill in the “[bank name] User ID” and “[bank name] Password” boxes, and 
then click Connect.
The User ID is the ID that the bank assigned to you for online services and 
should be on the confirmation letter it sent you. If you don’t have your ID and 
password, click the X at the dialog box’s top right to close it; you can repeat 
this process after you receive them.

5.	 The next screen displays the accounts you have at this financial institution. 
In the QuickBooks Accounts column, click the down arrow to the right of 
the “Select existing or create new” box for the account you want to activate

If QuickBooks runs into a problem connecting to your bank account—such as a 
typo in your user name or password—you’ll see an error message. In that case, 
click Back to correct the problem and try again.

 NOTE 	 If you signed up for online banking services with more than one account at the same financial 
institution, you have to repeat the steps in this section to activate each account at that institution.
Exchanging Data with Your Bank
Your financial institution takes the lead in controlling how QuickBooks can com­
municate with it. Your bank can set up this pipeline in two ways:
• Direct connection uses a secure Internet connection that links directly to your 
bank’s computers. With this type of connection to your financial institution, you 
can do things like download your bank statements and transactions, transfer 
funds between accounts, pay bills online, and email your bank (as long as your 
bank offers those services). If your bank uses a direct connection, you set up 
your requests for downloads, funds transfers, online bill payments, and emails 
in QuickBooks before you connect.
• Web Connect uses a secure connection to your bank’s website to download 
your statement info. With this type of connection, you then have to import the 
downloaded information into QuickBooks.
 NOTE 	 Regardless of the type of connection you have, remember that the online balance you see usually 
isn’t a true picture of your cash balance, because it doesn’t show all transactions, such as checks you’ve written 
that the bank hasn’t received.
Regardless of which type of connection you use, connecting to your financial institu­
tion begins in the Bank Feeds Center (choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Bank Feeds 
Center). The first step in the process is exchanging data with your bank; you send any 
online banking items you’ve created, like online bill payments or messages you want 
to send to your financial institution. Once you’ve exchanged data, QuickBooks tries 
to match the transactions in your company file with the ones you’ve downloaded. 
If it can’t match some of the transactions, you step in and tell it what to do. The rest 
of this chapter explains the whole process.
QuickBooks’ Online Banking Modes
The Bank Feeds Center offers two modes to satisfy everyone’s tastes. Express mode 
has so many nifty features, it’s the hands-down winner. Classic mode (known as 
Register mode in earlier versions of QuickBooks) is still around and comes in handy 
in a few situations. Here’s what each one does:
• Express mode. The best feature of this mode—which is covered in detail be­
ginning on page 617—is that you can match downloaded transactions to any 
transaction in your company file without leaving the Bank Feeds Center. For 
example, you can match a downloaded deposit to an open invoice or a paid 
invoice where the money is sitting in the Undeposited Funds account (page

614
EXCHANGING 
DATA WITH 
YOUR BANK
657), or simply add the downloaded transaction to QuickBooks. You can also 
add multiple unmatched transactions to your register or delete downloaded 
items that you’ve already taken care of in QuickBooks.
In this mode, the Bank Feeds Center shows your online bank account’s balance 
next to the one from your QuickBooks account. After you download transactions, 
a status area summarizes the work the program has done and what’s still left to 
do. For example, you can see how many transactions QuickBooks matched au­
tomatically, how many need your review, and how many you added or changed.
 NOTE 	 If you use multiple currencies, Express mode displays only payees and accounts based in U.S. dollars. 
To see all payees and accounts, use Classic mode instead.
Express mode also automatically creates renaming rules (page 627) to rename 
the often-inscrutable names that banks give payees. These rules are more 
flexible than the aliases that Classic mode sets up. For example, if the payee 
for a downloaded credit card charge shows up as “Conoco #123-63?#^$&*,” 
you can edit a renaming rule so that the Payee field reads, say, “Conoco” or 
simply “Gas.” From then on, QuickBooks replaces “Conoco #123-63?#^$&*” 
with “Conoco” or “Gas.”
 TIP 	 Although you can switch between online banking modes, you’re more likely to pick one mode and stick 
with it. To switch modes, choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Change Bank Feeds Mode. QuickBooks opens the 
Preferences dialog box to the Checking category’s Company Preferences tab, so you can choose the Express Mode 
or Classic Mode option. When you click OK, QuickBooks closes all open windows to switch modes (and doesn’t 
reopen them when it’s done).
• Classic mode. This mode is your only option if you have accounts in currencies 
other than U.S. dollars. It lets you see your full account register when you’re 
matching transactions, which is helpful if QuickBooks doesn’t find a match. You 
can scroll through the register and correct a discrepancy that prevented the 
program from matching a QuickBooks transaction to its downloaded sibling. You 
can also create aliases to rename payees, similar to Express mode’s renaming 
rules. Classic mode is covered starting on page 626.
 NOTE 	 Classic mode doesn’t recognize renaming rules you’ve created in Express mode, nor does Express 
mode recognize the aliases you created in Classic mode.
Downloading Statements with Web Connect
If your bank communicates via Web Connect (page 613), you can download a file 
of your transactions and import it into QuickBooks. The easiest way to do that is to 
use your web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) to log into your financial 
institution’s website directly. On the website, click the button that creates a file of 
your transactions, which may be labeled something like “Download to QuickBooks.” 

Chapter 24: Banking Online with QuickBooks
615
EXCHANGING 
DATA WITH 
YOUR BANK
Then you can import that file into QuickBooks to load the recent transactions into 
your company file; simply choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Import Web Connect File.
 NOTE 	 You can also access your bank’s website from within QuickBooks. In the Bank Feeds Center, choose 
the financial institution to connect to, and then click the Download Transactions button (if you’re in Classic mode, 
its label reads “Send/Receive” instead). A QuickBooks browser window opens and displays your bank’s website; 
use your customer ID and PIN or password to log in.
Creating Online Items for Direct Connections
Banks that use direct connections can do more than those that use Web Connect. 
Depending on which services your bank provides, you can do some or all of the 
following tasks online:
• Receive transactions that cleared in your account
• Pay bills
• Exchange messages with your bank
• Transfer funds between accounts
You don’t have to take any action to receive transactions from your accounts. Every 
time you open the Bank Feeds window, QuickBooks automatically sets up a request 
for cleared transactions from your bank accounts. This section describes what you 
have to do in QuickBooks to set up electronic bill payments, messages you want to 
send to your bank, and online transfers between accounts.
If you use Express mode, in the Bank Feeds window’s “Send items to your bank” 
section, the Create New button comes with a drop-down list that lets you create 
online transactions for the online services you’ve signed up for with your financial 
institution or Intuit (Figure 24-2). If you use Classic mode, online items appear in 
the Items To Send section of the Bank Feeds window.
PAYING BILLS ONLINE
Whether you use the bill-paying service that your bank provides or subscribe to 
QuickBooks Bill Pay, you don’t have to use any special dialog boxes or windows to 
make electronic payments. However, changing the payment method in a transac­
tion works only when the bank account associated with payments is activated for 
online bill payment. Here’s how to turn the three ways you make payments into 
electronic transactions:
• Pay Bills. In the Pay Bills window (page 195), in the Method drop-down list, 
choose Online Bank Pmt.
• Write Checks. In the Write Checks window’s Main tab (page 203), turn on the 
Pay Online checkbox (which appears only if the multiple currency preference 
is turned off [page 656]).

FIGURE 24-2
If you use Express mode 
and you’ve signed up for 
the corresponding online 
service with your bank 
or Intuit, you can create 
online transactions and 
messages by heading to 
the Bank Feeds window’s 
“Send items to your bank” 
section, clicking the Create 
New button, and then 
choosing an entry like On-
line Checks, Pay Bills, and 
so on. (You can also create 
online transactions in the 
corresponding transaction 
windows, as described in 
the following sections.) 
If you use Classic mode, 
you create these items in 
the corresponding transac-
tion windows instead.
• Account register window. If you “write” checks by entering transactions in your 
checking account’s register window (page 374), you can turn a transaction into 
an online payment by typing Send in the Number cell.
When you set up a payment as an online transaction, QuickBooks adds the payment 
to your list of items to send to your bank. Then, when you open the Bank Feeds 
window, you’ll see these payments in the “Send items to your bank” section (or, if 
you’re using Classic mode, the Items To Send section).
When you tell QuickBooks to send transactions (page 617), it sends these electronic 
payments along with any of your other requests. Once the bill-payment service 
receives your online payment info, it transfers money from your account to the 
vendor’s account—providing that the vendor accepts electronic payments. Other­
wise, the bill-payment service generates a paper check and mails it to the vendor.
SENDING A MESSAGE TO YOUR BANK
If you have an email address for your bank, you can always send messages to it by 
using your regular email program. (Most bank websites also include a link to send 
a message to the bank.) But if your bank can send messages through QuickBooks, 

Chapter 24: Banking Online with QuickBooks
617
BANKING 
ONLINE USING 
EXPRESS MODE
those messages show up in the program’s Bank Feeds window. By sending mes­
sages through QuickBooks, you can see all the messages that you’ve exchanged 
(until you decide to delete them).
Choose Banking→Bank Feeds→“Create a Message for your Bank,” and QuickBooks 
opens the Bank Feeds Message window. You shouldn’t have any trouble figuring 
out what to do in the window’s fields:
• In the “Message to” drop-down list, choose the bank you want to send a mes­
sage to. QuickBooks automatically timestamps the message with the current 
date and time and puts your company’s name in the From box.
• In the Subject box, type a short but informative blurb.
• If you have more than one account enabled for online services, in the Regarding 
Account drop-down list, choose the appropriate one.
• In the Message box, type your comment or question.
• If you want to keep a hard copy of the message, click Print before you click 
OK to send it.
TRANSFERRING FUNDS BETWEEN ACCOUNTS
If you have two accounts at the same financial institution and they’re both set up for 
online banking, you can set up online funds transfers between them in QuickBooks. 
To get started, choose Banking→Transfer Funds as you would for a non-electronic 
transfer (page 388). But in the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window, in addition 
to filling in the fields, be sure to turn on the Online Funds Transfer checkbox. When you 
save the transaction, QuickBooks adds the transfer as an item to send to your bank.
 NOTE 	 Online funds transfers using QuickBooks work only with two bank-feed-enabled accounts at the same 
bank. In other words, you can’t transfer funds electronically using QuickBooks if the accounts are at different 
financial institutions or if you’ve set up a bank feed for one of the accounts at your bank but not the other.
Banking Online Using Express Mode
Express mode makes it easy to see what’s going on with your accounts. You can see 
online balances, downloaded transactions, and the work you have to do to match 
them to transactions in your company file. You can do everything you need to do 
to match downloaded transactions to the ones in QuickBooks without leaving the 
Bank Feeds window.
Sending and Receiving Transactions
Every time you go online, QuickBooks automatically requests newly cleared trans­
actions from your financial institution. If you’ve set up items to send to your bank, 
connecting to it pushes those along, too. Here’s what you do to send requests and 
receive replies in Express mode:

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

EXPRESS MODE
1.	 Choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Bank Feeds Center.
The Bank Feeds window opens.
2.	 If you have bank feeds set up with more than one bank (say, a checking ac­
count at one bank and a credit card at another), in the account list on the 
Bank Feeds window’s left, click the one you want to connect to.
As Figure 24-3 shows, the window displays your balance according to your 
financial institution as of the last update and the balance in the corresponding 
QuickBooks account. The “Last update” label shows how recently you synchro­
nized the QuickBooks account with your online account.
If you have any items to send to your bank (like messages you’ve written or 
online transfers you’ve created, as described on page 615), they appear in the 
“Send items to your bank” section. QuickBooks selects all the requests you’ve 
set up to send to your bank.
FIGURE 24-3
In Express mode, your online 
accounts and balances 
appear on the Bank Feeds 
window’s left. When you 
click an account in that list, 
the bank feed info for that 
account (online balance, 
QuickBooks balance, the 
number of transactions that 
need your attention, and so 
on) appear on the window’s 
right. 
To download transac-
tions, click the Download 
Transactions button (not 
shown). Once you do that, 
the button’s label changes 
to Transaction List, as shown 
here. Click it to see the 
transactions you’ve down-
loaded. To read messages 
from your bank, click the 
Messages Received link.
3.	 If you want to edit or delete any items in the “Send items to your bank” sec­
tion, do that now—before you go online. Once you’re connected, it’s too late.
To edit an item like a funds transfer or bill payment you’re sending, select the 
item, and then click Edit. Make your changes, and then click OK. To remove an 
item like a funds transfer you no longer need, select it and then click Delete.

4.	 When the items you want to send are ready, click the Download Transac­
tions button.
If you downloaded transactions previously and haven’t processed them yet, 
the button’s label reads “Transaction List” instead (as shown in Figure 24-3). 
If that’s the case, you can synchronize the account by clicking the Synchronize 
button’s down arrow (it’s at the window’s top right and its icon looks like two 
arrows pointing in opposite directions), and then choosing “Sync this account” 
or “Sync all for this bank.”
You may briefly see an Update Branding Files message box while QuickBooks 
and your financial institution talk to each other.
5.	 In the “Access to [institution name]” dialog box that appears, type your 
password or PIN, and then click OK.
You enter this info so QuickBooks can communicate with your financial institu­
tion. While they’re communicating, the word “Updating” appears at the top right 
of the Bank Feeds window. In addition, the Download Transactions button’s 
label changes to “Downloading.” When the two are done talking, the Online 
Transmission Summary dialog box tells you how many accounts it updated and 
how many transactions it downloaded.
6.	 In the Online Transmission Summary dialog box, click Close.
The Account Information section shows the balances of your online accounts 
and the number of items QuickBooks received, as shown in Figure 24-3.
Matching Transactions
Every time you connect to your financial institution, QuickBooks downloads all 
the transactions that have cleared since the last time you went online. This section 
describes how to match downloaded transactions using Express mode.
 NOTE 	 The first time you download transactions from an online account, QuickBooks looks at cleared and 
uncleared transactions in your account register. For all subsequent downloads, the program tries to match only 
transactions that haven’t already cleared.
After you send and receive transactions (as described in the previous section), the 
number of transactions that QuickBooks retrieved appears to the left of the Trans­
action List button, as shown in Figure 24-3. Here’s how you process the items that 
QuickBooks received:
1.	 In the Bank Feeds window, click the Transaction List button.
QuickBooks opens the Transactions List window (Figure 24-4) and tries to 
match the downloaded transactions to the ones you’ve already entered in the 
program. After QuickBooks completes its matchmaking, the status bar at the 
top of the window labeled “Auto” shows how many transactions the program 
matched on its own. The status bar labeled “Need Your Review” shows how 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

BANKING

EXPRESS MODE
many transactions you have to help it with. In the transaction table, the status 
of matched transactions is set to Auto, as shown in Figure 24-4, and you don’t 
have to do anything to them; QuickBooks automatically marks them as cleared 
in the bank account’s register (page 374).
FIGURE 24-4
The status bars at the top 
of the Transactions List 
window show how many 
transactions QuickBooks 
already matched and 
how many you have to 
help with. To focus on the 
transactions that aren’t 
matched, click the Status 
box, and then choose 
Need Your Review. In the 
table, transactions that 
the program matched 
have a status of Auto, and 
unmatched transactions 
have a status of Rev (short 
for “Need your review”).
 NOTE 	 Depending on what you do with downloaded transactions, you’ll see different bars in the status area. 
For example, if you add info to transactions, the Changed bar appears. And if you create new transactions from 
ones you download, the Add bar appears.
2.	 If you want to filter the transaction list, click the Status button above the 
transaction table, and then choose Need Your Review to look at the transac­
tions QuickBooks couldn’t match. Or click one of the status bars above the 
transaction table to show only those transactions in the table.
Choose “Changed by Rules” instead to see the transactions whose payees 
QuickBooks renamed using renaming rules (page 627). If you want to make 
sure that QuickBooks matched transactions correctly, choose Auto Matched to 
see only the transactions that the program matched.
You can also filter the list by transaction type or date range. For example, to focus 
on deposits, in the Type drop-down list, choose DEP. To see only transactions that 
occurred within a specific time frame, choose dates in the From and To boxes.

Chapter 24: Banking Online with QuickBooks
621
BANKING

EXPRESS MODE
 NOTE 	 For transactions without check numbers, QuickBooks matches a downloaded transaction with the 
oldest transaction of a matching amount. For example, suppose you withdrew $200 from your checking account 
twice last month. When you download a $200 withdrawal transaction, QuickBooks automatically matches it with 
the older of those two transactions.
If QuickBooks matched every transaction, your work is done (if you open the ac­
count’s register [page 374], you’ll see a lightning bolt in the Cleared column for 
every matched transaction). If you’re not so lucky, the next section tells you how to 
handle unmatched transactions.
 NOTE 	 When you reconcile an account (page 389), the mark in the Cleared column changes from a lightning 
bolt to a checkmark for transactions that have been reconciled.
Matching Unmatched Transactions
Unsuccessful attempts to match transactions can happen for several reasons, but 
the source of the problem is almost always a mistake or omission in your Quick­
Books account register. If you forgot to record a transaction in QuickBooks before 
you downloaded transactions, this section tells you how to make everything match 
up. The box on page 625 describes other problems you might encounter and how 
to correct them.
MATCHING DEPOSITS
When you use the Receive Payments window to record check or credit card pay­
ments you receive, you might place the payment in your Undeposited Funds ac­
count and then forget to make the deposit to your bank account using the Make 
Deposits window (page 370). Or you might forget to receive the payment in your 
company file in the first place. No worries. As Figure 24-5 shows, QuickBooks can 
match these deposits to payments in your Undeposited Funds account or even to 
invoices that are still open.
In the Transactions List window, if a downloaded deposit has a status of Rev, you have 
to help the program match it to a transaction in your company file. In QuickBooks, 
there are four ways to handle deposits:
• Payments in the Undeposited Funds account. If you used the Receive Pay­
ments window to record a customer payment and the money is sitting in the 
Undeposited Funds account (page 657), click the unmatched deposit’s Action 
cell, click the down arrow that appears, and then choose Add More Details. In the 
“Transaction Details - Add More Details” dialog box (Figure 24-5, foreground), 
click the Undeposited Funds tab if it isn’t selected. Turn on the checkbox for 
the received payment that corresponds to the deposit, and then click the Add 
to QuickBooks button at the bottom of the dialog box. If you look at your bank 
account register, you’ll see that the deposit now has a lightning bolt in its Cleared 
cell to indicate that it’s matched with a transaction downloaded from your bank.

To match a deposit, in the 
Transactions List window, 
click its Action cell (labeled 
in the background here), 
click its down arrow, 
and then choose Add 
More Details to open the 
dialog box shown in the 
foreground here. 
If you don’t see the 
deposit you want to match 
on the Undeposited Funds 
tab, click the Open Invoices 
tab to look for the invoice 
that goes with the down-
loaded deposit. When you 
record the deposit, Quick-
Books links the invoice and 
payment to show that the 
invoice was paid.
• Deposits for open invoices. If you haven’t recorded a received payment in 
QuickBooks, the money is still tied up in an open invoice, which means it’s sitting 
in the Accounts Receivable account. To match a deposit to an open invoice, in 
the “Transaction Details – Add More Details” dialog box, click the Open Invoices 
tab shown in Figure 24-5, foreground, turn on the checkbox for the invoice that 
corresponds to the deposit, and then click Add to QuickBooks.
• Existing transactions. If the deposit transaction is sitting in your account 
register but QuickBooks didn’t match it with the downloaded transaction, click 
the unmatched deposit’s Action cell, click the down arrow that appears, and 
then choose “Match to Existing Transaction.” In the “Transaction Details - Match 
to Existing Transaction” dialog box’s unmatched transaction table, click the 
transaction that corresponds to the deposit, and then click the Confirm Match 
button at the bottom of the dialog box.

Chapter 24: Banking Online with QuickBooks
623
BANKING

• Other deposits. If you receive some other type of deposit that you haven’t re­
corded in any way in QuickBooks (like an insurance claim refund, say), you can 
record the deposit’s info directly in the Transaction List window’s table. In the 
deposit’s Payee cell, choose the customer or vendor who sent the money, and 
in the Account cell, choose the account to which you want to assign the deposit. 
Then click the deposit’s Action cell, click the down arrow that appears, and then 
choose Quick Add. (If the Rule Creation dialog box appears, click OK to create 
a renaming rule that renames the downloaded payee to the one you typed in 
the Payee cell. To skip the renaming rule, turn off its checkbox, and then click 
OK.) QuickBooks adds the deposit to your account register and, if this is the first 
item you’ve added during this session, the Add status bar appears at the top of 
the Transactions List window. (If you’ve already added other transactions, the 
number displayed in the Add status bar increases by 1.)
 TIP 	 If your deposit represents several checks from several customers, in the “Transaction Details - Add More 
Details” dialog box, you can select more than one open invoice or undeposited funds entry, and add more than 
one item directly in the Deposit List table. Below the Deposit List, the “Difference remaining” value shows the 
discrepancy between the deposit amount and the items you’ve selected. When the difference equals 0.00, you’re 
ready to click Add to QuickBooks.
MATCHING CHECKS AND EXPENSES
When there’s no sign of a check transaction in QuickBooks that matches the one you 
downloaded, you may have forgotten to enter the transaction or created a bill but 
then forgotten to record that you paid it—or someone is stealing from your account.
In the Transactions List window (Figure 24-4), the amount of a check or bill payment 
appears in the Payment column. A value in the No. column tells you the payment 
is a check; if there’s no value in this column, the payment is a bank charge, bank 
transaction, or electronic payment.
Here’s how to match checks and payments in the Transactions List window:
• Checks or charges that aren’t bill payments. These payments include any 
checks you wrote or electronic payments you made without recording a bill 
in QuickBooks, or bank charges like monthly service fees and bounced-check 
charges. To record one of these expenses, in the payment’s Payee cell, choose 
the customer or vendor you paid, and in the Account cell, choose the account to 
which you want to assign the expense. (When you do this, QuickBooks creates a 
rule that automatically renames future transactions with the same Downloaded 
As value to the payee name you selected. See the box on page 627 for the scoop 
on renaming rules.) Then click the payment’s Action cell, click the down arrow 
that appears, and then choose Quick Add. QuickBooks adds the transaction 
to your account register and, if this is the first item you’ve added during this 
session, the Add status bar appears at the top of the Transactions List window. 
(If you’ve already added other transactions, the number displayed in the Add 
status bar increases by 1.)

 TIP 	 If you want to add more information about the transaction, like splitting the amount between several 
accounts or adding a memo, click the payment’s Action cell, click the down arrow that appears, and then choose 
Add More Details. In the “Transaction Details - Add More Details” dialog box (Figure 24-5, foreground), fill in the 
Memo box or choose additional accounts. Then click the Add to QuickBooks button at the bottom of the dialog 
box.
• Bill payments. For downloaded transactions that correspond to QuickBooks 
bill payments, you need to link the payment and the bill so that the bill shows 
up as paid in QuickBooks. If you recorded the bill but not the bill payment in 
QuickBooks (page 194), click the unmatched payment’s Action cell, click the 
down arrow that appears, and then choose “Select Bills to Mark as Paid.” In the 
“Transaction Details - Select Bills to Mark as Paid” dialog box (Figure 24-6), 
choose the vendor in the Vendor drop-down list. Turn on the checkbox for the 
bill that corresponds to the payment, and then click the Add to QuickBooks 
button at the bottom of the dialog box.
FIGURE 24-6
If you wrote one check to 
pay several of a vendor’s 
bills, turn on the check-
boxes for all the bills that 
the check covers. As you 
turn on checkboxes, Quick-
Books updates the “Dif-
ference remaining” value 
to show the discrepancy 
between the downloaded 
transaction’s amount and 
the total of the bills you 
selected. When this value 
equals 0.00, click Add to 
QuickBooks to save the 
match.
• Match an expense manually. If QuickBooks doesn’t match an ATM withdrawal 
or other expense correctly, you can also match payments to an existing trans­
action. Click the unmatched payment’s Action cell, click the down arrow that 
appears, and then choose “Match to Existing Transaction.” In the “Transaction 
Details - Match to Existing Transaction” dialog box that appears, the table shows 
register transactions that haven’t yet been matched. For example, if you have 
two ATM withdrawals, you can pick the one that goes with the downloaded 
transaction and then click Confirm Match.

TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
Why Transactions Don’t Match
If you recorded all your transactions in QuickBooks but your 
downloaded transactions refuse to match up with what’s in 
your company file, small discrepancies are probably to blame. 
For example, with downloaded transactions that include check 
numbers, QuickBooks first looks for a matching check number 
and, if it finds one, only then does it look at the amount. So the 
program considers check transactions matched only if both the 
check number and amount match. If the check already exists in 
QuickBooks, there are two reasons why the program wouldn’t 
be able to match it:
• The check number in your register is wrong. For example, 
if you handwrote several checks at the same time, you 
might have entered them in QuickBooks in a different 
order than the paper checks you wrote out. Open the 
account’s register window (in the Chart of Accounts 
window, double-click the name of the account), and 
then find the transaction and edit its check number. 
QuickBooks might warn you about duplicate check 
numbers, but go ahead and use the updated number. After 
you’ve edited all the check transactions with incorrect 
numbers, you should be back to unique check numbers. 
• The amounts on the checks don’t match. If the amounts 
disagree, first look at the account register to see if you 
typed the amount correctly; if not, fix it.
If transactions from the bank don’t include check numbers, 
QuickBooks scans transactions without check numbers in 
your account register for matching amounts. If it doesn’t find 
a match, you might have forgotten to record the transaction 
in the Pay Bills window (page 195), or the check doesn’t link 
to a bill (page 202).
If you’re sure that a check amount you recorded is correct but 
the downloaded check amount is different, change the amount 
in QuickBooks. (Your bank won’t go back and edit that transac-
tion.) Then contact your bank and work out the discrepancy. 
If the bank was at fault, it will issue a separate transaction to 
correct the error, and you can then download that transaction.
If the amounts for other types of transactions, like ATM with-
drawals or debit card purchases, don’t match or you haven’t 
recorded the transactions in QuickBooks, then the program 
can’t match them.
Adding Multiple Transactions
If you write only a few checks and receive a few payments each month, matching 
each one individually isn’t too painful. But you have better things to do than match 
hundreds of transactions one by one. Happily, as long as you don’t need to match 
downloaded transactions to open transactions in QuickBooks or do anything fancy 
like create splits, you can add several transactions at once.
In the Transactions List window, turn on the checkmark cells for the transactions you 
want to add. Next, click the down arrow to the right of the Batch Actions button, 
and then choose Add/Approve. You can also fill in details for several transactions 
and add them all at once. To do this, simply fill in their Payee and Account cells and 
turn on their checkmark cells. After you do that, click the Batch Actions down arrow, 
and then choose Add/Approve.
Deleting Downloaded Transactions
Say you’ve reconciled your credit card account to your statement. You then go online 
and download transactions only to find that you’ve downloaded transactions you’ve

already reconciled. You don’t have to match the downloaded transactions because 
your account is already matched up with your bank’s records, so you want to delete 
the downloaded transactions. You can do this via the Transactions List window (to 
open it, in the Bank Feeds window, click Transaction List). Here’s how to choose and 
delete transactions one at a time or as a batch:
• Delete individual transactions. To delete a single transaction, click its Action 
cell, click it again to display the drop-down list shown in Figure 24-7, and then 
choose Ignore. In the Confirm Delete message box, click Yes to delete the down­
loaded transaction. If you change your mind and want to keep it, click No instead.
• Delete several transactions. This option is perfect if you want to delete all 
the transactions that you’ve already reconciled. In the transaction table’s first 
column, click the checkmark cells for each transaction you want to delete. Then, 
at the window’s bottom left, click the down arrow to the right of the Batch Ac­
tions button and choose Ignore. In the Confirm Delete message box, click Yes 
to delete the transactions, or click No to keep them.
FIGURE 24-7
To see transactions from a 
specific date range, such 
as that of your previous 
bank statement, choose 
dates in the From and To 
boxes above the transac-
tion table. 
When you do that, 
QuickBooks filters the list 
to show only transactions 
that occurred within those 
dates.
Banking Online Using Classic Mode
The Bank Feeds Center’s Classic mode lets you see your full account register, which 
makes it easy to find a matching transaction that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize. You 
can edit transactions in the register to, for example, correct a typo that prevented 
the program from making a match. This section explains how to handle your online 
banking using Classic mode.

GEM IN THE ROUGH
Renaming Downloaded Payees
One drawback to downloading transactions is the crazy payee 
names that often show up. For example, a gas-station credit 
card charge downloads with the station’s ID number—Conoco 
#00092372918027—or a payment to your favorite office supply 
store appears as Internt PMT Have a Great Day 1429AZ#2. You 
want payee names that make sense, like Gasoline, or that are 
at least consistent, like Office Supply Heaven #121. If you use 
Express mode, QuickBooks’ renaming rules let you replace 
downloaded payee names with something short, sweet, and 
meaningful.
(If you use Classic mode, QuickBooks’ payee aliasing feature 
lets you associate a downloaded payee name with a name in 
your company file, such as a vendor’s or customer’s name. 
However, you can’t define tests, as described in the numbered 
steps below. That means that you can associate only one name 
with a downloaded payee using payee aliases.)
QuickBooks automatically creates renaming rules whenever 
you change the payee name for a downloaded transaction, but 
the renaming rules it creates might not be what you want. For 
example, suppose you want to rename any payees that include 
“Conoco” or “Valero,” or you want to rename a payee only if its 
downloaded name is exactly “Acme Equipment.” Here’s how 
to edit a renaming rule:
1.	 At the top left of the Transactions List window, click Rules.
2.	 In the Action cell for the rule you want to edit, click the 
down arrow to the right of the Select button, and then 
choose Edit Rule on the drop-down menu. 
3.	 In the Edit Rules Details dialog box, in the first drop-down 
list, click the down arrow to the right of the Description 
label, and then choose the test you want to use, like Starts 
With or Matches Exactly.
4.	 In the second box, type the value that appears in all the 
downloaded payee names for that vendor, such as Acme 
Equipment.
5.	 In the second drop-down list, choose either Rename 
or Categorize to change the payee field or the account, 
respectively.
6.	 If you chose Rename, then in the Payee Field To drop-down 
list, choose the payee name you want to use. If you chose 
Categorize, in the “It in the Following Account” drop-down 
list, choose an account.
7.	 Click Save.
To remove an existing renaming rule, click the down arrow to 
the right of the rule’s Select button, and then choose Delete 
Rule.
QuickBooks learns from the renaming and categorizing you do 
in the transaction list and creates renaming rules of its own. 
The rules it creates have names like _AutoGeneratedRule-1.
Sending and Receiving Items
Choose Banking→Bank Feeds→Bank Feeds Center to open the Bank Feeds window. 
In Classic mode, this window is more compact than its Express mode sibling, as you 
can see in Figure 24-8.
To send requests to your bank, click Send/Receive. In the “Access to [your bank]” 
dialog box that appears, type your password or PIN, and then click OK. After you 
send your requests, the Online Transmission Summary dialog box tells you how 
many transactions QuickBooks downloaded from your bank. Click Close, and the 
Items Received From Financial Institution box shows the balances of your online 
accounts and any messages that your bank sent you.

FIGURE 24-8
If you have online services set up 
with more than one bank (your 
checking account at one bank and 
a credit card at another, say), in 
the Financial Institution drop-down 
list, choose one to connect to. In 
the Items To Send box, QuickBooks 
automatically selects all requests 
(like downloading your transac-
tions). If you don’t want to send an 
item, click anywhere in its row to 
uncheck it. Then click Send/Receive 
to connect to the bank’s website 
and send the selected requests.
Working with Online Items
In the Bank Feeds window (Figure 24-8), you can make changes to items you intend 
to send before you connect to your bank account. And after you receive items from 
your bank, you can view items or delete them in the same window. Here’s how you 
use the window’s various buttons:
• Edit. Before you go online in Classic mode, you can edit any items other than 
a request for a statement, like a funds transfer or bill payment you’re sending. 
Simply select the item and then click Edit. Make the changes you want, and 
then click OK.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks adds a request for a statement to the Items To Send list every time you open the Bank 
Feeds window (the request is labeled “Download Bank Data for account: [account name]”—Figure 24-8 shows 
an example). In this context, a statement is simply a list of the transactions that cleared in your account since 
the last time you retrieved information formatted in a way that QuickBooks can import.
• Delete. In Classic mode, the Bank Feeds window includes two Delete buttons, 
one for each of the window’s two main boxes. Simply click the button to the right 
of the appropriate box to delete the items you’ve selected in it. For example, if 
you set up a funds transfer between accounts that you no longer need, in the 
Items To Send box, select the item, and then click the Delete button to its right.

Chapter 24: Banking Online with QuickBooks

BANKING

You’ll find that your bank is fond of sending you messages about new services 
or holidays. There’s no reason to clutter the Items Received From Financial In­
stitution box with these messages, so simply select them and then click Delete.
• View. In the Items Received From Financial Institution box, select an item and 
then click View to see it in its entirety. When you want to match the transac­
tions in a statement to your QuickBooks bank account transactions, select the 
statement and then click View; the next section has more details.
Matching Transactions
Every time you connect to your financial institution (by clicking Send/Receive in 
the Bank Feeds window), QuickBooks requests a statement of all the transactions 
that have cleared since the last time you went online. After you connect, in the 
Items Received From Financial Institution box, you’ll see an entry for the statement 
QuickBooks retrieved. To view the downloaded transactions and pull them into your 
company-file bank account, select this entry and then click View.
When you do, QuickBooks opens the Match Transactions window (Figure 24-9) and 
tries to match the downloaded transactions to the ones you’ve already entered in 
the program. If QuickBooks is able to match transactions, then at the bottom of 
the Match Transactions window, on the Downloaded Transactions tab, the status 
for those transactions is set to Matched and you don’t have to do anything to them; 
QuickBooks automatically marks them as cleared in the register. Transactions that 
the program can’t match have a status of Unmatched, as shown in Figure 24-9.
 NOTE 	 The first time you download transactions from an online account, QuickBooks looks at cleared and 
uncleared transactions in your account register. For all subsequent downloads, the program tries to match only 
transactions that haven’t already cleared.
If QuickBooks matches every transaction, in the account register’s Cleared column, 
you’ll see a lightning bolt for every matched transaction and your work is done. If 
you’re not so lucky, here’s how to deal with the unmatched items:
• Unmatched checks. Select the check that you didn’t enter in QuickBooks and 
then click Add One to Register. In the Add Unmatched Transaction dialog box 
that opens, you can choose one of three options. The program automatically 
selects the “Using the register” option. If you keep this option selected and click 
OK, the Add Unmatched Transaction dialog box closes. If the Name Not Found 
dialog box opens, click Cancel because you don’t want to create a new name 
record in QuickBooks. In that window’s register, you’ll see a new transaction 
with its check number, date, and amount filled in. All you have to do is enter 
the payee and account, and then click Record.

FIGURE 24-9
If you dutifully enter all 
your transactions before 
you download your state-
ment, seeing dozens of 
unmatched transactions 
might make you nervous. 
To make QuickBooks 
compare the downloaded 
transactions with the ones 
in your account register, 
turn on the Show Register 
checkbox near the top of 
this window.
If you select the “As a payment made by check, using the Write Checks window” 
option and then click OK, QuickBooks opens the Write Checks window to a new 
check transaction and fills in the check number, date, and amount. Fill in the 
other fields (page 203), and then click Save & Close. If the Name Not Found 
dialog box opens when you click OK, click Cancel.
If you select the “As a payment for a previously created bill, using the Pay Bills 
window” option and then click OK, QuickBooks opens the Pay Bills window so 
you can select and pay the bill that corresponds to this unmatched transaction.
• Unmatched deposits. In the list of downloaded transactions, select the deposit, 
and then click Add One to Register. Similar to the Add Unmatched Transac­
tion dialog box that opens for an unmatched check, the dialog box that opens 
when you click Add One to Register here contains three options. The program 
automatically selects the “Using the register” option. If you click OK, the Add 
Unmatched Transaction dialog box closes and the program adds the new deposit 
to the Match Transactions window’s register with the date and amount filled in. 
Enter the payee and account, and then click Record.
If you select the “As a deposit, using the Make Deposits window” option and 
then click OK, QuickBooks opens the “Payments to Deposit” window. Select 
the deposit in the list, and then click OK.

Chapter 24: Banking Online with QuickBooks

If you select the “As a payment on an invoice, using the Receive Payments win­
dow” option and then click OK, the Receive Payments window opens so you can 
apply the deposit to the invoice that corresponds to this unmatched deposit.
• Bank charges. For charges including monthly service fees, bounced-check 
charges, and so on, in the list of downloaded transactions, select the transac­
tion, and then click Add One to Register. In the Add Unmatched Transaction 
dialog box that opens, leave the “Using the register” option selected and click 
OK. Back in the Match Transactions window, fill in the transaction’s fields, and 
then click Record.
Adding Multiple Transactions
If you want to add several unmatched transactions to the register, in the Match 
Transactions window, click Add Multiple. The “Add Multiple Transactions to the 
Register” window opens and lists all the unmatched transactions. As you can see 
in Figure 24-10, the top half of the window lists transactions that are either ready to 
go or are missing an account. After you choose accounts for the transactions that 
don’t have them, click Record.
FIGURE 24-10
You can’t do anything with 
the transactions listed at 
the bottom of this window 
that have unrecognized 
payees. To correct those 
transactions, close this 
window and, back in 
the Match Transactions 
window, select a transac-
tion, and then click Add 
One to Register. You can 
then edit the payee name 
in the register. Repeat this 
process to fix the other 
transactions listed in the 
bottom of the window.
Deleting Downloaded Transactions
Classic mode doesn’t give you a way to delete transactions on the Match Transactions 
window’s Downloaded Transactions tab. If you’ve already reconciled your account 
and then downloaded the transactions, you might think you have to live with those 
unmatched transactions forever. But with some fancy footwork, you can get rid of 
those downloaded orphans. Here’s what you do:

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
632
BANKING 
ONLINE USING 
CLASSIC MODE
1.	 At the top of the Match Transactions window, scroll in the register to find 
the reconciled transaction that pairs with an unmatched transaction.
An asterisk in the transaction’s cleared cell (the one in the column whose head­
ing is a checkmark) means that transaction is cleared; a checkmark indicates 
that it’s reconciled.
2.	 Keep clicking its cleared cell until the cell is blank.
As soon as the cleared cell is blank, QuickBooks automatically matches the 
register transaction and the downloaded transaction. You see a lightning bolt 
in the cleared cell to indicate the match, and the downloaded transaction disap­
pears from the Downloaded Transactions tab.
3.	 Click the cleared cell again until you see a checkmark.
The register transaction is back to being reconciled, and the downloaded 
transaction is gone forever.
 TIP 	 If you have dozens of transactions that you want to delete and the account doesn’t use a foreign currency, 
switch to Express mode instead (see the Tip on page 614). Then you can delete the transactions in the Transactions 
List window as described on page 626. After that, you can switch back to Classic mode.

CHAPTER
25
A
n organization’s approach to accounting often depends on the type of busi­
ness it is and its objectives, policies, procedures, and industry. For example, 
maybe you use inventory tracking and payroll—but maybe you don’t. The 
way you and your accountant like to work also influences your organization’s ac­
counting practices. For instance, you might prefer the simplicity of cash accounting 
to the more intimate pairing of income and expenses that accrual accounting offers 
(see page xxii).
Enter QuickBooks, which has the Herculean task of satisfying every nuance of busi­
ness operation and personal proclivity. The program’s preferences are configurable 
settings that accommodate different business approaches and personal tastes. 
During installation, QuickBooks picks the settings likely to work for a majority of 
organizations. And if you used the QuickBooks Setup feature (page 9) to set up 
your company file, you might already have most preferences set the way you want.
You can change the program’s preferences for each company file to match the way 
you work, such as whether you create estimates for jobs you go after and how you 
calculate the amount of inventory that’s available. Preferences also let you turn on 
various QuickBooks features, such as estimates, sales tax, inventory, and payroll. Us­
ing QuickBooks for a while can make it clear which preferences you need to change. 
This chapter presents all the program’s preferences and helps you determine which 
settings are appropriate for you and your organization.
 NOTE 	 You can toggle most preferences at any time, but you can’t turn some preferences off once you turn 
them on, such as the multiple currencies preference. Before you change any preferences, back up your company 
file. Then feel free to tweak and tinker with your preferences.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

PREFERENCES: 
THE BASICS
Preferences: The Basics
You can’t complain that QuickBooks doesn’t offer enough preference settings—the 
program gives you 23 categories of preferences that control the program’s behavior. 
Each category has several settings, so finding the ones that do what you want is the 
biggest challenge. To view and set preferences, open the Preferences dialog box by 
choosing Edit→Preferences.
On the left side of the dialog box is a pane that lists each preference category, as 
shown in Figure 25-1. To display the settings within a category, click the appropri­
ate entry in this pane. QuickBooks highlights the icon you click to indicate that it’s 
selected.
FIGURE 25-1
The first time you open 
the Preferences dialog 
box, QuickBooks displays 
the General preference 
category, as shown here. 
(The categories are listed 
alphabetically, not in order 
of importance.)
On subsequent visits to 
this dialog box, Quick-
Books selects the last 
category you chose during 
your previous visit.
 TIP 	 On the right side of the Preferences dialog box, the Also See list identifies other preference categories 
that affect the one you’re currently viewing.
To accommodate both company-wide and personal preferences, QuickBooks in­
cludes two tabs for each category:
• My Preferences. As you might expect, this tab contains options that people who 
log into QuickBooks can set for their QuickBooks sessions alone. For example, 
in the Desktop View category, you can choose options to determine whether 
you see multiple windows and whether QuickBooks saves the desktop when 
you close the company file—without forcing your tastes on everyone else.
• Company Preferences. Some preferences have to remain consistent for ev­
eryone in an organization. For example, the IRS won’t tolerate some financial 

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
635
ACCOUNTING
reports produced using cash accounting and others using accrual accounting 
(see page xxii for the pros and cons of each method). The settings on this tab 
ensure consistency because they apply to everyone who logs into your company 
file. To make sure company preferences are set properly, only folks who log in 
as QuickBooks administrators (page 718) can change the settings on this tab.
 NOTE 	 If you’re puzzled by QuickBooks’ habit of opening the Preferences dialog box to a My Preferences 
tab that has no preferences, rest assured that Intuit has its reasons. Because only QuickBooks administrators can 
change settings on the Company Preferences tab, QuickBooks displays the My Preferences tab to avoid taunting 
the majority of people who log into the company file by showing them preferences they can’t modify.
When you click OK to close the Preferences dialog box, QuickBooks saves the 
changes you made in the current category. But what if you’re on an energetic mis­
sion to reset preferences in several categories? If you change preferences in one 
category and then click the icon for another category, QuickBooks asks you whether 
you want to save the changes in the category you’re about to leave. Make sure you 
save what you want by selecting one of the following options:
• Click Yes to save the changes in the current category before switching to the 
category whose icon you clicked.
• Click No to discard your changes and move on to the category whose icon you 
clicked.
• Click Cancel to discard your changes and remain in the current category so 
you can make other choices.
The rest of this chapter explains each category of preferences. They’re listed here 
in alphabetical order, just as they are in the Preferences dialog box. You’ll also find 
preferences mentioned throughout this book where they apply to specific book­
keeping tasks.
Accounting
These preferences control key accounting practices, such as requiring that accounts 
be assigned to transactions and closing the books at the end of a fiscal year. Ac­
counting practices stay the same throughout a company, so the preferences in this 
category all reside on the Company Preferences tab. Here’s what they do:
 NOTE 	 In QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise, the My Preferences tab has one preference: the “Autofill memo 
in general journal entry” checkbox. Leave this setting turned on if you want QuickBooks to copy the memo you 
enter in the first line of a journal entry to every subsequent line of the entry.
• Use account numbers. If you follow a numbering standard for your accounts 
(page 53 shows a common one), turn on this checkbox so you can assign a 
number, in addition to a name, to each account you create.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
636
ACCOUNTING
 TIP 	 When you assign an account to a transaction—such as applying your rent check to the Rent expense 
account—you can locate the account in the Account drop-down list by typing either its number or the first few 
letters of its name.
• Require accounts. If remembering details isn’t your strong suit, keeping this 
checkbox turned on forces you to assign an account to every item and transac­
tion you create, which, in turn, creates a trail that you, your accountant, and the 
IRS can follow. With this checkbox turned on, when you click Record without an 
assigned account, QuickBooks informs you that you have to enter an account. To 
record the transaction, in the Warning message box, click OK, and then choose 
the account in the transaction’s Account field. After that, when you click Record 
again, QuickBooks completes the transaction.
If you turn this checkbox off and record transactions without assigned accounts, 
QuickBooks assigns the transaction amounts to either the Uncategorized Income 
or Uncategorized Expense account. For example, if you receive a payment from 
a customer and don’t assign an account to the deposit, that income posts to 
the Uncategorized Income account.
 WARNING 	 If the IRS decides to audit your tax returns, you’ll have to go back and move your uncategorized 
income and expenses into the right accounts to prove that you paid the right amount of taxes. And, if you hap­
pened to pay too little, the IRS will charge you penalties and interest.
• Show lowest subaccount only. If you use only top-level accounts in your chart 
of accounts, you have no need for this behavior. And if you don’t use account 
numbers, this checkbox is grayed out. But if your chart of accounts is a hierar­
chy of accounts and subaccounts, as described in the box on page 60, turn on 
this checkbox so Account fields show only the subaccount’s number and name 
instead of the full account path from the top-level account to the lowest subac­
count. Figure 3-4 on page 60 shows examples of both behaviors.
• Use class tracking for transactions. If you want to track your business in more 
ways than accounts, items, customer types, and job types can offer, you can use 
classes (page 140) to add another type of categorization to your reports. For 
example, you can create classes to track business units’ income and expenses, 
regardless of which types of customers they support or the type of work they 
do. To activate the class tracking feature, turn on this checkbox, which adds a 
Class field to every transaction window.
—
— Prompt to assign classes. If you turn on class tracking, you should assign 
classes to all your class-related transactions; if you don’t, reports organized 
by class won’t accurately reflect your business performance. Turn on this 
checkbox so that QuickBooks reminds you when you forget to assign a 
class to a transaction.
• Automatically assign general journal entry number. Journal entries get their 
name from the traditional approach to accounting, in which accountants assign 

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
637
ACCOUNTING
credits and debits to accounts in paper-based journals. There’s no reason to turn 
this checkbox off. With it on, QuickBooks makes sure that each journal entry 
has a unique number, as shown in Figure 25-2. When you create a new journal 
entry, QuickBooks increments the previous journal entry number by one, which 
makes it easier for you and your accountant to refer to the correct journal entries.
FIGURE 25-2
QuickBooks follows your 
lead in numbering journal 
entries. When you create 
your first journal entry, 
you can type a code in the 
Entry No. box, such as your 
initials and a sequence 
number (TRB-1, for 
example). As you create 
additional journal entries, 
QuickBooks increments 
the code to TRB-2, TRB-3, 
and so on.
 NOTE 	 If the previous journal entry’s Entry No. box is blank, QuickBooks won’t automatically assign a number 
to the next journal entry. So if you notice that QuickBooks has begun to shirk its automatic numbering duties, 
look for a journal entry with a blank Entry No. field and add numbers to any existing journal entries that don’t 
have them. After that, when you add a new journal entry, QuickBooks will number it correctly.
• Warn when posting a transaction to Retained Earnings. QuickBooks automati­
cally turns on this checkbox, and it’s a good idea to leave it on. The program 
creates a Retained Earnings account to track past profits that you’ve retained 
in the company’s coffers. For example, if your company earned $50,000 in 2015 
and didn’t distribute that money to the owners or as profit-sharing bonuses to 
employees, the money becomes Retained Earnings once your fiscal year 2016 
begins. QuickBooks automatically updates the balance in the account at the 
beginning of a new fiscal year by transferring the previous year’s net profit 
into it. With this preference turned on, QuickBooks warns you when you try to 
post a transfer directly to the Retained Earning account, which would create 
inaccurate records. (See the box on page 454 to learn how to differentiate your 
most recent year’s retained earnings from earlier retained earnings.)
• Date warnings. If your books are up to date, then dates far in the past or future 
are usually mistakes. To receive warnings for dates like those, leave the “Warn 
if transactions are _ day(s) in the past” and “Warn if transactions are _ day(s) 
in the future” checkboxes turned on. The boxes are initially set to 90 for past 
dates and 30 for future dates, but you can change them.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
638
BILLS
• Closing date. After producing the financial reports for a fiscal year and paying 
corporate income taxes, most companies close their books, which means lock­
ing that fiscal year’s transactions so no one can change anything. By closing 
the books, you ensure that your past transactions continue to match what you 
submitted to your accountant, reported to the IRS, and communicated to your 
shareholders.
When you use QuickBooks, your QuickBooks company file is synonymous with 
your “books.” Therefore, you close your books by clicking Set Date/Password 
here, and then adjust the following settings in the “Set Closing Date and Pass­
word” dialog box:
—
— Exclude estimates, sales orders, and purchase orders from closing date 
restrictions. Estimates, sales orders, and purchase orders are non-posting 
transactions—they don’t affect your account balances, so they don’t af­
fect the financial reports you generate. Initially, this setting is turned off 
so QuickBooks warns you when you edit those types of transactions if 
they’re dated before the closing date. To turn off the warnings, simply turn 
on this checkbox.
—
— Closing Date. Pick the appropriate date here. For example, if you run your 
company on a calendar year and just reported and paid taxes for 2015, 
type or choose 12/31/2015.
—
— Password. You can assign a password so that you can edit, delete, or create 
transactions that alter account balances in closed books. To do so, type the 
password in the Closing Date Password and Confirm Password boxes, and 
then click OK. That way, if you have to edit a transaction prior to the closing 
date, you’ll first have to type the password to tell QuickBooks you mean it.
Bills
This category lets you specify how you want to handle bills that vendors send you. 
The My Preferences tab is empty, so these settings all appear on the Company 
Preferences tab:
• Bills are due _ days after receipt. Initially, QuickBooks sets this preference 
so that bills you enter show a due date 10 days after the date of the bill. (For 
instance, if you receive a bill dated June 15 and you enter that date in the Enter 
Bills window’s Date field, QuickBooks automatically changes the Bill Due field 
to June 25.) This value is fine in most cases. If a bill arrives that’s due in a dif­
ferent number of days, you can simply change its due date in the Enter Bills 
window’s Bill Due field.
 NOTE 	 If you assign terms to your vendors (page 84), then when you choose a vendor in the Enter Bills 
window, the program calculates the bill’s due date based on the bill’s Date field and those terms rather than 
using the “Bills are due _ days after receipt” value.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
639
CHECKING
• Warn about duplicate bill numbers from same vendor. Surely you don’t 
want to pay the same bill twice, so be sure to leave this checkbox turned on so 
QuickBooks warns you that you’re entering a bill with the same number as one 
you already entered from the same vendor.
• Paying bills. If you want QuickBooks to automatically apply to your bills any 
credits and discounts to which you’re entitled, turn on the “Automatically use 
credits” and “Automatically use discounts” checkboxes. For example, if you’ve 
earned an early payment discount and also have a $100 credit, QuickBooks 
applies these adjustments to your bill before calculating the total. If you turn 
on the “Automatically use discounts” checkbox, then in the Default Discount 
Account drop-down list, choose the account to which you post the discounts 
you take, such as an expense account specifically for vendor discounts.
Calendar
QuickBooks’ Calendar window (page 486) shows you when transactions and to-
dos are due, so you can be sure to perform the tasks you’re supposed to, such as 
paying bills and following up on open invoices. Calendar preferences are all on the 
My Preferences tab, so that each person who works in the company file can choose 
what he sees:
• Calendar settings. The preferences in this section control the calendar’s ap­
pearance. You can see one day, one week, or one month at a time. If you choose 
“Remember last view” in the “Calendar view” drop-down list, QuickBooks opens 
the calendar to the last duration you selected. For the weekly view, you can 
specify whether you want to see Monday through Friday or the entire week. 
Initially, the Show preference is set to All Transactions, but you can change it 
to Transactions Due or To Do, or choose a specific type of transaction, such as 
Invoice, Received Payment, or Bill.
• Upcoming & past due settings. On the right side of the Calendar window is a 
pane that lists to-dos and transactions that are coming up or overdue. You can 
use the Display drop-down menu here to tell QuickBooks to show or hide this 
pane, or better yet, show the pane only if there are upcoming or past-due items. 
Initially, the Calendar window shows what’s coming up in the next 7 days and 
what was due in the past 60 days. You can change the period in the future to 
up to 31 days, while the past-due period can shrink to as few as 14 days.
Checking
Checking preferences let you adjust company-wide settings to control the appear­
ance of the checks your company prints through QuickBooks. On the My Preferences 
tab for this category (Figure 25-3), you can tell QuickBooks which accounts to select 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

CHECKING
automatically for several types of financial transactions. This section explains your 
options.
FIGURE 25-3
When you choose accounts 
here, you have one less 
field to fill in for each 
banking transaction. For 
example, if you always 
deposit money into your 
money market account, 
you can adjust these set-
tings so the Write Checks 
window selects your 
checking account, whereas 
the Make Deposits window 
selects your money market 
account.
Choosing the Bank Accounts You Use
If you have only one bank account, you can ignore the preferences for default 
accounts and QuickBooks will automatically choose your bank account for writ­
ing checks, paying bills, paying sales tax, and making deposits. But suppose your 
company has stores in several states and each store has its own checking account. 
Because these options are on the My Preferences tab, each person who logs into 
QuickBooks can choose her store’s bank accounts for financial transactions. For 
example, the person in Miami wants the Florida checking account to appear in the 
Write Checks window, but the person in New York wants to see the Manhattan 
checking account. To save some time (and to prevent folks from selecting the wrong 
account in a drop-down list), set your accounts according to the following guidelines:
• Open the Write Checks form with _ account. In this drop-down list, choose 
the account you typically use to write checks. That way, when you open the 
Write Checks window, QuickBooks automatically fills in the Bank Account field 
with the account you specify here.
• Open the Pay Bills form with _ account. For this preference, choose the ac­
count you typically use to pay bills, which is often the same checking account 
that you chose in the “Open the Write Checks form with” preference. When you 
open the Pay Bills window, QuickBooks automatically fills in the Account field 
at the bottom right of the window with the account you specify here.
• Open the Pay Sales Tax form with _ account. If you collect sales tax from 
your customers (see Chapter 21), you have to remit the taxes you collect to 
the appropriate tax authority, such as the state where your business is located. 
When it’s time to send the taxes in, you open the Pay Sales Tax dialog box and 

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
641
CHECKING
create a payment. This preference sets the account that QuickBooks uses in 
that dialog box’s Pay From Account field.
• Open the Make Deposits form with _ account. Unlike the other options on 
the My Preferences tab, this preference sets up the account you typically use 
when you deposit money. For many small businesses, the deposit account and 
checking account are one and the same. But some businesses deposit money 
into an account that pays interest and then transfer money into a checking ac­
count only when it’s time to pay bills. After you choose the account you use to 
deposit money, QuickBooks automatically puts it in the Make Deposits window’s 
Deposit To field.
Settings for Company Checks
Although a company might have several checking accounts, QuickBooks assumes 
that company checks should look the same no matter who prints them. Most prefer­
ences on the Checking category’s Company Preferences tab let you set the company 
standard for printing checks from QuickBooks. (If you use preprinted checks and 
write them out by hand, you can skip some of these options.) Here’s what these 
preferences do:
• Print account names on voucher. If the checks you print include check stubs, 
you might as well turn on this checkbox so QuickBooks prints the name of the 
account you used to pay the check on the stub. If you use only one bank ac­
count, printing the account name might not seem all that useful. But with this 
preference turned on, QuickBooks also prints the Payroll item on the stub for 
payroll checks and, on checks used to purchase inventory, it prints the name 
of the inventory item you purchased—both of which can help you keep track 
of where your money is going.
 NOTE 	 Regardless of how you set the “Print account names on voucher” preference, QuickBooks always 
prints the payee, date, memo, amount, and total amount on check stubs.
• Change check date when non-cleared check is printed. When you turn on this 
checkbox, QuickBooks inserts the date that you print checks as the check date, 
which is just fine in most situations. You can then enter checks into QuickBooks 
over several days but date all the checks with the day you print them. Leave 
this checkbox turned off if you want to control the check dates—for example, to 
defer payments for a few days by post-dating checks with the date the payees 
receive them.
• Start with payee field on check. If you always write checks from the same ac­
count, or you use the “Open the Write Checks form with” preference to specify 
an account (page 640), pressing Tab in the Write Checks window to skip the 
Bank Account field for each check transaction gets old quickly. When you turn 
on this checkbox, you can save one pesky keystroke each time you write a check. 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
642
CHECKING
Turning on this preference also makes it so that the Enter Credit Card Charges 
window opens with the cursor in the Purchased From box.
• Warn about duplicate check numbers. Not surprisingly, when this checkbox 
is turned on, QuickBooks warns you if you’re trying to record a check with the 
same number as one you already entered.
• Autofill payee account number in check memo. Just as you assign account 
numbers to your customers, the vendors you do business with assign your 
company an account number, too. Printing account numbers on the checks you 
write helps vendors credit your account, even if the check gets separated from 
its accompanying payment slip. If you enter your company’s account number 
in each vendor record in QuickBooks (page 84), be sure to leave this checkbox 
on to print these account numbers on your checks.
Choosing Company-Wide Payroll Accounts
If you don’t use QuickBooks’ payroll features, don’t bother with these preferences. If 
you do use Intuit Payroll Services (page 415), the two settings in the Select Default 
Accounts To Use section of the Company Preferences tab let you set the accounts 
you use for payroll. (These settings are on the Company Preferences tab because 
most companies centralize payroll no matter how regional other operations are.) 
Here are your options:
• Open the Create Paychecks form with _ account. In this drop-down list, choose 
the account you use to write payroll checks. If you use QuickBooks payroll, then 
when you open the Create Paychecks window, the program automatically fills 
in the Bank Account field with the account you specify here.
• Open the Pay Payroll Liabilities form with _ account. In this drop-down list, 
choose the account you use to pay payroll taxes.
 TIP 	 Using a separate bank account for payroll simplifies reconciling your regular checking account, particularly 
if your company has numerous employees and weekly paychecks. Otherwise, you’ll have to reconcile dozens or 
even hundreds of paychecks each month in addition to the other checks you write.
Selecting a Bank Feeds Mode
QuickBooks lets you choose between two versions of the Bank Feeds Center: Express 
mode is more flexible and powerful than Classic mode, but you can switch between 
the two modes anytime by selecting an option in this section of the Checking cat­
egory’s Company Preferences tab. Page 613 explains the two modes in detail.
If you select the Express Mode option, you can tell QuickBooks to create renaming 
rules for the transactions you download. The “Create rules automatically” checkbox 
is turned on initially, which means that the program sets up a new renaming rule 
each time you edit a downloaded transaction’s payee. That way, the next time you 
download a transaction from that payee, the program automatically fills in the edited 
name. If you turn this checkbox off, QuickBooks doesn’t create renaming rules for 

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
643
DESKTOP VIEW
you. The “Always ask before creating a rule” checkbox is also turned on initially, which 
means that, when you edit a downloaded transaction’s payee name and approve the 
transaction, the Rule Creation dialog box opens. (To save the rule that QuickBooks 
created, click OK in the dialog box; to discard it, click Don’t Create Any Rules.)
If you select the Classic Mode option, payee aliasing (which is similar, though not 
identical, to renaming rules) options appear. The On radio button is initially selected. 
Page 627 explains the differences between Express mode’s renaming rules and 
Classic mode’s payee aliasing. To turn off payee aliasing, select the Off radio button.
Desktop View
Each person can customize her own QuickBooks desktop with the settings on this 
category’s My Preferences tab—these choices don’t affect anybody else who logs 
into QuickBooks. On the other hand, the Company Preferences tab includes prefer­
ences that control what appears on the QuickBooks Home Page for everyone who 
uses this company file. This section explains your options.
Window Preferences
With the settings on the My Preferences tab, you can tell QuickBooks to keep your 
desktop neat with only one window at a time, or you can view multiple windows:
• One Window. If you’re not good at multitasking or you prefer full-size windows, 
choose this option so that QuickBooks displays only one full-size window at a 
time. You can still open multiple windows, but QuickBooks stacks them on top 
of one another so you see only the top one. With this approach, you can switch 
windows by choosing them in the Open Window List (to display it, choose 
View→Open Window List or, in the left icon bar’s middle section, choose Open 
Windows) or, on the program’s main menu bar, choosing Window and then 
selecting the name of the window you want to display.
• Multiple Windows. If you like to view several windows at once or want to size 
windows based on how much information they display, as shown in Figure 
25-4, choose this option. When you do, the Window menu includes items for 
arranging windows, such as Cascade and Tile Vertically.
 NOTE 	 You can also switch between one and multiple windows by choosing View→One Window or 
View→Multiple Windows.

FIGURE 25-4
The Multiple Windows 
option displays several 
windows at the same time.
In this mode, you can click 
a window to bring it to 
the front, reposition it by 
dragging its title bar, or 
resize it by dragging its 
edges and corners.
Preferences for Saving the Desktop
The My Preferences tab in the Desktop View category includes four choices for what 
QuickBooks does with the windows that are open when you exit the program. For 
example, if you have the windows arranged just the way you like, you can save your 
QuickBooks desktop so the windows open in exactly the same arrangement the next 
time you log in. You can also choose when to display the Home Page and whether 
to use colored or gray icons in the top icon bar. Here’s the lowdown on the options 
in the My Preferences tab’s Desktop section:
• Save when closing company. If you typically continue bookkeeping tasks from 
one QuickBooks session to the next, this option saves the open windows and 
their positions when you exit the program. The next time you log in, QuickBooks 
opens the same windows and puts them where they were last time so you can 
finish entering the remaining 300 checks you have to write.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
645
DESKTOP VIEW
• Save current desktop. If you have a favorite arrangement of windows that works 
well for the bulk of your efforts in QuickBooks, you can save that arrangement 
and display it every time you log in. To do so, first open the windows you want 
and position them. Next, open the Preferences dialog box, choose this option, 
and then click OK. From then on, the next time you open the Preferences dialog 
box, QuickBooks adds the “Keep previously saved desktop” option (explained 
below) to the My Preferences tab.
• Don’t save the desktop. Choosing this option displays a desktop with only 
the menu bar, the icon bar, and the Home Page. This makes QuickBooks open 
faster, and the menu bar, icon bars, and Home Page give you fast access to the 
windows and dialog boxes you use regularly.
• Keep previously saved desktop. Once you’ve saved a desktop you like, this 
option appears on the My Preferences tab of the Desktop View category. In fact, 
once you choose “Save current desktop” and click OK to close the Preferences 
dialog box, QuickBooks automatically selects this option the next time you open 
the dialog box. With this option selected, QuickBooks opens with the desktop as 
it was when you selected “Save current desktop,” regardless of which windows 
you’ve opened since then or how you’ve arranged them. If you want to save a 
new desktop arrangement, position your windows how you want them, select 
“Save current desktop,” and then click OK.
• Show Home page when opening a company file. QuickBooks’ Home Page 
shows the entire workflow of your accounting tasks, as well as links to oft-
opened windows like the Chart of Accounts. Keep this checkbox turned on to 
see the Home Page each time you log in. If you turn this checkbox off, the Home 
Page appears only if it’s open when you save your desktop or if you open it by 
choosing Company→Home Page.
 TIP 	 In QuickBooks 2015, the Home Page window sports two tabs: Home Page and Insights (page 44). Regard­
less of whether you tell QuickBooks to display the Home Page window or it appears automatically when you open 
your company file, you see the tab that was visible when you closed your previous session.
• Switch to colored icons/light background on the Top Icon Bar. If you use the 
top icon bar (page 30), its out-of-the-box color scheme is blue-and-gray icons 
on a dark-blue background. If you turn on this checkbox, that changes to blue, 
green, and yellow icons on a light-gray background, as shown in Figure 25-5 (if 
you’re reading an electronic version of this book, that is; in the printed book, all 
the figures are black and white).
 NOTE 	 The Windows Settings section in the Desktop View category’s My Preferences tab has two buttons: 
Display and Sounds. These buttons take you to the appropriate category of the Windows Control Panel to change 
your Windows settings, where any changes you make affect every program on your computer, not just QuickBooks.

CHARGE
• Company File Color Scheme. If you work on several different company files, 
you can assign a different color to each of them so you can tell them apart. In 
this drop-down list, pick a color (there are 15 to choose from) and QuickBooks 
changes the title bars of its main window and all open windows in QuickBooks, 
as shown in Figure 25-5. If you don’t like the result, choose a different color.
FIGURE 25-5
The top icon bar starts 
out with blue-and-gray 
icons on a dark-gray 
background. Turn on the 
“Switch to colored icon/
light background on the 
Top Icon Bar” checkbox to 
switch to a more colorful 
color scheme.
If you choose a different 
Company File Color 
Scheme setting, then when 
you open that company 
file, QuickBooks changes 
the main window’s title 
bar and any other open 
windows’ title bars to that 
color.
Customizing the Home Page
The Home Page has three horizontal panels for tasks related to vendors, customers, 
and employees, and additional panels for other accounting staples. The Company 
Preferences tab of the Desktop View category is where you can customize what 
appears there. See page 696 for the full story on customizing the Home Page.
Finance Charge
If you’re lucky enough to have customers who always pay on time or if you run a 
nonprofit organization that graciously accepts donations, you can bypass this pref­
erence category. But if you want to add an incentive for customers to pay on time, 
these preferences determine your level of persuasion.
Because you probably want a consistent policy for charging customers for late 
payments, all the preferences in the Finance Charge category are on the Company 
Preferences tab. That means only someone logged into QuickBooks as an admin­
istrator can change these settings. (Page 359 explains how to add finance charges 
to the invoices you create.)

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
647
FINANCE 
CHARGE
 TIP 	 If you plan to charge late fees, include the finance charge terms in your contracts. Your customers are 
less likely to complain if the added charges aren’t a surprise.
Here are the finance charge preferences you can set and what they mean to your 
customers:
• Annual Interest Rate (%). Type the interest rate that you charge per year for 
overdue payments. For example, if you charge 18 percent per year, type 18 in this 
box. QuickBooks adds the percent sign and calculates the finance charge due by 
prorating the annual interest date to the number of days that a payment is late.
• Minimum Finance Charge. If you charge a minimum finance charge no mat­
ter how inconsequential the overdue amount, type that value in this box. For 
example, to charge at least $20, type 20. (If you work with more than one cur­
rency, you still specify your minimum finance charge in your home currency. 
QuickBooks then converts the amount to the customer’s currency when you 
apply finance charges.)
• Grace Period (days). Just like the grace period that you probably appreciate 
on your mortgage, the grace period in QuickBooks is the number of days that a 
payment can be late before finance charges kick in. In this box, type the number 
of days of grace you’re willing to extend to your customers.
• Finance Charge Account. Choose the account you use to track finance charges 
you collect. Most companies create an Other Income account (page 57) to track 
these charges, which are interest income.
• Assess finance charges on overdue finance charges. If a customer goes AWOL 
and doesn’t pay the bill or the finance charges, you could consider levying 
finance charges on the finance charges that the customer already owes. For 
example, if your customer owes $100 in finance charges and you assess an 18 
percent finance charge, turning on this checkbox would result in an additional 
$18 the first year on the outstanding charges alone.
 NOTE 	 Most companies find it excessive to tack finance charges on overdue finance charges. Moreover, you 
should check the lending laws that apply to your location and business—some laws restrict your ability to charge 
interest on outstanding interest payments.
• Calculate charges from. You can calculate finance charges from two differ­
ent dates, depending on how painful you want the finance-charge penalty to 
be. Choosing the “due date” option here is the more lenient approach; it tells 
QuickBooks to assess finance charges only on the days that an invoice is paid 
past its due date. For example, if the customer pays 10 days late, QuickBooks 
calculates the finance charges for 10 days. If you want to assess finance charges 
from the date on the invoice, choose the “invoice/billed date” option instead. 
In that case, if the customer pays 10 days late on a Net 30 invoice (meaning 
payment is due within 30 days after the invoice date), QuickBooks calculates 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
648
GENERAL
finance charges based on 40 days—the 30 days until the invoice was due and 
the 10 days that the payment was late.
• Mark finance charge invoices “To be printed.” If you want QuickBooks to re­
mind you to print invoices with finance charges, turn on this checkbox. Invoices 
that you haven’t printed yet then appear as alerts in the Reminders window. If you 
send statements to your customers, turn off this checkbox, because the finance 
charge invoices you generate will be included on the statements you create.
General
QuickBooks selects the General preferences category the very first time you open 
the Preferences dialog box. Most of the General preferences appear on the My Prefer­
ences tab, so you can make QuickBooks work the way you do, but a few preferences 
apply to everyone who works on the company file.
Tuning QuickBooks to Your Liking
The following settings on the My Preferences tab can help you fine-tune QuickBooks’ 
behavior:
• Pressing Enter moves between fields. In the Windows world, pressing the 
Enter key usually activates the default button in a dialog box, while the Tab key 
advances the cursor to the next field. If you press Enter in QuickBooks and find 
that a dialog box or window closes unexpectedly, this checkbox can provide 
some relief. When you turn it on, pressing Enter moves the cursor between 
fields in a dialog box or window rather than closing it. However, because Enter 
no longer closes dialog boxes and windows, you have to press Ctrl+Enter or 
click a button—such as OK, Record, Save & Close, or Save & New (depending 
on the dialog box or window)—to do so.
• Automatically open drop-down lists when typing. This setting makes drop-
down menus spring open as soon as you type a letter in a field. You can then 
click the entry you want or press Enter to select the highlighted menu item, as 
shown in Figure 25-6.
• Beep when recording a transaction. If you like auditory assurance that your 
software is working, leave this checkbox turned on to have QuickBooks beep 
when it records a transaction. (You’ll hear the beep only if you haven’t muted 
the audio on your computer.) If you prefer peace and quiet, simply turn off this 
setting.
• Automatically place decimal point. When you turn on this checkbox, Quick-
Books places decimals so that the last two numbers you type represent cents. 
For example, typing 19995 automatically becomes 199.95. (If you want to enter a 
whole dollar, type a period at the end of the number.) Having QuickBooks place 
decimal points in numbers for you can be quite addictive once you get used to 
it, particularly if you haven’t graduated to rapid-fire entry on your computer’s 

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company

GENERAL
numeric keypad—or if you work on a laptop and haven’t realized that your 
keyboard has a numeric keypad.
FIGURE 25-6
With the “Automatically open drop-down lists 
when typing” preference turned on, drop-down 
lists appear as soon as you begin typing an entry 
in a field, so you can simply keep typing, click an 
entry, or press Enter when QuickBooks highlights 
the entry you want. The list displays only choices 
that match what you’ve typed so far. The list 
shown here includes “Meals” and “Monthly Fee” 
after typing “M.”
• Warn when editing a transaction. QuickBooks turns on this checkbox automati­
cally, which means that the program displays a warning if you edit a transaction 
and attempt to leave it (for instance, by clicking another transaction) without 
explicitly saving the change. If you inadvertently modify a transaction, like a 
check or invoice, this warning gives you a chance to either save the changes 
or exit without saving.
If you decide to turn off this feature, QuickBooks automatically records trans­
actions that aren’t linked to other transactions. However, if a transaction has 
links—such as a payment that links to a customer invoice—you need to save it 
after you change it regardless of how you’ve set this preference.
• Bring back all one time messages. One-time messages instruct beginners in 
the ways of QuickBooks, but for experienced folks, dismissing these messages 
simply consumes valuable time. If you were overly enthusiastic about hiding 
one-time messages and find yourself in need of QuickBooks’ mentoring, turn 
this checkbox on.
• Turn off pop-up messages for products and services. Initially, QuickBooks 
displays pop-up messages about other products and services that Intuit offers. If 
you’re content with what QuickBooks offers out of the box, turn this checkbox on.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
650
GENERAL
• Show ToolTips for clipped text. Text in QuickBooks fields is often longer than 
what you can see onscreen. For example, if you see the text “Make sure you 
always” in a text box, you’ll want to read the rest of the message. This checkbox, 
which is turned on initially, tells QuickBooks to display the entire contents of a 
field when you put your cursor over it.
• Warn when deleting a transaction or unused list item. QuickBooks turns this 
checkbox on automatically, so you have to confirm that you want to delete a 
transaction (such as a deposit or a check) or a list item that’s never been used 
in a transaction. Caution is a watchword in the financial world, so although 
QuickBooks lets you delete transactions, it’s a good idea to leave this setting 
on to make sure you’re deleting what you want. If you turn off this checkbox, 
you can delete a transaction or unused list item without confirmation.
 NOTE 	 Regardless of how this preference is set, QuickBooks won’t let you delete a list item, such as a customer 
type or shipping method, if it’s been used in even one transaction. Page 119 explains how to delete or inactivate 
list items.
• Keep QuickBooks running for quick startups. If you fire up QuickBooks fre­
quently, turn on this checkbox so the program launches faster (because it stays 
running in the background). In fact, with this setting, QuickBooks even launches 
in the background when you reboot your computer. If you turn off this checkbox, 
QuickBooks doesn’t run in the background or use your computer’s memory, so 
it takes longer to start up. That could be just what you want if your machine is 
short on memory and you want all your other programs to run more quickly.
• Automatically remember account or transaction information. Say you write 
checks each month to the same vendor, for the same amount, and post them to 
the same account. Out of the box, QuickBooks turns on the “Pre-fill accounts 
for vendor based on past entries” option in this section, which means that the 
program automatically fills in the accounts you use consistently for vendor 
transactions. But since you can set up pre-fill accounts for vendors with other 
QuickBooks features (page 85), the “Automatically recall last transaction for 
this name” option gives you more bang for the buck. With that option selected, 
when you type a name in a transaction, QuickBooks fills in the accounts and the 
rest of the values you used in the last transaction for that name.
However, AutoRecall has a couple of limitations: It can’t recall a transaction in 
one account if the previous transaction was in another account, and it can only 
recall transactions for bills, checks, and credit card charges. For other transac­
tions—such as purchase orders, invoices, sales receipts, and credit memos—you 
have to fill in all the fields or use a memorized transaction.
• Default date to use for new transactions. In this section of the My Preferences 
tab, choose the “Use today’s date as default” option if you want QuickBooks 
to put the current date in the Date field of every new transaction you create.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
651
GENERAL
If you create invoices over the course of several days but want each one to reflect 
the first day of the month, for example, choose the “Use the last entered date 
as default” option instead. Then, in the first invoice you create, type the date 
you want for all your invoices. For subsequent invoices, QuickBooks fills in the 
Date field with the date you entered on the previous invoice. When you want 
to use a new date (after all the month’s invoices are complete), simply type it 
in your next transaction.
 TIP 	 When the “Use the last entered date as default” option is selected, be sure to check the Date box in 
transaction windows (like Create Invoices) to make sure it’s the one you want.
• Keep custom item information when changing item in transactions. This 
setting determines how QuickBooks responds when you change an item in a 
transaction after customizing its description. Say you add an item to an invoice, 
edit the description in the invoice, and then realize that you added the wrong 
item. When you choose a new item to replace it, if you’ve selected the Ask option 
for this setting, QuickBooks asks whether you want to use the edited description 
for the new item. The Always option automatically applies the edited description 
to the new item. And the Never option discards the edited description and uses 
the description from the new item’s record.
Company-Wide General Preferences
The Company Preferences tab (Figure 25-7) includes four settings. (Remember, 
only a QuickBooks administrator can change these settings.) Here’s what they do:
• Time format. You can enter hours as either decimal numbers that represent 
hours and fractions of hours, or as hours and minutes separated by a colon, 
as you can see in Figure 25-7. This preference tells QuickBooks which way to 
display time values.
FIGURE 25-7
To display hours and 
minutes as decimals, 
choose the Decimal option. 
With this setting, if you 
type 15:45 (15 hours and 45 
minutes) in a time field, 
QuickBooks converts that 
to 15.75. To display hours 
and minutes instead, 
choose the Minutes 
option. With this setting, 
QuickBooks displays the 
entry 5.4 as 5:24.

INTEGRATED 
APPLICATIONS
• Always show years as 4 digits (1999). Turning on this setting tells QuickBooks 
to display all four digits of the year whether you type two digits or four. For 
example, if you type 15, then QuickBooks displays 2015. Turning off this check­
box makes the program display years as two digits. When you type a two-digit 
number for a year, QuickBooks translates numbers from 00 through 43 as years 
2000 through 2043; 44 through 99 become 1944 through 1999.
 TIP 	 If you turn off the “Always show years as 4 digits” checkbox, QuickBooks does as it’s told and displays 
only two digits for the year. If a date field shows 40 and you want to see whether that stands for 1940 or 2040, 
in the date field, click the Calendar icon. The Calendar shows both the month and the full four-digit year.
• Never update name information when saving transactions. QuickBooks 
initially turns this checkbox off so that, when you edit the name of a customer 
or vendor, for example, the program asks if you want to replicate that change 
back in the original record—on the Customer:Job List or Vendor List. The only 
situation where you might want to change this behavior (by turning on this 
checkbox) is if you use generic names, such as Donor or Member. If you receive 
donations and your donors want receipts with their names and addresses filled 
in, you don’t want the names and addresses you enter on sales receipts to alter 
your generic donor record.
• Save transactions before printing. QuickBooks turns this checkbox on initially, 
and it’s a good idea to leave it that way. It tells the program to save transactions 
before you print them so that the transactions in QuickBooks are the same as 
the ones you print. If you turn this checkbox off, you could print the transaction 
with one set of data and then close the dialog box or window without saving that 
data, thus making your QuickBooks records different from your paper records.
Integrated Applications
As you’ll learn in more detail in Chapter 26, QuickBooks plays well with other pro­
grams, like Microsoft Excel and Word, and oodles of third-party applications. For 
example, by integrating Microsoft Outlook with QuickBooks, you can easily keep your 
contact information synchronized in both programs. And other software companies 
create all sorts of programs that integrate with QuickBooks for tasks like inventory 
tracking, project tracking, creating barcodes, and so on. If you’re a QuickBooks ad­
ministrator, the Integrated Applications preferences category is where you control 
which programs can interact with QuickBooks and the extent of their interaction. 
For example, you can use another program to produce estimates and then transfer 
the completed estimates into QuickBooks to fill out invoices and other forms.
To access these preferences, choose Edit→Preferences→Integrated Applications. 
Here’s a guide to adjusting the settings on the Company Preferences tab to allow 
or restrict other programs’ access to your QuickBooks company file:

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
653
ITEMS & 
INVENTORY
• Don’t allow any applications to access this company file. The quickest way 
to prevent other programs from using a QuickBooks company file is to turn on 
this checkbox. When you do so, QuickBooks doesn’t allow integrated programs 
to access the file and stops displaying screens requesting access. If you want 
QuickBooks to display access screens, leave this checkbox off.
• Notify the user before running any application whose certificate has expired. 
The most security conscious of administrators might turn on this checkbox to 
see a warning if a program trying to access the QuickBooks company file has 
an expired certificate. But an expired certificate doesn’t mean that the program 
has changed or has morphed into malicious code—only that the certificate has 
expired. For most administrators, leaving this checkbox off is preferable.
• Applications that have previously requested access to this company file. 
When programs request access to a company file, QuickBooks displays an access 
screen to the QuickBooks administrator, who has to approve or deny access. 
Programs that have received approval to access your company file appear in 
this list. To deny access to one of these programs, click its checkmark in the 
Allow Access column, or select the program and then click Remove.
Items & Inventory
These preferences apply mainly to what QuickBooks does when you create purchase 
orders or invoices for inventory. The first setting on the Company Preferences tab is 
the most important: You tell QuickBooks that you want to track inventory by turn­
ing on the “Inventory and purchase orders are active” checkbox, which activates 
the program’s inventory-related features (Chapter 20) and adds icons like Purchase 
Orders and Receive Inventory to the Home Page. (The box on page 654 describes 
the inventory preferences you can set if you use QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise.) 
If you turn on inventory tracking, here are the other settings you may want to adjust:
• Warn about duplicate purchase order numbers. Leave this checkbox on if 
you want QuickBooks to alert you when you’re creating a purchase order with 
the same number as one you already entered.
• Warn if not enough inventory quantity on hand (QOH) to sell. In QuickBooks 
Pro, you can turn this checkbox on so QuickBooks will warn you if you prepare 
an invoice to sell more doodads than you have in stock. Suppose you sell 500 
quarts of mascarpone blackberry ice cream, but you have only 400 quarts in 
stock. When you attempt to save the invoice for the 500-quart order, Quick­
Books displays a message box informing you of the shortage—but doesn’t go 
any further than that. You can save the invoice, but it’s up to you to order more 
inventory. Besides giving you a heads-up that inventory is low, this setting helps 
you keep your customers happy, since you can ask them if they want to wait for 
a backorder to be filled. The box on page 654 explains QuickBooks Premier’s 
inventory-on-hand options.

QuickBooks Premier’s Inventory Settings
You can obtain a few additional inventory preferences by 
upgrading from QuickBooks Pro to QuickBooks Premier, which 
lets you adjust the following settings:
• When calculating Quantity Available for my inventory, 
deduct. QuickBooks Premier tracks two quantities for 
inventory items. Quantity On Hand is the actual number 
of items sitting in inventory. Quantity Available can equal 
Quantity On Hand, but you can also tell QuickBooks to 
remove the number of items on sales orders or used 
in pending builds (when you build products out of 
components) from the Quantity Available number. If you 
use sales orders (page 654) to track orders that haven’t 
been invoiced, QuickBooks automatically turns on the 
“Quantity on Sales Order” checkbox here. With this setting 
selected, QuickBooks calculates the number of inventory 
items available by deducting the number of items on sales 
orders from the number of items on hand, which helps 
prevent you from accidentally selling out-of-stock items. If 
you turn this checkbox off, the Quantity Available reflects 
only the inventory that’s been invoiced and shipped, so 
you won’t know that your inventory is low until you start 
filling the sales orders you created.
• Warn if not enough inventory to sell. In QuickBooks 
Premier, you can specify whether you want the program 
to warn you when the quantity being sold is greater than 
the quantity on hand or the quantity available. Because 
quantity available is equal to or less than the quantity on 
hand, choosing that option is the safest route.
• Unit of measure. In QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise, 
you can specify units of measure for inventory items. To 
do this, in the Unit of Measure section, click the Enable 
button. You can then select Single U/M Per Item to define 
one unit of measure per inventory item. If you use 
QuickBooks Enterprise and some QuickBooks Premier 
editions (Accountant, Contractor, and Manufacturing & 
Wholesale), you can assign more than one unit of measure 
in case you sell wine by the bottle, by the case, and by 
the barrel, for example. To do that, select the Multiple 
U/M Per Item option.
You define units of measure in the Create Item or Edit 
Item window (page 106). To open the Unit of Measure 
dialog box to the “Select a Unit of Measure Type” screen 
in either of those windows, in the Unit of Measure box, 
click the down arrow, and then choose the measure you 
want. To add a new unit of measure, click <Add New> in 
the drop-down list.
 NOTE 	 Unless you use QuickBooks Enterprise, the Advanced Inventory Settings button (located on the Items 
& Inventory category’s Company Preferences tab) is grayed out. To see whether these settings are worth the cost 
of upgrading, click the “Learn about serial #/lots, FIFO and multi-location inventory” link.
Jobs & Estimates
If you create estimates or document job progress in QuickBooks, head to the Jobs 
& Estimates preferences category to set up your progress terminology and estimat­
ing features.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
655
JOBS & 
ESTIMATES
QuickBooks includes five job-status settings, which are all listed on the Company 
Preferences tab in this category: Pending, Awarded, In progress, Closed, and Not 
awarded. Despite the fields’ names, you can type any term you want in any of the 
five boxes. For example, you can type Waiting in the Pending box, Whoopie! in the 
Awarded box, and Finally! in the Closed box. Then, when you edit a job and display 
the Job Status drop-down list (page 82), you can choose from these custom terms.
Here are the other settings on the Company Preferences tab for this category:
• Do you create estimates? Choose the Yes option only if you want to create 
estimates in QuickBooks, as described on page 278, so the program adds the 
Estimates icon to the Home Page. If you create estimates in a program other 
than QuickBooks, choose the No option.
• Do you do progress invoicing? Also known as “partial billing,” progress invoic­
ing means that you invoice your customer for work as you go instead of billing 
for the entire job at the end. For example, if you’re building a shopping mall, 
you don’t want to carry the costs of construction until shoppers walk in the 
front door—you want to charge your client as you meet milestones. To create 
invoices for portions of your estimates, choose the Yes option. That way, you 
can invoice for part of an estimate and show how much you billed previously, 
as described on page 284.
 NOTE 	 If you choose the No option, you can still create progress invoices from your entire estimate. After 
you bring the whole estimate into your invoice, remove entries until the invoice includes only what you want to 
bill. The flaw in this approach is that you can’t show previous billed totals or compare the billed and remaining 
amounts with your estimate.
• Close estimates after converting to invoice. This checkbox is grayed out if 
progress invoicing is turned on. If you don’t do progress invoicing, turn on this 
checkbox to tell QuickBooks to make an estimate inactive after you’ve converted 
it to an invoice. That way, you won’t accidentally create another invoice from 
an estimate you’ve already invoiced. You might decide to turn this checkbox 
off to keep estimates around in case you end up with a similar job in the future. 
However, a better way to create boilerplate estimates is to memorize the ones 
you want to reuse, as explained on page 321.
• Warn about duplicate estimate numbers. Leave this checkbox on if you want 
QuickBooks to alert you if you’re creating an estimate with the same number 
as one you already entered.
• Don’t print items that have zero amount. This checkbox is grayed out unless 
you select Yes in the “Do you do progress invoicing?” section. If you do use 
progress invoicing, you might not charge for every estimated item on every 
progress invoice. To keep your progress invoices tidy, suppress the items that 
you’re not charging for by leaving this checkbox turned on.

MULTIPLE 
CURRENCIES
Multiple Currencies
If you use only one currency, you can skip these preferences, because QuickBooks 
automatically selects the “No, I use only one currency” option. But if you have cus­
tomers who pay you in other currencies (as shown in Figure 25-8) or vendors who 
want to be paid in their countries’ currencies, you can turn on the multiple currency 
preference. Just know that once you turn this setting on, it’s on for good. If you 
stop doing business with foreign-currency customers and vendors, you can simply 
skip the currency boxes in QuickBooks’ windows and dialog boxes (the program 
automatically fills them in with your home currency).
To turn on multiple currencies, choose Edit→Preferences→Multiple Currencies, and 
then click the Company Preferences tab. Select the “Yes, I use more than one cur­
rency” option. QuickBooks initially sets the home currency to US Dollar, but you can 
change that in the “Select the home currency you use in transactions” drop-down list.
FIGURE 25-8
In transaction windows and dialog 
boxes, QuickBooks initially fills in 
the Currency box with your home 
currency. 
However, after you set up a cus-
tomer or vendor to use a foreign 
currency, QuickBooks automati-
cally uses that currency instead, as 
shown here.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company

PAYROLL & 
EMPLOYEES
Payments
In this category, the Company Preferences tab lets you set the following options:
• Automatically apply payments. You’ll probably want to turn this checkbox off 
so you can choose the customer invoices to which you want to apply payments 
you receive. With this checkbox on, QuickBooks applies customer payments 
to invoices for you. If a payment doesn’t match any of the invoice amounts, 
QuickBooks applies the payment to the oldest invoices first, which could mask 
the fact that a payment wasn’t received or that a customer’s check was for the 
wrong amount.
• Automatically calculate payments. This preference, on the other hand, is one 
you’ll want to keep turned on. When you receive a payment from a customer, 
in the Receive Payments window’s Amount box, you typically type the amount 
that the customer sent. Then, as you choose the invoices to apply the payment 
to, QuickBooks calculates the payment for you. If the customer underpaid, 
QuickBooks asks if you want to keep the underpayment or write off the amount 
that the customer didn’t pay. When this checkbox is off, as you choose invoices, 
you also have to enter the amount of the payment that you want to allocate 
to each invoice.
• Use Undeposited Funds as a default deposit to account. If you typically col­
lect several payments before heading to the bank to deposit them, leave this 
checkbox turned on so QuickBooks automatically adds payments you receive 
to the Undeposited Funds account and doesn’t display the “Deposit to” box in 
the Receive Payments window. If, on the other hand, you want a say in whether 
to deposit payments right away, turn this checkbox off. That way, in the Receive 
Payments window’s Deposit To field, you can choose a bank account to deposit 
funds immediately, or you can choose Undeposited Funds to collect several 
payments before you make a deposit.

Payroll & Employees
Perhaps the most annoying thing about employees is their insistence on being 
paid. Sad to say, but using QuickBooks for payroll doesn’t eliminate the need to pay 
your employees, and it can only simplify the task so much. If you choose one of the 
QuickBooks payroll service options, head to the Payroll & Employees preference 
category to configure your payroll service and how it operates. (Chapter 15 explains 
what Intuit’s various payroll services offer. To learn how to sign up for one and use

EMPLOYEES
it to set up employee records, run payroll, and remit payroll taxes, download online 
Appendix D from this book’s Missing CD page at www.missing manuals.com/cds.) 
Payroll and employee preferences appear on the Company Preferences tab, so only 
QuickBooks administrators can set them. The tab’s QuickBooks Payroll Features 
section gives you three options for choosing a payroll service. Here’s some info that 
can help you determine which one to choose:
• Full payroll. This is the option you want if you use an Intuit payroll service to 
figure out payroll amounts or if you calculate payroll yourself and use Quick-
Books’ features to produce the necessary documents. With this option selected, 
you can produce documents such as paychecks; payroll reports; and payroll 
forms, including 940s (employer federal unemployment taxes), 941s (employer 
quarterly federal taxes), W-2s (employee wage and tax statements), and W-3s 
(transmittal of W-2s).
• No payroll. Choose this option if you don’t run payroll in any way or you use 
a third-party payroll service. For example, if you’re a sole proprietor and pay 
yourself by taking owner’s draws, or if you use an outside payroll service such 
as Paychex or ADP and have no need to print payroll documents or assign 
payroll costs to jobs, choose this option. With this option selected, you don’t 
see payroll-related features in the Employees menu or in the Employee Center.
 NOTE 	 If you have transactions from prior payrolls and then switch to using an outside payroll service, the 
past payroll data remains in your QuickBooks file.
• Online Payroll. If you use Intuit Online Payroll, choose this option. When you 
use this service, you can also run payroll without QuickBooks.
The Payroll & Employees preference category has plenty of additional settings that 
are intimately linked to payroll. For example, you can specify the deductions and 
Payroll items that affect every employee, and control the fields that appear on pay­
checks and paycheck stubs. Download online Appendix D from this book’s Missing 
CD page at www.missing manuals.com/cds to learn how to set these preferences.
Whether you run payroll or not, here’s the lowdown on the remaining preferences 
that don’t relate to payroll:
• Display employee list by. If your company employs only a few people, you can 
choose the First Name option so that QuickBooks sorts the Employee List by 
first names. However, if you have hundreds of employees, choose the Last Name 
option. Regardless of which option you choose, QuickBooks prints paychecks 
with employee first names first and last names last.
• Mark new employees as sales reps. If only a few of your employees act as 
customer contacts and receive commissions, you can reserve the Sales Rep List 
for them by leaving this checkbox off and adding names to that list manually 
(page 147). But if you consider every employee a potential sales rep, turn on this 

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
659
REPORTS AND 
GRAPHS
checkbox so that QuickBooks automatically adds every employee you create 
to the Sales Rep List, saving you a five-step process each time.
• Display employee social security numbers in headers on reports. QuickBooks 
automatically turns off this checkbox, which is preferable if you want to protect 
your employees’ financial privacy.
Reminders
QuickBooks can remind you when it’s time to perform tasks like printing checks, 
paying bills, and depositing money. You can even turn on reminders for to-dos so 
the program can remind you about tasks that you don’t want to forget. Page 483 
describes how reminders work and how to set preferences so you receive the re­
minders you want when you want them.
In the Reminders preference category, the My Preferences tab has only one setting: 
“Show Reminders List when opening a Company file.” Turn this checkbox on to tell 
QuickBooks to display the Reminders window whenever you open your company file. 
The Company Preferences tab contains settings for different types of reminders, 
which are available only if you’ve turned on the corresponding feature. For example, 
if you don’t use QuickBooks inventory, the “Inventory to Reorder” reminder is grayed 
out. See page 484 to learn the difference between the Show Summary and Show 
List options for each reminder. Page 484 also describes how to specify the level of 
detail you want to see in the Reminders window and, in some cases, when you want 
QuickBooks to remind you.
 TIP 	 Regardless of which Reminders settings you choose, the “View reminders” icon appears at the top right 
of the program’s main window. The icon looks like an alarm clock, and the numbered label to its right shows how 
many reminders await you. To open the Reminders window, click this icon.
Reports and Graphs
Each person who logs into QuickBooks can specify a few preferences for the reports 
and graphs he generates. And QuickBooks administrators can modify settings that 
apply to every report and graph their company produces.
Preferences for the Reports You Generate
Here’s a guide to the personal preferences shown in Figure 25-9:
• Prompt me to modify report options before opening a report. You usually 
need to tweak reports a little to make them show exactly what you want—a dif­
ferent date range, perhaps—so turning on this checkbox works for most people. 
With this checkbox turned on, QuickBooks automatically opens the Modify 
Report window when you generate a report so you can make any changes you 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
660
REPORTS AND 
GRAPHS
want. (After you make your changes, click OK to view the results.) If you leave 
this checkbox turned off, then you can make changes by clicking Customize 
Report in a report window.
FIGURE 25-9
Keeping reports up to 
date with the informa-
tion in your company’s 
QuickBooks file can be 
time-consuming. To 
accommodate the inclina-
tions of each person who 
logs into the program, 
the settings on the My 
Preferences tab control 
how QuickBooks updates 
reports and graphs.
• Reports and Graphs. This set of preferences lets you decide what QuickBooks 
should do when a report or graph needs to be refreshed because the data 
within it has changed. You can choose one of the following options (QuickBooks 
automatically selects the first option unless you change it):
—
— Prompt me to refresh. If your QuickBooks file changes frequently and 
you don’t want to wait while the program refreshes every report you have 
open, choose this option. When you do, QuickBooks reminds you to refresh 
reports when you’ve changed data that affects them. For example, sup­
pose you generated a Profit & Loss report and then received a payment 
for a customer; with this setting selected, QuickBooks would prompt you 
to refresh the report. To refresh a report or graph, simply click Refresh in 
the report’s window.
—
— Refresh automatically. If numerous people are frantically changing data 
in the company file, as often happens as year-end approaches, this option 
can slow your work. However, if it’s critical that your reports and graphs are 
always accurate, choose this option so QuickBooks automatically refreshes 
reports and graphs whenever the underlying data changes.
—
— Don’t refresh. If you find yourself distracted by refreshes or even prompts 
about refreshing, choose this option. That way, QuickBooks won’t refresh 
your reports and graphs or remind you—no matter how significant the 
changes to the underlying data. When you’ve finished your report and 
graph customizations, click Refresh in the report’s window to generate the 
report with the current data.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company

REPORTS AND 
GRAPHS
• Draw graphs in 2D (faster). If you care about time more than fancy graphics, 
turn on this checkbox. QuickBooks then displays graphs in two dimensions, 
which is faster than drawing the 3-D graphs it generates if you leave this 
checkbox off.
• Use patterns. When you turn on this checkbox, QuickBooks uses black-and-
white patterns instead of colors to differentiate areas on graphs. If you leave 
this checkbox off, QuickBooks displays colors on color monitors and shades of 
gray on black-and-white monitors.
Company-Wide Report Preferences
The Company Preferences tab has several preferences for the reports and graphs 
your company generates. If you’re a QuickBooks administrator, use the following 
preferences to format reports and graphs:
• Summary Reports Basis. Nothing starts adrenaline flowing like financial reports 
that aren’t what you expect, particularly when IRS auditors are dropping by to 
peruse your company’s books. Be sure to choose the correct option here—Cash 
or Accrual (page xxii explains the difference)—so that the reports you generate 
accurately reflect your financial performance.
• Aging Reports. You can control how QuickBooks calculates age for invoices, 
statements, and bills. If you choose the “Age from due date” option, the program 
shows the number of days between the due date and the current date. If you 
choose “Age from transaction date” instead, QuickBooks shows the number of 
overdue days from the date of the transaction to the current date. For example, 
suppose an invoice is dated September 1 with a due date of October 1. On October 
10, the “Age from due date” option shows the invoice’s age as 10 days, whereas 
the “Age from transaction date” option shows the invoice’s age as 40 days.
• Reports – Show Items By. Reports initially list items by name and description, 
but you can choose a different option here to show only the name or only the 
description.
• Reports – Show Accounts By. Reports typically list accounts by name. If you 
use especially short account names, you can use the account descriptions in 
reports instead. You can also show both names and descriptions.
• Statement of Cash Flows. Although QuickBooks does a great job of associat­
ing your accounts with the Operating, Investing, and Financing categories of 
the Statement of Cash Flows report, some companies are bound to require a 
customized cash flow report. In that case, click Classify Cash here to open the 
Classify Cash dialog box. (See page 454 to learn how to generate and customize 
a cash flow statement for your company.)
• Default formatting for reports. Turn on this checkbox if you want to use Quick­
Books’ default formatting for your reports. If you want to set the formatting for 
your reports, keep this checkbox turned off, and then click the Format button 
to open the Report Format Preferences dialog box. The settings in this dialog

box are the same ones that appear in the Modify Report dialog box’s Header/
Footer and Fonts & Numbers tabs (page 599). You can choose the information 
that you want to appear in headers and footers, and whether they’re aligned 
to the left, right, or center of the page. You can also choose formatting for the 
report’s text and numbers.
Sales & Customers
These preferences, shown in Figure 25-10, control how QuickBooks handles sales 
you make to your customers, including the shipping method you use and whether 
the program notifies you that you’ve created a duplicate invoice number.
FIGURE 25-10
Company preferences 
in the Sales & Custom-
ers category affect the 
information that appears 
on invoices. 
This tab also lets you turn 
on other sales-related 
features like sales orders, 
price levels, and the Col-
lections Center.
The My Preferences tab has options that tell the program what to do about outstand­
ing billable time and expenses. Here’s what each one does:
• Prompt for time/costs to add. If you often bill for time and expenses, select 
this option. That way, the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box (shown 
in Figure 10-18 on page 255) opens automatically when you create an invoice 
for a customer who has outstanding billable time charges or expenses.
• Don’t add any. Select this option if you rarely have time or expenses to invoice 
and don’t want to see the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box or receive 
a reminder that outstanding time and expenses exist.
• Ask what to do. This option merely adds an additional step to what the “Prompt 
for time/costs to add” option does because you have to tell QuickBooks whether 
to open the “Choose Billable Time and Costs” dialog box. Selecting the “Prompt 
for time/costs to add” option instead is your best bet.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
663
SALES & 
CUSTOMERS
Here’s a guide to the Sales & Customers preferences on the Company Preferences 
tab, all of which only QuickBooks administrators can change:
• Usual Shipping Method. If you negotiate a sweet deal with a shipping company 
and use it whenever possible, choose that company in this drop-down list. From 
then on, QuickBooks automatically selects this method in sales forms’ Ship Via 
(or Via) fields. If the method you want to use isn’t on the list, choose <Add New> 
to open the New Ship Method dialog box (page 152).
• Usual FOB. FOB stands for “free on board” and represents the location at which 
the customer becomes responsible for the products you ship. For example, sup­
pose you ship products from your warehouse in Severance, Colorado, and you 
use Severance as your FOB location. As soon as your shipments leave Severance, 
the customer becomes the official owner of the products and is responsible for 
them if they get lost, damaged, or stolen in transit. Type a brief description of 
your FOB location in this box, and QuickBooks puts that info in the FOB field 
on invoices and other sales forms.
• Warn about duplicate invoice numbers. Turn on this checkbox if you want 
QuickBooks to alert you when you create an invoice with the same number as 
one you already entered.
• Choose template for invoice packing slip. If you ship products to customers, 
you can print a packing slip from QuickBooks to include in your shipments. To 
specify the packing slip you want to use, choose it in this drop-down list. From 
then on, when you create an invoice and choose Print→Packing Slip (page 
317), QuickBooks automatically uses the template you selected. The program 
initially selects its built-in Intuit Packing Slip here, but you can create your own, 
as described on page 707.
• Enable Collections Center. If your customers always pay on time, you can 
turn this checkbox off. On the other hand, if you regularly get after customers 
to pay up, the Collections Center can help (see page 341). When you turn this 
checkbox on, you’ll see the Collections Center icon in the Customer Center’s 
toolbar. Income Tracker, introduced in QuickBooks 2014, provides another way 
to see the customer payments that are overdue.
• Custom Pricing. You can set multiple prices for the items you sell by using price 
levels. To do so, select the Enable Price Levels option here. Then refer to page 
144 and page 146 to learn how to define and apply price levels, respectively.
• Sales orders. This preference is available only in QuickBooks Premier and En­
terprise, which let you use sales orders to record customer orders before you 
create invoices. To do so, turn on the Enable Sales Orders checkbox. With it 
turned on, you can tell QuickBooks to warn you when you create a sales order 
with duplicate numbers, and to leave off any items with zero amounts when 
you convert a sales order into an invoice.

SALES TAX
Sales Tax
Charging sales tax can be a complicated business, as the number of preferences on 
the Sales Tax category’s Company Preferences tab indicates. If you don’t charge 
sales tax, then in the “Do You Charge Sales Tax?” area, simply leave the No option 
selected and move on to more important endeavors. If you do charge sales tax, you 
can learn how to adjust the rest of these preferences as you set up Sales Tax items, 
charge sales tax, and pay sales tax to the appropriate authorities starting on page 547.
Search
The Search box (which is located at the top of the left icon bar or at the right end of 
the top icon bar) lets you search your company file to find customers, vendors, and 
other names; transactions like invoices and bills; amounts; dates; and text within 
memos, notes, and descriptions. If you use the top icon bar, on the My Preferences 
tab in this category, the “Show Search field in the Icon Bar” checkbox is turned on 
automatically, which makes the Search box easy to access at all times; if you turn 
this checkbox off, you can access the search feature by choosing Edit→Search. If 
you use the left icon bar or hide both icon bars, these preferences are grayed out 
because the Search box always appears at the top of the left icon bar.
Sometimes, you want to find things in your company file, like an invoice number 
or an inventory item. Other times, you want to search QuickBooks’ help files to 
find out how to do something in the program. Out of the box, QuickBooks sets the 
“Choose where to search by default” setting to “Let me choose where I search each 
time.” That way, when you type in the Search box in the top or left icon bar, you can 
choose “Search company file” or “Help” from the box’s drop-down menu. However, 
if you’re a whiz at QuickBooks, you can choose the “Search my company file” option 
instead so that QuickBooks automatically searches your company file for whatever 
you type in the Search box. If you usually need help using QuickBooks, select the 
“Search QuickBooks help” option instead.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks always searches your company file when you choose Edit→Search.
The Company Preferences tab contains settings that control how often QuickBooks 
updates the data it uses to search. Because these updates make the program run a 
little slower, you have to compromise between performance and up-to-date informa­
tion. QuickBooks initially turns on the “Update automatically” checkbox, and that’s 
usually what you want. In the “Update every” drop-down list, choose a frequency for 
the automatic updates. In most cases, 30 or 60 minutes works well. If you want to 
update search info now, click Update Now. If you turn off the “Update automatically” 
checkbox, QuickBooks might run a little faster but you then have to click the Update 
Now button to be sure that you’re searching up-to-date info in your company file.

SEND FORMS
Send Forms
As you’ve learned throughout this book, you can include a cover note when you send 
invoices, purchase orders, and other business forms via email. For example, if you 
email a purchase order, you can include details about the delivery in the note. Or 
you can include a cover note along with an invoice to add some personal interaction 
with your customer. When you email an invoice or other form, QuickBooks opens 
an Outlook email window—or, if you use a web-based email service, the dialog box 
corresponding to the form you’re sending (Send Invoice, for example)—with your 
note filled in. The program attaches your invoice or other sales form to the email 
as a PDF file.
The settings in this preference category let you tell QuickBooks about your email 
program and email address, and set up templates for the messages you send.
Setting Your Send Preferences
On the My Preferences tab, QuickBooks automatically turns on the “Auto-check the 
‘Email Later’ checkbox if customer’s Preferred Delivery Method is e-mail” checkbox. 
That way, you don’t have to remember whether customers prefer to receive paper­
work by email or snail mail.
In the tab’s Send E-mail Using section, select the Outlook option if you want to send 
QuickBooks email using Microsoft Outlook. (This option appears only if Outlook is 
installed on your computer.) If you use a web-based email service, select the Web 
Mail option, as shown in Figure 25-11, and then click Add at the bottom of the tab 
to tell QuickBooks about your email service. In the Add Email Info dialog box, fill in 
your email address and select your email provider (Gmail or Yahoo, for example), 
and QuickBooks fills in the Server Name and Port fields with the typical settings for 
that provider. If you use an email provider other than the ones on the list, choose 
Others as your provider, and then fill in the Server Name and Port fields manually. 
The third option in the tab’s Send E-mail Using section, QuickBooks E-mail, is ac­
tive only if you subscribe to services such as QuickBooks Payroll, Intuit Merchant 
Services, and QuickBooks Enterprise Full Service Plan.
Customizing Messages
QuickBooks includes standard messages for each type of form you send via email. 
If you want to customize the messages you send out, any QuickBooks administrator 
can change them. (You can create more than one template for a transaction type. 
However, you can choose the template you want to apply to a message only if you 
use Web Mail, not Outlook, to send messages from QuickBooks.) You can create 
standard notes for invoices, estimates, statements, sales orders, sales receipts, 
credit memos, purchase orders, reports, pay stubs, overdue invoices, almost-due 
invoices, and payment receipts. If your company has standard letters on file, you 
can simply copy and paste the contents of those letters from another program, such 
as Microsoft Word, into QuickBooks, as explained next.

If you use a web-based 
email service like Gmail 
or Yahoo, you can set 
QuickBooks up to send 
communications through 
that service.
Select the Web Mail option 
as shown here, click the 
Add button (not shown), 
and then specify the 
settings for your web-mail 
account.
To configure a standard note for a particular type of form, in the Preferences dialog 
box, go to the Send Forms category, click the Company Preferences tab, and then 
follow these steps:
1.	 In the Show drop-down list, choose the form you want to customize.
For example, to set up a cover letter for your invoices, choose Invoices.
2.	 To create a new template, click Add Template. To edit an existing template, 
select it in the template table, and then click Edit.
Depending on which button you clicked, the Add Email Template or Edit Email 
Template dialog box opens. The former displays a sample message.
3.	 If you’re creating a new template, in the Template Name box, type the name 
of the template.
To tell QuickBooks to use this template automatically, turn on the Default 
checkbox.
4.	 To insert a field in the subject or message, click to position your cursor in 
the text, and then click the Insert Field button and choose what you want 
to insert.

SERVICE 
CONNECTION
For example, to tell QuickBooks to insert a name with the first name followed 
by the last name, choose Name-First-Last.
5.	 Edit the content of the note using typical editing techniques.
For instance, click in the text to position the cursor where you want to add text, 
drag your cursor to select text you want to replace, or double-click a word to 
select it. To use a standard letter that’s stored in another program, open the 
letter in that program and copy the text, and then paste it into QuickBooks by 
pressing Ctrl+V.
To make sure everything is spelled correctly, click the Check Spelling button at 
the dialog box’s bottom left, and QuickBooks alerts you to any suspect words 
in the subject line or body of your letter.
6.	 To save your changes, click Save.
If you created a new template, it appears in the template table.
Service Connection
If your company uses QuickBooks’ services, such as bank feeds, QuickBooks admin­
istrators can control how people log into those services by adjusting the settings 
in this preference category. (The easiest way to learn about or sign up for these 
services is to choose Help→Add QuickBooks Services, and then click the Learn More 
button or the link for the one you want.)
As explained in a moment, each person who uses QuickBooks services can control 
the behavior of online sessions, but security is a company-wide issue, so the options 
for whether to prompt for a password appear on the Company Preferences tab. 
Here are the service connection preferences that administrators can set and when 
you might want to use them:
• Automatically connect without asking for a password. Choosing this option 
automatically logs people into the QuickBooks Business Services network 
without a login name or password. This option is appropriate if you’re the only 
person who accesses the network or you aren’t concerned about security.
• Always ask for a password before connecting. Choose this option to make 
your employees provide a login name and password each time they access 
QuickBooks Business Services. This option is handy if several people access the 
services or if different people have different privileges with the services you use.
• Allow background downloading of service messages. If you want QuickBooks 
to check for messages and updates when your Internet connection isn’t tied 
up with other work, leave this checkbox turned on. QuickBooks then checks 
the Intuit website periodically and downloads updates or messages. If you turn 
this checkbox off, you can check for updates at a convenient time by choosing 
Help→Update QuickBooks.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
668
SPELLING
If you aren’t a QuickBooks administrator, you can still make some choices about your 
connection to QuickBooks Business Services. On the My Preferences tab, the “Give 
me the option of saving a file whenever I download Web Connect data” checkbox 
lets you decide when to process downloaded transactions. If you want QuickBooks 
to ask you whether to process downloaded transactions immediately or save them 
to a file, leave this checkbox on. If you turn it off, QuickBooks processes downloaded 
transactions immediately.
You can launch QuickBooks by downloading WebConnect data or by double-clicking 
a QuickBooks file that contains WebConnect data you downloaded previously. When 
you open the program this way, you often want to continue working in QuickBooks 
after you process the downloaded transactions. To keep QuickBooks open after it 
processes transactions, leave the “If QuickBooks is run by my browser, don’t close 
it after WebConnect is done” checkbox turned on.
Spelling
QuickBooks’ spell checker helps you find common misspellings in most text fields. 
Spell checking is a personal preference: Each person who logs into a company file 
can choose whether to use spell checking by leaving the “Always check spelling 
before printing, saving, or sending supported forms” checkbox on or turning it off.
If you leave spell checking on, you can choose words that you want the spell checker 
to ignore. You can tell it to ignore Internet addresses, words that contain numbers, 
words that begin with a capital letter, words that are in all uppercase letters, and 
words with a mixture of upper- and lowercase letters.
When QuickBooks checks spelling in transactions you record, such as item descrip­
tions in invoices, you can click Add to add custom words to the program’s dictionary 
so that QuickBooks won’t flag those unusual spellings in future transactions. You’ll 
see the custom words you’ve added in the Word table on the My Preferences tab. 
To remove a custom word from the dictionary, in the table, click its “Delete?” cell 
to add a checkmark.
Tax: 1099
The Company Preferences tab in this category begins with the most important 1099 
question: “Do you file 1099-MISC forms?” If you don’t use 1099 vendors such as 
self-employed subcontractors, or you delegate 1099 generation to your accountant, 
simply choose the No option and ignore the rest of the preferences in this category. 
If you do file 1099-MISC forms, you can specify the accounts you use to track 1099 
vendor payments and the minimum amount you have to report to the IRS. To learn 
how to map accounts to 1099 boxes and generate 1099s, flip to page 468.

Chapter 25: Configuring Preferences to Fit Your Company
669
TIME & 
EXPENSES
Time & Expenses
In this category, the first setting on the Company Preferences tab tells QuickBooks 
whether you track time at all. If you do, select the Yes option. Then you can choose 
the first day of the workweek that appears if you use weekly timesheets in Quick­
Books (page 167). The “Mark all time entries as billable” checkbox is initially turned 
on, but if you bill only some of your time, turn this checkbox off. That way, you can 
designate time as billable by turning on the Billable checkbox or cell in the Write 
Checks or Enter Bills windows or in a timesheet.
The Invoicing Options section has settings related to how you handle billable time 
and expenses on invoices:
• Create invoices from a list of time and expenses. This checkbox is available 
only in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise. If you turn it on, the Customer menu 
includes the “Invoice for Time & Expenses” entry, which lets you view a list of 
all your unbilled time and expenses and select the customers you want to bill, 
as described on page 254.
• Track reimbursed expenses as income. Companies differ in their approach 
to reimbursed expenses, as explained on page 193. Some assign reimbursed 
expenses as income and then deduct the expenses as costs. The method you 
choose doesn’t affect the profit you earn—the reason for tracking reimbursable 
expenses as income is to charge sales tax on those expenses. If you want to post 
reimbursed expenses to an income account, turn on this checkbox.
• Mark all expenses as billable. This checkbox is initially turned on, which means 
QuickBooks automatically marks all your expenses as billable. If only some of 
your expenses are billable to your customers, turn this checkbox off so you can 
turn on the Billable checkbox or cell in a timesheet or bill to designate specific 
expenses as billable to a customer or job.
• Default Markup Percentage. Suppose you’re an interior decorator and you 
mark up the furniture and bric-a-brac you sell by a standard percentage. When 
you specify your markup percentage in this box and then create a new item 
(page 106), QuickBooks calculates the item’s sales price based on its cost. For 
example, if you create an inventory part for a black leather sofa and enter its 
cost as $10,000, a 20 percent markup results in a sales price of $12,000. If you 
charge a different markup on only a few of the things you sell, then simply 
modify the sales prices that QuickBooks calculates.
• Default Markup Account. To assign the income from your markup percentage 
to a specific account, select it in this drop-down list. You can choose an account 
dedicated to markup income or simply assign markup to your product-related 
income account.

CHAPTER

M
ost companies use other programs in addition to QuickBooks to keep their 
businesses running smoothly. For example, you can use QuickBooks data 
in other programs to study your company’s financial ratios, calculate em­
ployee bonuses based on services sold, send special sales letters to customers on 
their birthdays, and so on. Similarly, other programs may contain data that would 
be useful to pull into QuickBooks. For example, if you use an estimating program 
that has all the products and services you sell in its database, there’s no reason to 
manually enter that info in QuickBooks.
QuickBooks doesn’t share its most intimate details with just any program. It re­
serves its data for a few select programs—or the ones you tell it to play nicely with. 
For example, you can set up letters in QuickBooks to send to customers, and the 
program automatically opens Microsoft Word with your customer data merged into 
form letters and envelopes. And if you manage contacts with Microsoft Outlook 
(not Outlook Express), keeping records up to date is easy. By synchronizing your 
QuickBooks company file and your contact database, you enter changes in one place 
and both programs automatically reflect the updates.
Programs that can read a QuickBooks company file still have to ask permission to 
grab QuickBooks data. The QuickBooks administrator (or other QuickBooks users 
whom the administrator anoints) can say whether another program can have access 
and how much. And for software that can’t read a company file directly but can 
provide valuable assistance processing your financial data (such as Excel, whose 
spreadsheets can calculate financial ratios that QuickBooks can’t), you can export 
and import data between programs as described starting on page 684.

MAIL MERGE 
TO A WORD 
DOCUMENT
This chapter describes how to integrate QuickBooks at whatever level of trust you 
prefer. It also tells you about add-on services that Intuit provides and how to find 
third-party programs that work with QuickBooks.
Mail Merge to a Word Document
Business communications are the perfect marriage of QuickBooks data and word 
processing. You can generate letters and envelopes in no time by combining Quick­
Books’ customer or vendor contact info and other data with Microsoft Word mail-
merge documents. QuickBooks includes dozens of ready-to-mail Word documents 
that cover the most common business communications, from customer thank-you 
notes to less-friendly denials of requests for credit. And if nothing less than Pulitzer 
Prize quality will do for your business letters, you can modify the built-in letters and 
envelopes in Word or write your own.
When you want to prepare letters in QuickBooks, the best way to start is by choosing 
Company→“Prepare Letters with Envelopes,” which displays a submenu with the 
following categories (each of which includes several letter templates):
• Collection Letters include the invoices or statements that are overdue, and 
remind customers to pay up. QuickBooks automatically pulls the overdue bal­
ance and overdue invoices from your company file.
• Customer Letters pull the customer’s contact and address information from 
QuickBooks to address the letter and envelope. The rest of the letter is boiler­
plate for situations such as thanking customers for their business, apologizing 
for a mistake, or sending a contract.
• Vendor Letters include credit requests, disputed charges, payments on your 
account, and two blank templates for sending mail or a fax to a vendor.
• Employee Letters cover birthdays, sick time, vacations, and general com­
munications.
• Letters to Other Names cover a hodgepodge of different recipients, so Quick-
Books doesn’t even try to guess what you need. The only template in this 
category is a blank letter with basic mail merge fields.
• Customize Letter Templates is a feature that helps you create a brand-new 
template, convert a Word document into a template, edit an existing template, 
or organize the templates you already have, as described in the box on page 673.
 NOTE 	 The first time you choose one of the items on the Company→“Prepare Letters with Envelopes” 
submenu, QuickBooks may tell you it can’t find the preinstalled letter templates in your company file folder. In 
that case, it asks if you want to copy its built-in templates. Click Copy to create copies of the built-in templates in 
the folder with your company file. (If you store letter templates in another folder on your computer, click Browse 
to choose that folder.)

Customizing Letter Templates
To create, edit, or otherwise manage custom letter templates, 
choose Company→“Prepare Letters with Envelopes”→ 
Customize Letter Templates. Then, in the “Letters and Enve-
lopes” wizard’s window, choose one of these options:
• Create a New Letter Template From Scratch. When you 
choose this option, you can specify the type of letter you 
want to create and the name of the template. QuickBooks 
then sends a blank letter template to Word and adds a 
special toolbar to Word (see Figure 26-1). In addition to 
writing the content of the letter, you can add fields from 
QuickBooks to automatically fill in your company and 
customer (or other recipient) info.
• Convert an Existing Microsoft Word Document to a Letter 
Template. This option lets you use an existing Word 
document as the basis for a new template. Once you 
specify the type of letter, you can then add more text or 
QuickBooks fields to the document as if you were creating 
a new template from scratch.
• View or Edit Existing Letter Templates. You can open and 
edit any existing template.
• Organize Existing Letter Templates. When you choose this 
option, you can navigate through each template category, 
choose a template, and then delete, duplicate, rename, 
or move it to a different category.
QuickBooks stores the Word documents for letter templates in 
a document folder. In Windows 7 and 8, the templates are in 
C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\Intuit\QuickBooks\Company 
Files\QuickBooks Letter Templates. There’s a subfolder for each 
category of template (Collections Letters, Customer Letters, 
and so on).

Creating Letters and Envelopes in QuickBooks
Preparing any kind of letter with QuickBooks’ letter wizard takes no more than a few 
clicks, and the collection letter wizard has some extra smarts. For most letters, you 
can tell QuickBooks whether you want to include active and/or inactive names, and 
then select recipients. The collection letter wizard can also filter the Customer:Job 
List by how late payments are.

Here are the steps for creating letters and envelopes using a collection letter as an 
example:
1.	 Choose Company→“Prepare Letters with Envelopes”→Collection Letters.
QuickBooks opens the “Letters and Envelopes” wizard and shows the recipient 
options for collection letters.
2.	 Choose options to select who you want to send letters to (Figure 26-2).
QuickBooks remembers the options you choose and selects them automatically 
the next time you launch this wizard.
 NOTE 	 For non-collection letters, you still choose active or inactive customers (or both) and whether to send 
letters to each customer or each job, but those are your only choices. For a recall notice, for example, choose 
the Both option to send the letter to active and inactive customers alike. (The first screen you see for letters to 
vendors, employees, and people on the Other Names List combines the list of selected names and the options 
for filtering names.)
FIGURE 26-2
For collection letters, on the “Choose the 
Recipients” screen, QuickBooks initially 
selects the Both option to include active and 
inactive customers. 
The next set of options on this screen lets 
you choose whether to send a letter to each 
customer or to the contact person for each 
job a customer hires you to do. For collection 
letters, the third set of options asks you 
to specify how late the payment has to be 
before you send a letter.
3.	 Click Next to display the “Review and Edit Recipients” screen.
For collection letters, QuickBooks displays a message if any customers have 
unapplied credits or payments. Rather than embarrassing yourself by sending 
a collection letter to a customer whose payments are up to date, you’re best off 
clicking OK to close the message box and then clicking Cancel to exit the wizard 
so you can apply credits and payments before preparing collection letters. (The 
box on page 677 explains how to check for customer credits and payments.)

Chapter 26: Integrating QuickBooks with Other Programs
675
MAIL MERGE 
TO A WORD 
DOCUMENT
If there aren’t any unapplied credits or payments, QuickBooks automatically 
selects all the names that match the criteria you specified on the previous screen.
4.	 If you’ve already talked to some customers and want to remove them from 
the list, click the checkmarks in front of their names to turn them off.
You can click Mark All or Unmark All to select or clear every name. If you want 
only a few names, it’s faster to click Unmark All and then click each name you 
want. The list is initially sorted by name, but for collection letters you can also 
select the Amount option to sort by the amount that’s overdue if you want to 
send letters only to customers whose balances are greater than, say, $100.
5.	 When you’ve selected the customers you want to send letters to, click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Choose a Letter Template screen.
6.	 Select the collection letter template you want to use, and then click Next.
QuickBooks includes three types of collection letters. The formal one is a 
straightforward request for payment, the friendly one assumes the customer 
simply forgot, and the harsh one includes the threat of turning the account over 
to a collection agency. The friendly and formal letters can’t do any harm, but 
if you’re considering sending harsh letters, you might want to create your own 
template for that communication.
To use a different template entirely, select the “Create or Edit a letter template” 
option. When you click Next, you can choose one of the options described in 
the box on page 673 (create a new template, convert a Word document, or edit 
an existing template).
7.	 In the “Enter a Name and Title” screen’s Name box, type the name you 
want to include in the letter’s signature block. In the Title box, type the 
signer’s title.
When you click Next, QuickBooks sends the information to Microsoft Word, as 
shown in Figure 26-3. It also displays the “Print Letters and Envelopes” screen 
in the Letters and Envelopes wizard, but you aren’t ready for that screen just 
yet. Depending on how many letters you’re sending, you might have to wait a 
few minutes before Word launches with your letters.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks warns you if there’s any info missing, like a recipient’s address. If there is, you can enter it 
in Word or close the Word document, add the missing info to QuickBooks, and then redo the steps in this section.
8.	 After you print the letters from Word, go back to QuickBooks. On the “Print 
Letters and Envelopes” screen, click Next if you want to print envelopes 
that go with the letters you just printed in Word.
If you don’t want to print envelopes, click Cancel. The wizard closes and you’re 
done.

UP TO SPEED
Reviewing Customer Credits and Payments
The Open Invoices report shows unapplied credits and pay-
ments as well as open invoices, but you can modify this report 
to show only the payments and unapplied credits that are avail-
able. That way, you can apply those payments and credits to 
your customers’ balances (as explained on page 345 and page 
350, respectively) so that, when you create collection letters, 
QuickBooks selects only the customers with overdue balances.
Here’s how to produce a report of payments and unapplied 
credits:
1.	 Choose Reports→Customers & Receivables→Open 
Invoices.
2.	 To see only unapplied credits and payments, in the 
report window’s toolbar, click Customize Report, and 
then click the Filters tab. (If the Modify Report dialog 
box opens automatically, simply click its Filters tab.) 
3.	 In the Filter list on the left, choose Transaction Type (you 
may have to scroll down to see this option).
4.	 In the Transaction Type drop-down list, choose Multiple 
Transaction Types.
5.	 In the Select Transaction Types dialog box, click Payment, 
and then click Credit Memo.
6.	 Click OK to close the Select Transaction Types dialog box, 
and then click OK in the Modify Report dialog box to 
update the report to show only unapplied credit memos 
and payments.
For a quick view of one customer’s transactions, open the 
Customer Center (on the Home Page, click Customers) and select 
the customer on the Customers & Jobs tab. Then, at the top right 
of the Customer Information panel, click the QuickReport link.
Synchronizing Contacts
If you keep information about contacts in Microsoft Outlook (2007 through 2013)—
not Outlook Express—you can use a tool called Contact Sync to synchronize those 
records with your QuickBooks contact data. In addition to saving time by not having 
to enter data twice, synchronizing your contact info also helps reduce errors. As long 
as you enter an update correctly in one program, you’re sure to get the right info 
in your other contact database. Regardless of which program you update contact 
info in, you can transfer any changes to the other database.
 NOTE 	 The only time synchronizing doesn’t apply is when you delete contacts. So if you delete contacts in 
Outlook, for example, QuickBooks doesn’t delete the corresponding records in your company file. (If you really 
want those records gone, make them inactive, as described on page 90.) On the other hand, if you delete a contact 
in QuickBooks but don’t delete it in Outlook, it’ll reappear in QuickBooks unless you tell Contact Sync to ignore it 
(see step 11 on page 680).
Using QuickBooks Contact Sync for Outlook
If you use Outlook 2007 or later, QuickBooks’ Contact Sync for Outlook tool can help 
you synchronize contact data. (Contact Sync works only with the 32-bit versions 
of Outlook 2010 and 2013.) Although the menu item for synchronizing appears in

QuickBooks’ File→Utilities submenu automatically, you have to install Contact Sync 
before you can get started.
 NOTE 	 When this book was being written in the summer of 2014, Contact Sync for Outlook didn’t work 
with Outlook 2013. The following instructions should work if you’re using an earlier version of Outlook, and 
hopefully with Outlook 2013 by the time you read this. For updates, see this book’s Missing CD page at www.
missingmanuals/cds.
Here’s how to download this tool and put it to work:
1.	 Choose File→Utilities→Synchronize Contacts.
If Contact Sync isn’t installed, a message box tells you that you have to download 
and install it. Click OK to do just that. QuickBooks opens a browser window to 
the QuickBooks Contact Sync for Outlook page (http://support.quickbooks.
intuit.com/support/tools/contact_sync). Below the Download heading, type 
the email address you used when you registered QuickBooks (page 740), and 
then click Continue To Download. You can save the installation file (click Save) 
or run it immediately (click Run) to install the software.
Installing is easy. Run the installation wizard as you do for other programs. Ac­
cept the license agreement, choose a destination folder, and then click Next, 
and the installation begins. You may have to restart your computer after the 
installation finishes.
2.	 After you install Contact Sync, launch Outlook.
Contact Sync features appear on Outlook’s Add-Ins tab.
3.	 In QuickBooks, log in as the administrator and open the company file you 
want to synchronize.
4.	 In Outlook, click the Add-Ins tab, and then click Synchronize Contacts.
A Connecting To QuickBooks message box appears briefly while Outlook and 
QuickBooks talk to each other. Then the QuickBooks Contact Sync dialog box 
opens and selects the company file that’s open in QuickBooks.
 NOTE 	 If you want to import contacts from a different company file, click Cancel and then, in QuickBooks, 
open the company file with the contacts you want to import.
5.	 In the QuickBooks Contact Sync dialog box, click Setup to begin the setup 
in earnest.
The Select An Outlook Folder screen appears. If you’re like most people, you 
have only one folder for contacts, named something like \\Personal Folders\
Contacts or \\Outlook\Contacts, which the wizard selects automatically.

11.	 On the Set Conflict Action screen, select how you want Contact Sync to re­
solve discrepancies between Outlook and QuickBooks, and then click Save.
Contact Sync automatically selects the “Let me decide each case” option, which 
means you get to tell QuickBooks what to do if the contact info in Outlook differs 
from the data in QuickBooks. If you usually update contacts in Outlook, select 
the Outlook Data Wins option. If you usually update contacts in QuickBooks, 
select the QuickBooks Data Wins option instead.
12.	 On the “Change Settings or Synchronize Now” screen, if you want to change 
any settings, click Setup (you’ll retrace your steps until you’re back at this 
screen). If you’re ready to synchronize, click Sync Now.
The Contact Sync screen keeps you updated on the progress it’s making. When 
the synchronization is done, the Contact Overview Complete screen appears, 
showing you how many customers and vendors it found and either matched 
or added to Outlook.
13.	 When you’re done reviewing the Contact Overview Complete screen, click 
Next.
If contacts that already existed in Outlook don’t match up to a QuickBooks 
list (like Customer or Vendor), the “Select Categories for QuickBooks” screen 
appears. You can add an Outlook contact to a QuickBooks list by selecting the 
contact, choosing the appropriate QuickBooks list in the “Select list for contact” 
drop-down menu, and then clicking Apply.
If the contacts don’t match up to a QuickBooks list because they aren’t business 
contacts, you can tell Contact Sync to ignore them. Click the first contact, and 
then Shift-click the last contact to select them all. Then, in the “Select list for 
contact” drop-down menu, choose Ignore, and then click Apply.
After you’ve selected the QuickBooks lists for your Outlook contacts, click Next.
14.	 On the Accept Changes screen, review the changes that will occur in Outlook 
and QuickBooks. If you don’t want to make the changes, click Cancel. If the 
changes are OK, click Accept.
A progress box shows you where Contact Sync is in transferring data. The Syn­
chronization Complete message box appears when your info is synchronized. 
Click OK and you’re done.
From now on, you can update contact information with just one click. In Outlook, 
on the Add-Ins tab, click Synchronize Contacts to make Contact Sync analyze the 
changes in the two programs and update both as necessary.

WORKING 
WITH OTHER 
APPS
Working with Other Apps
Because QuickBooks is so popular, Intuit and plenty of other companies offer pro­
grams to fill the niches that QuickBooks doesn’t handle—or doesn’t handle the way 
you want. For example, QuickBooks Pro and Premier’s inventory-tracking feature 
offers only average cost inventory (page 536), so many users turn to third-party 
inventory applications for LIFO (last in/first out) and FIFO (first in/first out) costing. 
Estimating is another example, and there are a gazillion more. Third-party software 
developers can build products that integrate with QuickBooks by using Intuit’s 
software development kit (SDK). And Intuit offers quite a few add-ons of its own. 
This section describes how to find applications that meet your needs and how to 
set them up to play nicely with QuickBooks.
Finding Add-On Apps
Intuit and other companies offer scads of business services and add-on apps you 
can purchase. The price might be worthwhile when you take into account the cost of 
your employees’ time or—far more valuable—you being able to relax on weekends 
instead of catching up on company paperwork. You can find many of these add-ons 
right within QuickBooks. If you don’t find what you’re looking for there, you might 
have more luck on the Intuit App Center website (http://apps.intuit.com) or Intuit 
Marketplace website (http://marketplace.intuit.com).
Here’s some info about places you can look for add-on apps and services:
• QuickBooks’ windows promote services that relate to the task you’re perform­
ing. For example, click Receive Payments on the QuickBooks Home Page, and 
the Receive Payments window’s Main tab displays an icon labeled Add Credit 
Card Processing. You can also access Intuit’s offerings by choosing Help→Add 
QuickBooks Services.
• At the bottom of the left icon bar (page 30), the section labeled Do More with 
QuickBooks lists several Intuit services, including payroll, credit card process­
ing, and ordering supplies.
• The Intuit App Center (http://appcenter.intuit.com) is a one-stop shop for 
apps that work with QuickBooks: Intuit and third-party apps, web-based apps, 
mobile apps, and more. You can get to it from within QuickBooks by going to 
the Home Page’s Company panel and clicking the “Web and Mobile Apps” icon, 
or by choosing Help→“App Center: Find More Business Solutions.”
• The Intuit Marketplace (http://marketplace.intuit.com) catalogs thousands of 
third-party desktop and web-based programs that work with QuickBooks data, 
most of which offer free trials that last from 30 to 90 days. Programs listed in 
the Marketplace share data with QuickBooks but target different industries or 
services. Sure, Intuit sells Premier editions of QuickBooks for a few industries (see 
page xix), but the Marketplace offers additional software for those industries, 
as well as customized accounting solutions for industries like agriculture, hotels 
and restaurants, transportation, and utilities. For example, the Construction/

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
682
WORKING 
WITH OTHER 
APPS
Contractors section has programs that produce estimates and generate docu­
ments that conform to industry association standards—while still sharing data 
with your QuickBooks company file.
The Intuit Marketplace site lists third-party programs in two ways: by industry 
and by business function. For example, if you’re looking for contact-management 
software, you don’t have to navigate every industry link looking for programs. 
Below the Find Apps heading, click By Business Need and then, in the list that 
appears, choose Customer Management (CRM).
You can also refine your search for applications that are compatible with your 
edition of QuickBooks. After you select a category you’re interested in on the 
main Marketplace page, click the down arrow to the right of the Check Product 
Compatibility box, and then choose the edition you use: Pro, Premier, Enterprise, 
Canada, and so on.
• If you use Google to search for basic terms like “QuickBooks third-party appli­
cation,” you’ll get tons of results. Of course, if you focus your search (by adding 
“medical office,” for example) you can narrow the results. And, if you use all of 
the 10 keywords that you can enter in a Google search to describe the Quick­
Books add-ons you seek, you might get a few dozen links worth investigating.
• Try searching websites like Download.com (www.download.com) using “Quick­
Books” as a keyword. Download.com has dozens of programs that work with 
QuickBooks, some of which aren’t industry-based at all but are still incredibly 
valuable. For example, you can download an app that lets you transfer transac­
tion data from Excel to your QuickBooks company file.
 TIP 	 Before you let a third-party program loose on your QuickBooks company file, you need to check it out. 
Does it work with your computer’s operating system and your network? Does it have the features you need? Is 
it easy to use? Does it come with helpful documentation? If it meets all those criteria, you should still take a few 
safety measures before starting to use it: Back up your company file and any ancillary files. Store the backup on 
a CD, DVD, or thumb drive, so you can’t overwrite it by mistake. Then make a copy of your company file specifi­
cally for your test. If the third-party program doesn’t pass the test, you can uninstall it and go back to using your 
regular company file.
Setting Up an Integrated App
Integrated applications don’t read data from exported text files; they actually access 
your company file to get info. To protect your data from programs that shouldn’t 
read your company file, you have to tell QuickBooks which programs you do want 
digging into your financial data.
Letting programs access your data is something you set up with QuickBooks prefer­
ences. In QuickBooks, choose Edit→Preferences→Integrated Applications, and then 
click the Company Preferences tab (Figure 26-5). There you can turn on the “Don’t 
allow any applications to access this company file” checkbox to keep all programs out. 
But if you’re reading this section, you probably want at least one program to access 

Chapter 26: Integrating QuickBooks with Other Programs
683
WORKING 
WITH OTHER 
APPS
your QuickBooks data, so leave that checkbox turned off. If you want QuickBooks 
to tell you when an application’s certificate has expired turn on the—you guessed 
it—“Notify the user before running any application whose certificate has expired” 
checkbox. An expired certificate doesn’t mean the application has changed, so you 
may choose to leave the checkbox turned off to bypass the warnings. 
FIGURE 26-5
Only the QuickBooks 
administrator can give 
programs access rights. 
To learn more about 
how integrated apps 
work with QuickBooks, 
click the “Learn about 
applications that integrate 
with QuickBooks” link 
shown here. When you do 
that, a browser window 
opens to a support page 
that describes Intuit 
Sync Manager, a feature 
that synchronizes your 
QuickBooks data with 
Intuit’s online services and 
third-party apps you use.
As long as the “Don’t allow any applications to access this company file” checkbox is 
turned off, when a program tries to access your company file, QuickBooks displays 
an Application Certificate dialog box. If you’re the QuickBooks administrator or have 
permission to dole out file access, choose one of the dialog box’s options to set the 
program’s access to the company file. Obviously, choosing No keeps the program 
out. But if you want to let the program in, you have three options to choose from:
• Yes, prompt each time. When you’re letting another program access your data, 
this is the safest option. The program can get in only when someone with the 
rights to approve access says so—a small obstacle that prevents someone from 
breaking in and running the program after hours. If no one who can approve 
access is available to say yes, the integrated application (or the person who’s 
running it) is out of luck.
• Yes, whenever this QuickBooks company file is open. This option is a bit more 
trusting. As long as someone is working on the company file, the integrated 
application can access the file without asking permission.
• Yes, always allow access even if QuickBooks is not running. This is by far the 
most lenient choice. The integrated program can help itself to your financial 
data even if no one with a QuickBooks login is working on the file. This option 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
684
EXPORTING 
QUICKBOOKS 
DATA
is exactly what you need if the integrated application is a resource hog that 
you run at night.
When you choose this option, you can specify that the application be a Quick­
Books user and that it must log in. Rather than use one of your employee’s logins, 
create a separate QuickBooks user (page 722) specifically for that integrated 
application. That way, you can control the type of data the program can access 
without affecting anyone else’s login, and the Audit Trail report (page 437) 
shows the changes the application makes.
 TIP 	 Name the user after the third-party application. For example, call the user Fishbowl if you’re setting it 
up for the Fishbowl inventory app.
After a program has accessed your company file, you can change its access rights 
in the Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 26-6.
FIGURE 26-6
To change an inte-
grated application’s access 
rights, on the Company 
Preferences tab, select the 
application, and then click 
the Properties button. 
In the Properties dialog 
box that appears, you 
can turn checkboxes on 
and off to remove access 
or change the level of 
access the program has. 
The Details tab shows 
the program’s name, the 
company that developed 
it, its version, and its 
certificate.
Exporting QuickBooks Data
Programs that don’t integrate with QuickBooks can still do things that QuickBooks 
can’t. For example, you can export a report to Excel and take advantage of that 
program’s wider range of calculations and formatting options. To get data out of 
your QuickBooks company file and into another program, you have three choices:

Chapter 26: Integrating QuickBooks with Other Programs
685
EXPORTING 
QUICKBOOKS 
DATA
• Export file. You can create a delimited text file (a file that separates each field 
with a delimiter like a comma or a tab) that contains data from your QuickBooks 
file. For example, you can generate export files for QuickBooks lists, such as 
the Item List. For QuickBooks records with contact info, like your Customer:Job 
and Vendor lists, you can produce export files that contain all the contact info 
or only addresses.
• Report file. You can export any QuickBooks report to a file that you can use 
in another program. Compared with exporting a list in its entirety, this option 
gives you more control over how much information you export. If you want 
to export data from specific customers, specific data from several lists, from 
transactions, or from specific fields, exporting reports is your only choice. By 
creating a customized version of the Customer Contact List report or Vendor 
Contact List report (see page 690), for example, you can export the same set 
of records repeatedly, creating delimited files, spreadsheets, and so on. Chapter 
23 covers QuickBooks’ reports in detail.
• Excel file. This option is ideal if you’re not sure what info you need and you’d 
rather delete and rearrange columns in a spreadsheet program. Throughout 
QuickBooks, you can get to the same Export dialog box that you see when 
you export reports. For example, at the bottom of the Item List window, click 
Excel→Export All Items. In the Customer Center’s menu bar, click Excel, and 
then choose either Export Customer List or Export Transactions. (The Vendor 
Center and the Employee Center have similar features.) You can then edit the 
spreadsheet in Excel all you want and transfer the data to yet another program 
when you’re done. The box on page 687 explains how to use Excel to view your 
QuickBooks data.
The following sections explain all your options.
Exporting Lists and Addresses
When you export QuickBooks lists as delimited text files, the export file (called an 
IIF file because of its .iif file extension, which stands for “Intuit interchange format”) 
contains values from all the fields associated with those lists. Creating export files 
is easy—the only choice you have to make is which list(s) to export, and then Quick-
Books creates an IIF file that contains every field for every list you chose.
EXPORTING LISTS TO A TEXT FILE
Exporting one or more lists to a delimited text file involves only a few quick steps:
1.	 Choose File→Utilities→Export→Lists to IIF Files.
QuickBooks opens an Export dialog box that contains checkboxes for each list 
in QuickBooks, as shown in Figure 26-7.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
686
EXPORTING 
QUICKBOOKS 
DATA
FIGURE 26-7
Turning on a checkbox tells QuickBooks that you 
want to export all the records in that list. 
If you turn on more than one checkbox, the data for 
every list you choose ends up in a single export file.
2.	 Turn on the checkbox for every list you want to export into the same file, 
and then click OK.
If you want to export lists into separate files, repeat these steps for each export 
file you want to create. For example, if you want to export your Customer:Job 
List and your Item List to two different files, repeat these steps twice through.
3.	 In the second Export dialog box (which is basically a Save As dialog box), 
navigate to the folder where you want to save the export file and, in the 
“File name” box, type a name for the file.
Your export files are easier to find if you create a folder specifically for them. 
For example, you could create a subfolder called Export_Files within the folder 
that holds your company files.
4.	 Click Save to create the file.
When the QuickBooks Information message box tells you that your data was 
exported successfully, click OK to close the message box. Now you’re ready to 
import the file into Microsoft Excel or another program (page 687).
 TIP 	 Exporting QuickBooks data can help you learn the format you need to import data into your company 
file, as described on page 132. For example, the easiest way to create new budgets is to set them up in an Excel 
workbook (page 568).
EXPORTING ADDRESSES
Because QuickBooks has features that generate mail-merge letters, export contact 
list reports, and synchronize your company file with Outlook, you may not need the

tab-delimited address files that QuickBooks produces. However, if you need a text 
file of names and addresses to import into another program, here’s what you do:
1.	 Choose File→Utilities→Export→Addresses to Text File.
The “Select Names for Export Addresses” dialog box opens.
2.	 In the “Select Names to be exported to your Address data file” drop-down 
list, choose the category of names you want to export, and then click OK.
Initially, QuickBooks chooses “All names” to export all the names in your com­
pany file. You can also choose categories of names, like “All vendors.” To select 
individual names, choose “Multiple names,” and then pick the ones you want.
3.	 In the Save Address Data File dialog box, select a folder where you want 
to save the exported file, type a filename in the “File name” box, and then 
click Save.
QuickBooks automatically assigns the file a .txt extension. You can now import 
it into any program that can handle tab-delimited addresses, such as Excel (see 
the box below).
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
The Easy Way to View Data
Data is easier to examine when you view an export or import 
file with a spreadsheet program like Excel. Most programs 
can open or import delimited text files, but Excel is a master 
at reading the records stored in these text files and displaying 
them clearly.
When you export data to a delimited text file and then open it 
in Excel, the program puts the data into cells in a spreadsheet. 
Because records and fields appear in neat rows and columns, 
respectively, you can quickly identify, select, and edit the 
data you want. Furthermore, you can eliminate entire rows or 
columns with a few deft clicks or keystrokes.
Here’s how to open a delimited text file with Excel:
1.	 In Excel, choose File→Open.
2.	 The delimited text files won’t appear in the Open dialog 
box at first because they’re not Excel files. Delimited 
text files come with a range of file extensions (the three 
characters that follow the last period in the filename), so 
choose All Files in the file-type drop-down list to make 
sure you’ll see your delimited file listed.
3.	 To open the file, navigate to the folder where it’s saved, 
and then double-click the file’s name. The Text Import 
Wizard dialog box appears. 
4.	 On the first screen, Excel automatically selects the 
Delimited option, which is what you want, so click Next. On 
the second screen, Excel turns on the Tab checkbox, which 
is also what you want if you’re opening a QuickBooks IIF 
file, so click Next again.
5.	 On the third screen, click a column to select it, and then in 
the “Column data format” section at the top of the dialog 
box, select the type of data that column represents. Excel 
initially selects the General option, which works for most 
data. If a column contains text, select the Text option; for 
dates, select the Date option, and then choose the date 
format you want in the drop-down list to the option’s 
right. To skip the column, select the “Do not import column 
(skip)” option instead.
6.	 The “Data preview” table at the bottom of the dialog box 
shows you what the data will look like after it’s imported 
into Excel. When its interpretation of the data is correct, 
click Finish.
Now you can use Excel to rename column headings or delete 
the columns or rows you don’t want to import.

Exporting Reports
As you learned in Chapter 23, you can customize reports so they contain exactly 
the information you want, presented just the way you want. When you want to 
export only some QuickBooks data or export it in a specific way, your best bet is to 
customize a report and then export it.
If the program you want to import the report data into is fussy about data formats, 
export the report to Excel, where it’s easier to make changes than in a text-editing 
tool such as Windows Notepad. You can also export a report to a comma-delimited 
file if that’s what another program needs. Exporting reports is an effective way to 
extract some QuickBooks lists like the Item List, Customer:Job List, Vendor List, and 
Employee List. Here are the different ways you can use this technique:
• Running a report. Start by running the report you want to export (page 580). 
Then, in the report window, click Excel→Create New Worksheet. The “Send 
Report to Excel” dialog box that appears lets you choose the file and options 
for the export, as shown in Figure 26-8.
• From the Item List window. Open the Item List window (on the Home Page, 
click the Items & Services icon) and then, at the bottom of the list window, click 
Excel→Export All Items. QuickBooks opens the Export dialog box, which has 
options similar to the ones you see when you export a report (Figure 26-8).
FIGURE 26-8
When you create an Excel workbook by export-
ing a report, QuickBooks automatically includes 
a worksheet in it with tips for working with the 
resulting Excel worksheet. 
If you don’t need help with Excel, click the 
Advanced button shown here and then, in the 
Advanced Excel Options dialog box, turn off the 
“Include QuickBooks Export Guide worksheet 
with helpful advice” checkbox.
• From a QuickBooks center. In the Customer Center’s menu bar, click Excel, 
and then choose Export Customer List or Export Transactions. In the Vendor 
Center or Employee Center, choose Export Vendor List or Export Employee 
List, respectively.

Chapter 26: Integrating QuickBooks with Other Programs
689
EXPORTING 
QUICKBOOKS 
DATA
Regardless of whether the Export dialog box or the “Send Report to Excel” dialog 
box opens, you can choose the same basic options for where you want to save the 
exported report:
• The Create new worksheet option creates a brand-new Excel worksheet for 
the report. If you choose Excel→Create New Worksheet in a report window, the 
“Create new worksheet” and “in new workbook” options are selected, which 
means QuickBooks will create a new Excel workbook with a worksheet for the 
exported data, as shown in Figure 26-9. If you export a list and the Export dialog 
box appears, selecting the “Create new worksheet” option also displays the “in 
new workbook” and “in existing workbook” options so you can create a new 
worksheet in an existing file or a brand-new one.
FIGURE 26-9
When you export a report 
to Excel, the data in the 
report’s columns and rows 
appear in columns and 
rows in the worksheet. If a 
report subtotals numbers, 
the workbook uses Excel’s 
SUM function to add up the 
workbook cells that make 
up the subtotal. 
If you choose the “Update 
an existing worksheet” 
option, QuickBooks can 
update values in an exist-
ing worksheet without 
overwriting most of the 
edits you’ve made.
• The Update an existing worksheet option exports the report to an existing 
worksheet in an existing file. This option is ideal if you’re planning to calculate 
ratios and want to update that worksheet to include your most recent financial 
numbers. When you select this option, the “Select workbook” box appears 
so you can choose the file and worksheet you want to update. (If you choose 
Excel→Update Existing Worksheet in a report window, the “Send Report to 
Excel” dialog box opens with this option selected.)
• The Replace an existing worksheet option exports the report to an existing 
worksheet and replaces the contents of that worksheet. In the “Select work­
book” box, choose the file and then specify the worksheet you want to replace.
• The Create a comma separated values (.csv) file option creates a comma-
delimited file that you can use with programs that can read files formatted 
that way.

 TIP 	 The Advanced button in the Export and “Send Report to Excel” dialog boxes opens the Advanced Excel 
Options dialog box, which lets you set the formatting you want to transfer from QuickBooks to Excel, choose which 
Excel features you want the workbook to use (like AutoFit to size the columns to display all the data), and select 
where you want the report’s header info displayed.
After you’ve selected the type of export file and other options, click Export. Quick­
Books launches Excel and copies the data in the report to the Excel workbook you 
specified, placing the data from the report’s columns into the worksheet’s columns, 
as shown in Figure 26-9.
CUSTOMIZED EXPORTS USING CONTACT LIST REPORTS
Exporting the entire Customer:Job or Vendor list is overkill when all you want are 
the contacts’ names and email addresses; that’s where exporting a report shines. By 
modifying the settings in the Customer Contact List report or the Vendor Contact 
List report, you can export exactly the fields you want for specific customers or 
vendors. For example, storing email addresses in QuickBooks is perfect when you 
email invoices to customers, but you probably also want these addresses in your 
email program so you can communicate with customers about the work you’re 
doing for them.
Out of the box, QuickBooks’ Customer Contact List report includes Customer, Bill to, 
Primary Contact, Main Phone, Fax, and Balance Total columns. The Vendor Contact 
List report includes Vendor, Account No., Bill from, Primary Contact, Main Phone, 
Fax, and Balance Total columns. Here’s how you transform these reports into an 
export tool, using the Customer Contact List as an example:
1.	 Choose Reports→List→Customer Contact List.
The Customer Contact List report window opens. (For the Vendor Contact List, 
choose Reports→List→Vendor Contact List instead.)
2.	 In the report window’s toolbar, click Customize Report.
The Modify Report dialog box that appears lets you adjust the report to filter 
the data that you’ll export. (See page 589 to learn about other ways of custom­
izing reports.)
3.	 Click the dialog box’s Display tab (if you’re not already on it) and, in the 
Columns section, choose the fields you want to export.
The Customer, Primary Contact, Main Phone, and Fax fields might be good ones 
to export. Then again, they might not. You can add or remove whichever fields 
you want by clicking a field’s name in the Columns list to toggle that field on 
or off. If there’s a checkmark in front of the field’s name, the report will include 
a column for that field.
4.	 To produce a report for only the customers you want, click the dialog box’s 
Filters tab. In the Filter list on the left, choose Customer. In the Customer 
drop-down list that appears, choose “Multiple customers/jobs.”

customer you want to export, and then click OK. Then, in the Modify Report 
dialog box, click OK.
You see the report with the modifications you’ve made.
 TIP 	 Saving the modified report you just created reduces the number of steps you have to take the next time 
you export. Page 601 explains how to memorize a report.
6.	 In the Customer Contact List report window’s toolbar, click Excel→Create 
New Worksheet.
The “Send Report to Excel” dialog box opens. To create a new Excel workbook, 
keep the “Create new worksheet” option selected and click Export. Your com­
puter launches Excel and displays the report in a workbook.
Importing Data from Other Programs
Importing data from other programs comes in handy mostly for generating lists in 
QuickBooks. However, you can also import data to generate your chart of accounts 
or to load different versions of your company budget. The biggest requirement for 
importing data is that the files have to be either Excel workbooks (.xls or .xlsx files) or 
delimited text files (which separate each piece of information with commas or tabs).
If you’re familiar with importing Excel spreadsheets into other programs, importing 
them into QuickBooks is a snap. In fact, QuickBooks includes several Excel import 
templates that walk you through getting your Excel data for customers, vendors, 
and items into the format that QuickBooks requires. 
If you’re importing a Customer:Job List, Vendor List, or Item List, don’t even think 
about importing it as a delimited file. It’s much easier to open that kind of file in 
Excel and then use the QuickBooks’ Excel import templates. Page 133 provides the 
full story on using these templates.
But if you want to import other kinds of lists or a budget, using a delimited file works 
just fine. The following section shows you how.
Importing a Delimited File
With a delimited file, QuickBooks needs to know the kind of data you’re importing—
and it learns that from special keywords for row and column headers. (Keywords 
are strings of characters in a delimited text file that identify QuickBooks’ records 
and fields.)

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
692
IMPORTING 
DATA FROM 
OTHER 
PROGRAMS
Before you import data from another program into a QuickBooks list, you need to 
know the correct keywords for the fields you’re importing. The easiest way to see the 
keywords for a list is to export that list from QuickBooks and examine the keywords 
at the beginning of the rows and at the tops of the columns.
Deciphering keywords requires a smattering of computerese. For example, when 
you see the column heading “Billing Address,” you know instantly what kind of in­
formation you’re looking at. But the only way QuickBooks recognizes the first line 
of a billing address is from the keyword BADDR1.
Figure 26-10 shows a delimited file in an Excel spreadsheet. (Even though the de­
limited file is a text file, viewing it in Excel makes the fields easier to read than they 
would be in a text editor like Notepad, as described in the box on page 687.) Here’s 
the layout of a delimited file that QuickBooks can read:
• QuickBooks list keyword. In the first cell in the first row of a list, an exclamation 
point in front of the keyword tells QuickBooks that the data in the rows that 
follow is for that list. For example, !CUST (labeled 1 in Figure 26-10) represents 
data for the Customer:Job List.
• Field names. Keywords in the other cells of the same row specify QuickBooks 
field names, like cell B36 in Figure 26-10 (which is labeled 2). In that cell, the 
keyword NAME identifies the values in that column as the name of each cus­
tomer. In cell F36, BADDR2 identifies the second part of the billing address.
• Record keyword. A keyword is the first text in the row. Each row that begins 
with CUST in the first cell (labeled 3 in Figure 26-10) represents a separate 
customer record.
• Record values. The other cells in a row contain the values that QuickBooks 
imports into the designated fields, as shown in the cell labeled 4 in Figure 26-10.
When you have an IIF file with the correct keywords, here’s how to import it into 
QuickBooks:
1.	 Choose File→Utilities→Import→IIF Files.
QuickBooks opens the Import dialog box with the “Files of type” box set to 
“IIF Files (*.IIF).”
2.	 Navigate to the folder where the file you want to import is saved, and then 
double-click the file’s name.
QuickBooks displays a message box telling you that it imported the data suc­
cessfully. (If you didn’t set up the keywords correctly or QuickBooks ran into 
other problems with the data in the file, it tells you that it didn’t import the 
data successfully.)

CHAPTER
27
T
he QuickBooks Home Page is laid out like the workflow you follow when 
you’re bookkeeping, so it acts like a roadmap to many of the accounting tasks 
you perform. Shortcuts to other helpful QuickBooks features are sprinkled 
throughout the program’s icon bars and Vendor, Customer, and Employee centers.
But your business isn’t like anyone else’s. For example, if you run a strictly cash-sales 
business, you might not care about customer lists and invoices; making deposits, 
though, is a daily event. Fortunately, you don’t have to accept QuickBooks’ initial 
take on convenience. The Home Page and the icon bars come stocked with a set of 
popular shortcuts, but you can add, remove, rearrange, and otherwise edit which 
features appear on them. The box on page 697 describes several ways to custom­
ize the QuickBooks desktop. You can also add your favorite features, windows, and 
reports to the Favorites menu. This chapter covers all your options.
In addition to tweaking QuickBooks’ layout, you can also customize the program’s 
forms. QuickBooks helps you get up and running with built-in business form tem­
plates. They’ll do if you have to blast out some invoices. But when you finally find a 
few spare minutes, you can create templates that show the information you want, 
formatted the way you want, and laid out to work with your letterhead. You can even 
create multiple versions of a form. For example, you can make one invoice template 
to print on your letterhead and another for creating electronic invoices to email that 
includes your logo, company name, and address. This chapter describes the most 
efficient ways to create forms: using QuickBooks’ form designs or built-in templates 
as a basis for your own. In Appendix G (which is available from this book’s Missing 
CD page at www.missingmanuals.com/cds), you can learn how to fine-tune forms 
with advanced customization techniques and even create templates from scratch.

CUSTOMIZING 
THE HOME 
PAGE
Customizing the Home Page
The icons that QuickBooks initially displays on the Home Page are the result of the 
answers you gave during QuickBooks Setup: The program sets your companywide 
Desktop View preferences (page 643) based on your answers to things such as 
whether you track inventory, charge sales tax, or track time. But you can alter these 
settings if your business needs change. For example, if you want to start sending 
statements to customers, turn on the statement preference (see the Note on page 
296), and the icons for statement-related tasks appear on the Home Page. And if 
you just hired your first employee and turn on payroll or time-tracking preferences, 
the Employees panel appears with payroll and time-tracking icons in it. This section 
describes how you change the icons that appear on your Home Page.
UP TO SPEED
Customizing the Desktop
Each person who uses QuickBooks can make the program’s 
desktop look the way she wants by choosing Edit→ 
Preferences→Desktop View and clicking the My Preferences 
tab. Page 643 gives the full scoop on how you set preferences 
to customize the desktop, but here are the different ways you 
can make the desktop your own:
• One window or several. You can focus on one window 
at a time with the One Window option. The Multiple 
Windows option lets you see—you guessed it—several 
windows at once.
• Show Home page when opening a company file. This 
setting makes QuickBooks display the Home Page when 
you open a company file. 
• Identify different company files by color. If you work on 
several different company files, you can easily tell them 
apart by assigning a different color scheme to each 
one. When you assign a color scheme to a company file, 
QuickBooks changes the color of the main title bar and 
the title bars of every window you open while working 
on that file.
• Change the top icon bar’s color scheme. If you use the 
top icon bar, you can choose between blue-and-gray 
icons on a dark-blue background or colored icons on a 
light-gray background.
Turning Customer and Vendor Icons On and Off
The Desktop View preference category controls some of the icons that appear in 
the Home Page’s Vendors and Customers panels. To turn these icons on and off, 
choose Edit→Preferences→Desktop View, and then click the Company Preferences 
tab. (Because these settings apply to your whole company, they’re on the Company 
Preferences tab, which means you have to be a QuickBooks admin to adjust them.) 
Then, in the Customers and Vendors sections, turn on a checkbox to display the 
corresponding icon, or turn it off to hide it. For example, if you want to create Sales 
Receipts, turn on the Sales Receipts checkbox, and the Create Sales Receipts icon 
appears in the Customers panel, as shown in Figure 27-1.

Chapter 27: Customizing QuickBooks

CUSTOMIZING 
THE HOME 
PAGE
FIGURE 27-1
In the Desktop View 
preference category, the 
settings on the Company 
Preferences tab let you 
customize your Home 
Page. Display or hide icons 
on the Home Page by 
turning their checkboxes 
on or off here. 
For example, if you want 
to create sales receipts, 
turn on the Sales Receipts 
checkbox. When you do 
that, QuickBooks displays 
the Create Sales Receipts 
icon on your Home Page.
The Invoices checkbox and the “Enter Bills and Pay Bills” checkbox have an additional 
trick up their sleeves. In some cases, they’re active (meaning you can turn them 
on or off), just like the Sales Receipts checkbox in Figure 27-1. However, if they’re 
dimmed (so you can’t click them to toggle them on and off) and have an asterisk 
next to them, as shown in Figure 27-1, QuickBooks has turned them on automatically 
because of other preference selections you’ve made. For example, the “Enter Bills 
and Pay Bills” checkbox is turned on automatically if you turn on inventory. That 
makes sense if you think about it, because you have to enter bills to pay for inventory 
you purchase. (Click the “How do I remove this feature icon from the Home page?” 
link to read a Help topic that lists the settings you need to change.) The Invoices 
checkbox is turned on automatically in several situations:
• Estimates are turned on. QuickBooks turns on invoices when estimates are 
turned on because you can convert estimates into invoices (page 282).

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
698
CUSTOMIZING 
THE HOME 
PAGE
• Sales orders (available only in QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise) are 
turned on. Because sales orders eventually lead to invoices, QuickBooks turns 
on the Invoices preference if you turn on this preference (page 663).
• Both sales receipts and statements are turned off. When these preferences 
are both turned off, QuickBooks turns on the Invoices preference, because 
invoices are the only other type of sales form available.
• Sales receipts are turned off, but sales tax is turned on. This combination of 
settings makes QuickBooks turn on the Invoices preference because invoices 
are the only other sales form besides sales receipts that handle sales tax.
Turning Related Preferences On and Off
Some Home Page icons appear or disappear when you turn their corre­
sponding preferences on or off. In the Desktop View preference category 
(Edit→Preferences→Desktop View), the Company Preferences tab’s Related Prefer­
ences section (visible in Figure 27-2) offers shortcuts to those preferences. (These 
links take you to the Company Preferences tabs in other preference categories, so 
you need admin privileges to change the settings described in this section.) Here’s 
how you use the links in that section to turn these icons on or off:
• Click the Estimates link and QuickBooks displays the Jobs & Estimates cat­
egory’s Company Preferences tab. If you select the Yes radio button in the “Do 
You Create Estimates?” section, QuickBooks displays the Estimates icon in the 
Home Page’s Customers panel. If you select the No radio button instead, the 
Estimates icon disappears from the Home Page.
• Click the Sales Tax link to jump to the Sales Tax category’s Company Preferences 
tab. Select the Yes option next to the “Do you charge sales tax?” label to display 
the Manage Sales Tax icon in the Home Page’s Vendors panel. If you select the 
No option instead, the Manage Sales Tax icon disappears from the Home Page.
• Clicking the Inventory link takes you to the Items & Inventory category’s Com­
pany Preferences tab. If you need to track inventory, turn on the “Inventory 
and purchase orders are active” checkbox. When you do, the Purchase Orders, 
Receive Inventory, and Enter Bills Against Inventory icons appear on the Home 
Page. If you turn this checkbox off, these icons disappear.
• Click the Payroll link to display the Payroll & Employees category’s Company 
Preferences tab. If you choose a payroll option in the QuickBooks Payroll Fea­
tures section, such as Full Payroll, the Pay Employees and Pay Liabilities icons 
appear in the Employees panel of the Home Page. If you select No Payroll 
instead, those icons disappear.
• Click the Time Tracking link to jump to the Time & Expenses category’s Company 
Preferences tab. If you click the Yes option next to the “Do you track time?” 
label, the program displays the Enter Time icon in the Home Page’s Employees 
panel. If you select the No option instead, the Enter Time icon disappears from 
the Home Page.

you see “(off)” instead, 
then the preference is

 TIP 	 If you turn off both payroll and time tracking, the Employees panel disappears from the Home Page.
Account Balances
If you use the top icon bar, then at the Home Page’s top right you’ll see the Account 
Balances section, which displays your bank accounts and their balances. You can 
sort the account list by account name or balance.
If you use the left icon bar, the Account Balances section doesn’t appear on the Home 
Page. Instead, you have to click View Balances in the left icon bar’s middle section 
to display account balances in the icon bar’s top section. When you display account 
balances in the left icon bar, you can choose the accounts you want to see in the list 
and the order in which they appear. To do that, click the “Customize view balances” 
link at the bottom of the View Balances section. The Customize Account Balances 
dialog box opens. To add an account to the list, select it in the Available Accounts 
list, and then click Add. To remove an account, select it in the Selected Accounts list,

FEATURES
Fast Access to Favorite Features
In addition to the Home Page, QuickBooks gives you two other ways to access 
your favorite features fast: the Favorites menu and the icon bar. Out of the box, 
the Favorites menu is nearly empty, waiting for you to add your preferred features 
and reports. On the other hand, icons for QuickBooks’ centers and other popular 
features fill up the icon bar from the get-go, but depending on how you like to work, 
those icons may languish unclicked. This section describes how to add entries to 
the Favorites menu and modify the icon bar to display only the features you want.
Building Your Favorites Menu
The Favorites menu, which is located to the right of the Lists menu on the main 
QuickBooks menu bar, initially has only one entry: Customize Favorites. Choosing 
this option opens the Customize Your Menus dialog box, where you can add almost 
any feature or report to the Favorites menu. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Favorites→Customize Favorites.
The Customize Your Menus dialog box opens. The Available Menu Items list 
is a directory of every feature QuickBooks has to offer—every entry on every 
menu and submenu on the program’s menu bar appears in this list. The top-
level menu bar entries are aligned with the left side of the list box, menu entries 
are indented, and submenu entries are indented even more. Even the Reports 
section leaves nothing out—you can choose any built-in, custom, or memorized 
report in your company file.
2.	 In the Available Menu Items list, select a feature you want to add to the 
Favorites menu, and then click Add.
The feature appears in the Chosen Menu Items list, as shown in Figure 27-3.
3.	 To rearrange the entries, select one and then click Move Up or Move Down 
until it’s in the position you want.
You can’t indent entries or add any kind of separator to help you find the ones 
you want.
4.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
Now when you click the Favorites menu, it displays all the features you added to it.
Customizing the Icon Bar
The QuickBooks icon bar initially includes icons that open some of the program’s 
popular features, like the Home Page, the Report Center, and others, depending 
on which edition of the program you use. If the Home Page always seems to be 
hidden behind several open windows, you can use the icon bar instead to access 
your favorite features, memorized reports, or windows you open often. (When you 
display the icon bar by choosing either View→Left Icon Bar or View→Top Icon Bar, 
it remains on top of any open windows in the main QuickBooks window—including 
the Home Page.) You can customize the icon bar to include just the entries you want

and change its appearance in several ways. (Any customizations you make apply to 
both the top and left icon bars.)
FIGURE 27-3
To remove an entry from the 
Favorites menu, select it in the 
Chosen Menu Items list, and 
then click Remove.
To change the order of the en-
tries, select the entry you want 
to move, and then click Move Up 
or Move Down until the entry is 
where you want it.
 NOTE 	 The left icon bar makes features easy to find because you can see both their icons and their full text 
labels. It also offers several other handy features; for the full story, see page 30. If the left icon bar takes up too 
much screen real estate, click the left arrow at the icon bar’s top right to collapse it. To expand it, click the right 
arrow at the top of the collapsed icon bar.
Here are the basic steps for customizing the icon bar:
1.	 Choose View→Customize Icon Bar.
If you use the left icon bar and the My Shortcuts section is displayed at the top 
of it, you can also click the Customize Shortcuts link at the bottom of the My 
Shortcuts list (you may have to scroll down to see this link). If the top icon bar 
is visible, you can right-click it and choose Customize Icon Bar.
Whatever route you use, QuickBooks opens the Customize Icon Bar dialog box.
 NOTE 	 The icon bar has to be visible before you can customize it. If you open the View menu when the icon 
bar is hidden, the Customize Icon Bar entry is dimmed. Simply choose View→Top Icon Bar or View→Left Icon 
Bar to turn the bar back on, and then choose View→Customize Icon Bar.
2.	 In the Customize Icon Bar dialog box (Figure 27-4), add shortcuts to the 
icon bar, remove icons for features you don’t want, and edit or change the 
order in which they appear, as described in the following sections.

If you know which icons you want and don’t want, you can make those changes in 
one marathon session. Simply open the Customize Icon Bar dialog box by choosing 
View→Customize Icon Bar, and then do the following:
1.	 In the Customize Icon Bar dialog box, select the entry that you want to be 
above or to the left of the new icon you’re about to insert (depending on 
whether you use the left icon bar or the top icon bar).

If you use the left icon bar, the icons appear in the same order as in the dialog 
box’s Icon Bar Content list. The top icon bar, on the other hand, displays the top 
item in the list on its far left, and the other items to the right of that. 
When you select an entry in the list and add an icon, QuickBooks inserts the 
new icon below the selected entry in the Icon Bar Content list, so it appears 
below the selected icon on the left icon bar or to the right of the selected icon 
on the top icon bar.
2.	 Click Add.
The Add Icon Bar Item dialog box shown in Figure 27-5 opens.
3.	 In the list on the Add Icon Bar Item dialog box’s left, click the window or 
feature you want to add, like Create Invoices (which opens the Create In­
voices window).
QuickBooks automatically selects an icon in the list of graphics and fills in the 
Label and Description boxes. If you like, click a different graphic and/or edit 
the text in these boxes to change the label that appears on the icon bar or the 
description that appears as a tooltip when you put your cursor over the icon.

ent icon in the list of graphics 
or type the new text in the

Keep the Label text brief so 
the label isn’t truncated in

ADDING WINDOWS OR REPORTS TO THE ICON BAR
The Add Icon Bar Item dialog box doesn’t list every QuickBooks window, but that 
doesn’t prevent you from adding windows to the icon bar. Once you realize that 
you open the same window again and again, you can add an icon for it to the icon 
bar without even opening the Customize Icon Bar dialog box. For example, you can 
add an icon for a memorized report that you’ve created (an Accounts Receivable 
Aging Detail report, say) because reports open in their own windows. Here’s how:
1.	 Open the window for the feature or report you want to add to the icon bar, 
and then choose View→“Add ‘[window name]’ to Icon Bar,” where [window 
name] is the name of the window you just opened, as in “Add ‘A/R Aging 
Detail’ to Icon Bar.”
The Add Window to Icon Bar dialog box opens.
 NOTE 	 If the wrong window name appears in the View menu’s Add entry, be sure to activate the window 
you want before choosing the entry in the View menu.
2.	 In the Add Window to Icon Bar dialog box, click the icon you want to use 
and, in the Label and Description boxes, type the text you want for the 
icon’s label and tooltip.
In the left icon bar, the label appears in the My Shortcuts list. In the top icon 
bar, the label appears below the icon if you display labels as described in the 
Tip on page 705. In either icon bar, the text in the Description box appears as 
a tooltip when you put your cursor over the icon. Keep the label short and use 
the description to elaborate on the window or report’s contents.

3.	 Click OK to add the window or report to the icon bar.
QuickBooks plunks the window or report’s icon at the right end of the top icon 
bar or, if you’re using the left icon bar, at the bottom of the My Shortcuts sec­
tion. If you want the icon somewhere else, choose View→Customize Icon Bar, 
and then reposition it in the list (page 701).
CHANGING AN ICON’S APPEARANCE
To change an icon or its associated text, in the Customize Icon Bar dialog box, click 
the icon’s entry and then click Edit. QuickBooks opens the Edit Icon Bar Item dialog 
box, which lets you change three features of each icon:
• Icon. In the icon list, select the graphic you want to appear on the icon bar. 
You can’t design your own icons, and QuickBooks doesn’t care whether you 
choose an icon that fits the feature you’re adding. For instance, an icon with a 
checkbook register and pen might be good for Writing Checks, but you could 
choose the faucet with a drop of water if you prefer.
• Label. If you want to shorten the icon’s label to condense the top icon bar (or 
to prevent the label from being truncated in the left icon bar), in the Label box, 
type the new text.
• Description. To change the text that appears as a tooltip for the icon, in the 
Description box, type your own.
 TIP 	 In the top icon bar, you can squeeze icons together and reduce the icon bar’s height by removing icon 
labels. Simply open the Customize Icon Bar dialog box and select the “Show icons only” option. Without labels 
to tell you what the icons represent, you can see a hint by putting your cursor over the icon to display its tooltip 
description. If you change your mind and want to display labels again, select the “Show icons and text” option.
CHANGING THE ORDER OF ICONS
If you want to group related icons, you can change the order of the items in the icon 
bar as explained in Figure 27-6. Figure 27-6 also shows you how to add separators 
to make the groups stand out in the top icon bar. (The left icon bar doesn’t display 
separators, so you can add them only when the top icon bar is displayed.) To make 
these changes, open the Customize Icon Bar dialog box.
Customizing the Company Snapshot
The Company Snapshot (page 43) displays key statistics about your business in 
one convenient window. You can choose from almost two dozen different views of 
financial status, like income and expense trends, account balances, customers who 
owe money, invoice payment status, receivables reports, and so on.

icons in the top icon bar, select 
the last icon in the group, and 
then click Add Separator. In

To change the views that appear in the Company Snapshot window, first open the 
window by choosing Company→Company Snapshot. Next, click the tab you want 
to customize (Company, Payments, or Customer), and then click Add Content near 
the top-left corner of the window. The “Add content to your [tab name] Snapshot” 
panel appears with the name and a thumbnail of each view you can choose, as shown 
in Figure 27-7. (You may need to resize or maximize the window to see everything 
shown in Figure 27-7.)
Here’s how you customize the Company Snapshot:
• Add a view. In the Add Content panel, click the Add button to the right of the 
view you want, and QuickBooks adds it to the body of the Company Snapshot. 
After you add a view, its button’s label changes to a green checkmark and the 
word “Added.”
• Remove a view. In the lower part of the window, click the Close button (the X) 
at a view’s top-right corner, and then click OK in the message box that appears. 
(If you change your mind about deleting the view, instead of clicking OK, click 
the X in the message box’s top right instead.)
• Reposition a view. In the lower part of the window, put your cursor over the 
view’s title and, when the cursor changes to a four-headed arrow, drag the view 
to its new location in the Company Snapshot window.
When the Company Snapshot shows what you want, click the down arrow to the 
right of the Add Content label to close the “Add content to your [tab name] Snap­

Customizing Forms
Everything you do says something about your business—even the forms you use. 
If you run a small company and don’t have a spare second to customize forms, the 
built-in QuickBooks invoices and other form templates work just fine. But if you want 
business forms that convey your sense of style and attention to detail, customized 
form templates are the way to go. A form template controls the appearance of a 
specific type of form, such as a purchase order, invoice, or credit memo; you can 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

CUSTOMIZING 
FORMS
specify what fields appear on the form, how the fields are formatted, and how they’re 
laid out. (The box below describes another way to spiff up your QuickBooks forms.)
In QuickBooks, the customization you can apply to form templates comes in several 
shapes and sizes, described in detail in the sections that follow:
• Basic customization. You can add a logo to forms or turn company information 
fields on or off, depending on what your letterhead includes. Aesthetics like the 
color scheme and fonts are also at your command.
• Changing fields. To notch up the customization, you can choose the fields that 
appear in forms’ headers, footers, and columns. You can also specify some print­
ing options, whether to print trailing zeroes, and (if you display trailing zeroes) 
the minimum number of decimal places. To learn all these tricks, see page 714.
• Designing form layout. The ultimate in form customization, QuickBooks’ Layout 
Designer gives you full control over form design. You can add fields and images, 
plunk them where you want, and format them as you please. For example, you 
can resize and reposition fields to emphasize the balance due. To learn how to 
fine-tune forms and build them from scratch, see Appendix G on this book’s

helps you create a form design that specifies the appearance—
including the background (like a watermark), logo, colors, 
fonts, and the format of the grid that holds your data—of any 
form. Because a form design applies to any form, it specifies 
only form formatting, not the fields contained in a form or 
where fields are located. (Don’t expect miracles from form 
designs. The formatting you can choose is limited.)
Using this online tool is a step-by-step process that’s easy to 
follow, and when you’re done, you can save the design and 
apply it to all the forms in your QuickBooks company file in 
one fell swoop. From then on, you choose the forms you want 
to use as you would normally (page 230).
You can open a browser window to the QuickBooks Forms 
Customization tool from the Templates window. To do that, 
choose Lists→Templates. There, click Templates→Create 
Form Design. Alternatively, in a transaction window such as 
Create Invoices, click the window’s Formatting tab, and then 
click Customize Design→Customize Design. Either way, the 
QuickBooks Forms Customization screen opens in a browser 
window. To apply a form design you’ve already created, on 
a transaction window’s Formatting tab, choose Customize 
Design→Apply Saved Design instead; then, in the browser 
window that opens, log into your online Intuit account.
Although you can use the designs you create as long as you like, 
once you apply a design to a company file, you have only 30 
days to edit your design, create new ones, and apply them to 
your forms. After that, you’ll pay $4.99 to apply a new design 
to your forms or apply your original design to new forms. Each 
time you pay $4.99, you start a 60-day period during which 
you can edit your design and apply it to any form.

Starting with an Existing Template in QuickBooks
Whether you plan to make minor adjustments or major revisions, you don’t have 
to start from scratch. One way to build your own forms is to start with a template 
that comes with QuickBooks or use another customized template that you’ve put 
together. (To learn how to customize a template while you’re in the middle of a task 
like creating an invoice, see the box on page 710.)
Here’s how to edit an existing template:
1.	 Choose Lists→Templates.
QuickBooks opens the Templates window, which displays built-in templates and 
any that you’ve created. If you’re looking for a specific type of form to start with, 
the Type column displays labels such as Invoice and Credit Memo.
2.	 In the Name column, click the template you want to edit, and then press 
Ctrl+E to open the Basic Customization dialog box (shown in Figure 27-9 
on page 711).
Alternatively, click the template’s name, and then click Templates→Edit Tem­
plate.
3.	 In the Basic Customization dialog box, click Manage Templates.
The Manage Templates dialog box appears, and QuickBooks automatically 
selects the name of the template you’re editing.
 TIP 	 If you ever want to rename a template, open the Manage Templates dialog box as described above, 
choose the template in the Select Template list and then, on the dialog box’s right, type the new name in the 
Template Name box.
4.	 In the Manage Templates dialog box, below the Select Template list, click 
Copy. Then, in the Template Name box on the dialog box’s right, rename 
the copy you just created, and then click OK.
When you click Copy, QuickBooks automatically fills in the Template Name box 
on the right side of the dialog box with “Copy of: [template].” Type over this 
text to name the template something meaningful, and then click OK to return 
to the Basic Customization dialog box. By doing this, you can keep the edited 
template or go back to the original.
5.	 Back in the Basic Customization dialog box, make the changes you want.
For basic customization instructions, see the next section. To learn how to change 
the fields on a template, see page 713. And, for full layout instructions, see 
Appendix G on this book’s Missing CD page at www.missingmanuals.com/cds.
6.	 When the template looks the way you want, in the Basic Customization 
dialog box, click OK.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
Editing a Template While You Work
I’ve created a transaction (specifically, an invoice), and the form 
preview doesn’t look the way I want. Is there a way to change 
the form template without leaving the transaction window?
Happily, yes. If you’re in the midst of creating a transaction 
and realize you need to modify the form’s template, you 
can customize the template without interfering with the 
transaction-in-progress. In the transaction window (Create 
Invoices, for instance), make sure that the template you want 
to use (and modify) appears in the Template box. If it doesn’t, 
click the down arrow on the right side of the box, and then 
choose the one you want.
To customize the template, click the transaction window’s 
Formatting tab (Figure 27-8), and then click Manage Templates. 
In the Manage Templates window, click OK to open the Basic 
Customization dialog box (described below). From there, you 
can access the Additional Customization dialog box for middle-
of-the-road changes (page 713) and the Layout Designer for 
advanced customization (see online Appendix G). The Format-
ting tab’s Customize Design button opens a browser window to 
the QuickBooks Forms Customization tool, which is described in 
the box on page 708. (If you open this window inadvertently, 
simply close it, and then choose the feature you wanted on 
the Formatting tab.)
A word of warning: Working on a template and a transaction 
at the same time can overtax your brain or a computer that’s 
low on system resources. To keep things straight and running 
smoothly, consider finishing the transaction first and then 
editing the template. After the template is the way you want it, 
you can reopen the transaction window, display the transaction 
you want, and then print or email it.
FIGURE 27-8
To preview a form before 
you print it, in the transac-
tion window (like Create 
Invoices, shown here), 
click the Formatting tab, 
and then click Preview. If 
the form doesn’t look the 
way you want, repeat the 
template customization 
steps to change it. When 
you’re done, click the 
transaction window’s Main 
tab, and then click the 
Print icon.
Basic Customization
QuickBooks’ Basic Customization dialog box (Figure 27-9) lets you perform the most 
common types of form changes, while the fancier options stay hidden unless you 
ask for them. (The previous section explains how to open this dialog box and select 
a template.) The name of the template you’re customizing appears at the top-left 

Chapter 27: Customizing QuickBooks
711
CUSTOMIZING 
FORMS
corner of the dialog box, just below the Selected Template label. (It’s a good idea 
to verify that the template you’re about to edit is the one you want.) This section 
walks you through your basic options.
 NOTE 	 The Basic Customization dialog box includes a Preview pane on its right side so you can see whether 
your template changes are what you want. To preview the form for a transaction like an invoice you’re about to 
send, in the transaction’s window, click the Formatting tab (shown in Figure 27-8), and then click Preview.
ADDING A LOGO
Adding a logo to a QuickBooks template can turn plain paper into a decent-looking 
document, and it’s the only way to display your company logo on a form you send 
as a PDF file. Here’s what you do:
1.	 In the Basic Customization dialog box, turn on the “Use logo” checkbox.
The Select Image dialog box opens. QuickBooks sets the “Files of type” box 
to All Image Files, so you’ll see any kind of graphic file in the selected folder. 
(Later on, if you want to change the image you chose, in the Basic Customiza­
tion dialog box, click the Select Logo button.)
2.	 In the Select Image dialog box, navigate to the folder that contains your logo 
file, and then double-click the filename. In the message box that appears 
telling you that QuickBooks will copy your image, click OK.
In the Basic Customization dialog box, the file’s name and size appear to the right 
of the “Use logo” checkbox, as Figure 27-9 shows. In the dialog box’s Preview 
pane, QuickBooks puts your logo in the form’s top-left corner.
FIGURE 27-9
If you print some forms on 
company letterhead and 
send others via email, cre-
ate two templates for the 
form—one with your logo 
and one without. Then, 
when you create the in-
voice or other transaction, 
choose the template that 
matches the way you plan 
to send the document.
 NOTE 	 QuickBooks copies the logo file into a subfolder within the folder that holds your company file. For 
instance, if your company file is named DoubleTrouble.qbw and resides in the folder C:\QBCompanyFiles, QuickBooks 
creates the folder C:\QBCompanyFiles\DoubleTrouble - Images and places the copy of the logo file there. If you 
decide to edit your original logo file, be sure to copy the edited file into this subfolder.

3.	 If you want to reposition the logo, do so within the Layout Designer (see 
Appendix G, online).
4.	 When the logo looks good, proceed to another customization in the Basic 
Customization dialog box or click OK to close the dialog box.
 TIP 	 If a logo that you added disappears from the template, don’t panic—simply repeat the steps above to 
add the logo to the template again. If the logo still doesn’t appear, exiting and restarting QuickBooks should 
solve the problem.
APPLYING A COLOR SCHEME
If you’re eager to show off your new color printer, you can change the color of the 
lines and text on the form. In the Basic Customization dialog box’s Select Color 
Scheme drop-down menu, choose the one you want, and then click the Apply Color 
Scheme button. The Preview pane shows the Technicolor results.
CHANGING FONTS
You can change a template’s fonts to make them easier to read and/or more at­
tractive. (You can also change the font for a single object in a form, as described 
in online Appendix G.) QuickBooks divides the text on forms into categories: Title, 
Company Name, Company Address, Labels, Data, Subtotals Label, and Total Label. 
The Labels category controls the font for all the field labels on the form; the Data 
category changes the font for the values, like item description and price.
To change the font for a text category, in the Basic Customization dialog box’s 
Change Font For list, select the category, and then click the Change Font button. 
The dialog box that opens has all the usual font formatting options, just like the ones 
you see when you format a report (page 589). (If you selected a color scheme, the 
font is set to that scheme’s color and you can’t change it.) When you’re finished 
making changes, click OK. Back in the Basic Customization dialog box, check out 
the Preview pane to see the results.
INCLUDING BASIC COMPANY AND TRANSACTION INFO
In the Basic Customization dialog box’s Company & Transaction Information sec­
tion, QuickBooks automatically turns on the Company Name and Company Address 
checkboxes, which is perfect if you print on plain paper. But if you have letterhead 
with your company name and address on it, be sure to turn these checkboxes off. 
The other checkboxes let you add your company’s phone number, fax number, email 
address, and website address. These values come from the company information 
you entered; to edit them, choose Company→My Company and then, in the dialog 
box that appears, click the Edit button (its icon looks like a pencil).
 NOTE 	 If you’re a QuickBooks administrator, you can modify your company info right from the Basic Cus­
tomization dialog box. Simply click the Update Information button to open the Company Information dialog box.

CUSTOMIZING 
FORMS
Remember the status stamps that QuickBooks adds to forms, such as the word 
“PAID,” which appears as a watermark on an invoice when you’ve received the 
payment? QuickBooks turns on the Print Status Stamp checkbox initially, so those 
watermarks appear when you print forms. If you don’t want to print these status 
stamps, turn off this checkbox.
Additional Customization
At the bottom of the Basic Customization dialog box, clicking Additional Custom­
ization displays—you guessed it—the Additional Customization dialog box, which 
includes several tabs for picking the fields you want on the template and when they 
should appear. The tabs in this dialog box are the same for every type of form tem­
plate, unless you create an invoice form and have the Progress Invoicing preference 
turned on (page 655). In that case, QuickBooks adds the Prog Cols tab, as shown 
in Figure 27-10, so you can pick the columns you want to add for progress billing.
FIGURE 27-10
To include a field onscreen, 
turn on its Screen check-
box. To print a field, turn 
on its Print checkbox.
The Title boxes show the 
text that appears as the 
field labels. QuickBooks 
fills them in with either 
the field’s name or a label 
that identifies the type 
of form, such as Invoice 
for the Default Title field. 
If you like, you can edit 
these labels.
 NOTE 	 If you try to customize one of Intuit’s built-in form templates, you might see a warning that the 
template is designed for use with Intuit’s preprinted forms. In that case, in the Locked Template message box, 
click Make a Copy so you can customize a copy of the template. That way, if you decide to use Intuit preprinted 
forms, you can still select the original template.
Each tab relates to a different area of the form. Setting up the fields on the tabs is 
straightforward, but a few of them have extra features:
• Header. The fields on this tab appear at the top of the form just above the table 
area. The more common fields for the type of form you’re customizing (like 
Date, Bill To, P.O. No., and Terms for an invoice) are turned on automatically. At 
the bottom of the list, you can turn on the checkboxes for custom fields you’ve 
created to include them on your forms.

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
714
CUSTOMIZING 
FORMS
• Columns. These fields appear as columns in the form’s table area, like the item 
description, quantity, rate, and amount for each line item in an invoice. In ad­
dition to specifying whether they appear onscreen and/or when printed, you 
can specify the order of the columns by filling in the Order boxes with numbers 
starting at 1 for the first field. If a field isn’t included in the form, QuickBooks 
puts a zero in its Order box.
 NOTE 	 As mentioned on page 713, if you have progress invoicing turned on, you’ll also see the Prog Cols tab.
• Footer. The fields that appear in the form’s footer (the area below its table) 
include Message, Sales Tax, Total, and so on. For an invoice, if you want to 
include the total balance for a customer—including both the current balance 
and the previous balance—turn on the Customer Total Balance checkbox. The 
“Long text” box lets you add a substantial block of text to a form, like a legal 
disclaimer or other lengthy note. If you add this field to a form, the text in it 
appears only on the printed version, not onscreen.
• Print. You can set up printer options for different types of forms by choosing 
File→Printer Setup, selecting the form, and then choosing the settings you 
want (page 208). On this tab, QuickBooks automatically selects the “Use [form] 
printer settings from Printer Setup” option, which means it uses those printer 
settings. But if you have a special form that doesn’t use the same print settings 
as the other templates in that category, select the “Use specified printer settings 
below for this [form]” option instead, and then choose the orientation, number 
of copies, and paper size for just that form.
QuickBooks automatically turns on the “Print page numbers on forms with more 
than 2 pages” checkbox. If you bill to fractions of an hour, turn on the Print 
Trailing Zeros checkbox, which adds zeros and a decimal point so that whole 
number and decimal quantities line up.
Managing Templates
The Templates window (Lists→Templates) includes features for managing the tem­
plates you create. In that window’s bottom left, click Templates and then choose 
an option from the menu. Besides obvious tasks like New, Edit Template, and De­
lete Template, this menu includes options for other helpful things you can do with 
templates. This section describes how to manage your templates, and the box on 
page 715 describes how to download premade templates. Templates are company 
specific, so you’ll also learn how to export your custom templates from one company 
file to use in others.
 TIP 	 To preview templates before you choose one to work on, in the Templates window, select any template 
of the type you want (Invoices, Purchase Orders, and so on), and then press Ctrl+E. In the Basic Customization 
dialog box, click Manage Templates to see a list of all the templates of the same type as the one you selected 
in the Templates window. Simply click a template’s name to see a preview of it in the Manage Templates dialog 
box’s Preview pane.

POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Templates Without Tedium
Say you find QuickBooks’ built-in templates boring, but you 
don’t have the time or design know-how to put together 
templates of your own. In that case, you can download spiffy 
templates from the QuickBooks website. For example, contrac-
tors can choose invoice templates with a drill or tape measure 
in the background.
In the Templates window (Lists→Templates), click Templates 
→Download Templates. The program opens a browser window 
to the Forms section of the QuickBooks Library. You can search 
for form templates and specify the type of form.
When you find a template you like, click its Download link to 
save the template’s export file (which has a .des file extension) 
on your computer. Back in QuickBooks’ Templates window, click 
Templates→Import. In the Select File to Import dialog box that 
appears, select the file you downloaded, and then click Open.
COPYING A TEMPLATE
Copying a template before you start editing it is always a good idea, in case your 
edits go awry and you want the original back. You can create a copy of a template 
in two ways:
• In the Basic Customization dialog box (page 709), click Manage Templates. 
In the Select Template list, click the template’s name, and then click the Copy 
button below the list. QuickBooks adds the copy to the list and names it “Copy 
of: [template].” To rename the copy, on the right side of the Manage Templates 
window, type the new name in the Template Name box, and then click OK.
• In the Templates window, select the template you want to copy, and then click 
Templates→Duplicate. The Select Template Type dialog box appears, which 
lets you choose any type of template for the duplicate, regardless of what the 
original template type is. (For example, you can duplicate an invoice template but 
specify that the copy is a sales receipt instead.) When you click OK in the Select 
Template Type dialog box, QuickBooks adds the duplicate to the list with “Copy 
of:” in front of the original’s name. To rename the copy, right-click it in the list 
and choose Edit Template. In the Basic Customization dialog box, click Manage 
Templates, type the new name in the Template Name box, and then click OK.
 WARNING 	 If you copy a template to use as a basis for a new one you want to create, be sure to edit the 
copy’s name to identify what the form does, such as InvoiceNoLogo for the one you print on letterhead. If you 
copy a template as a backup in case you mangle the original, first check that the copy is what you want. (The 
words “Copy of:” that QuickBooks adds to the beginning of the template’s name tell you that it’s a backup.) After 
you’ve modified the original template and you’re completely confident that the edited template is correct, you 
can delete the copy to keep your template list tidy.

DELETING OR HIDING A TEMPLATE
You can delete only the templates you create yourself, not ones that come with Quick­
Books. To do so, click one in the Templates window, and then click Templates→Delete 
Template. If you try to delete a built-in QuickBooks template, the program tells you 
that you’re out of luck.
However, you can hide built-in templates if you don’t want them to appear in the 
Templates List. The process is just like making a customer, vendor, or invoice item 
inactive. To do so, in the Templates window, select the template, and then click 
Templates→Make Template Inactive. You can then reactivate it by first turning on 
the “Include inactive” checkbox at the bottom of the window to display all templates, 
and then clicking the X to the left of the template’s name.
EXCHANGING TEMPLATES BETWEEN COMPANY FILES
If you want to trade form templates between company files, you can export them 
from one company file and import them into another. Here’s how:
1.	 To export a form template, in the Templates window (Lists→Templates), 
select the template you want to export (you can export only one at a time), 
and then click Templates→Export.
The “Specify Filename for Export” dialog box opens.
2.	 Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file, and in the “File name” 
box, type a name for the file.
QuickBooks automatically sets the “Save as type” box to “Template Files 
(*.DES),” which is what you want.
3.	 When everything looks good, click Save.
After you’ve saved the template, simply open the other company file in QuickBooks, 
and then import the template file like so:
1.	 In the Templates window, choose Templates→Import.
The “Select File to Import” dialog box opens.
2.	 Double-click the template file you want to import, and you’re done.

CHAPTER

Y
our QuickBooks records are indispensable. They help you invoice customers 
and pay bills, and also provide the information you need to prepare your tax 
returns and plan for the future. A company file does so much, yet many com­
panies don’t take the time to keep their financial data safe and secure.
Losing data to a hard disk crash is a shock to your financial system as well as your 
computer’s. But having someone embezzle money from your accounts could send 
years of hard work down the drain. Protecting your QuickBooks data takes so little 
time that there’s no excuse for not doing it. (In addition to QuickBooks security, don’t 
forget common-sense security like locking the door to your office.)
If you’re the untrusting type or simply have no one else to do your bookkeeping, 
you can skip this chapter’s discussion of creating users and setting up user permis­
sions. The administrator login is all you need to work on your company file—and 
QuickBooks creates that automatically. But even if you don’t intentionally let other 
people access your financial data, that doesn’t mean that someone won’t try to 
access it without your permission. Good computer security measures like firewalls, 
up-to-date antivirus software, and passwords that strangers can’t guess go a long 
way toward preventing unauthorized fiddling with your finances.
When you have several people working on your company file, security is a bit trickier. 
Each person who accesses your financial data is a potential problem, whether in­
tentional or inadvertent. By setting up users in QuickBooks and specifying which 
areas of the program they can access, you can delegate work to others without 
worrying about security quite so much. With the audit trail that QuickBooks keeps 
(page 437), every transaction that’s modified or deleted is there for you to review.

QuickBooks Data Secure

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

SETTING UP THE 
ADMINISTRATOR
Setting Up the Administrator
In QuickBooks, the administrator is all powerful. Only someone who logs in with 
administrator privileges can create new users, assign permissions and passwords 
to other users, and set company preferences. This section explains how to assign 
the administrator’s user name and password, and turn on the feature for protect­
ing your customers’ credit card information (if you accept credit card payments).
 NOTE 	 Although QuickBooks doesn’t ask you to set the administrator password, you should do that right 
away. If you don’t, anyone who opens your company file is automatically logged in as the administrator, with 
full access to every feature of QuickBooks and every byte of your QuickBooks data.
Assigning the Administrator User Name and Password
When you create a company file, QuickBooks automatically creates the administrator 
user called Admin, but it doesn’t require you to assign a password to that user. But 
because passwords are so important in helping keep your data secure, you can—and 
should—edit the administrator user to assign one (and change the administrator’s 
user name, if you want).
 TIP 	 If you’re the only person who acts as the QuickBooks administrator and you want to transfer those duties 
to someone else, create a new user and give that user access to all areas of QuickBooks (page 725). That way, the 
audit trail (page 437) can differentiate changes made by you from those made by the new administrator. In fact, 
it’s a good idea to create a separate user with your name and use that login for most of the work you do, and 
reserve logging in as an administrator for tasks that only administrators can do.
You can use the following process to change the values for the administrator user 
anytime:
1.	 Open the company file using your preferred method and, if necessary, log 
in as the administrator.
If you don’t use QuickBooks Setup to create your company file, you can create, 
open, and close the company file without any sign of a login screen. But behind 
the scenes, QuickBooks automatically logs you in as the administrator without 
requiring a password.
If the administrator is the only user and has a password assigned, the Quick­
Books Login dialog box shows only the Password box. If this dialog box displays 
the User Name box, type the administrator’s user name. If that user account 
has a password assigned, type that in the Password box. Otherwise, leave the 
Password box blank.
2.	 Choose Company→Set Up Users and Passwords→Set Up Users.
If the QuickBooks Login dialog box appears, type the administrator password.

3.	 In the User List window, click Edit User.
In the User List window, QuickBooks automatically selects whomever you’re 
logged in as (which, in this case, is the administrator user). When you click Edit 
User, the “Change user password and access” dialog box (Figure 28-1) opens.
FIGURE 28-1
If you change the administra-
tor’s user name, the User List 
adds “(Admin)” after the user 
name to identify which user is 
the administrator, for example, 
“All Powerful (Admin).” 
Set up a challenge question 
and answer so you can reset 
your password if you forget it.
4.	 To change the administrator’s name, type a new name in the User Name box.
You don’t have to change the administrator’s name, and it may be less confusing 
if you leave it as Admin. However, if you do change it, the User List identifies 
the administrator by adding “(Admin)” after the user name, so that it reads 
something like “QuickBooks Overlord (Admin).”
5.	 In the Password box, type the password for the administrator user. In the 
Confirm Password box, type the password again.
See the box on page 720 for tips on creating good passwords. Don’t copy and 
paste the password from the Password box into the Confirm Password box. If 
you copy a typo from one box to the other, you won’t know what the admin­
istrator password is, and you won’t be able to open your company file without 
jumping through several hoops.
6.	 In the Challenge Question drop-down list, choose a question like “Favorite 
restaurant in college.” In the Challenge Answer box, type the answer to 
the question.
The next section explains how to reset the administrator password with the 
help of this challenge question. (The box on page 721 tells you how to reset 
your administrator password if you don’t know the password and don’t know 
the answer to the challenge question.)

7.	 Click Next.
The dialog box reminds you that the administrator has access to everything in 
QuickBooks. Click Finish to close the dialog box.
 WARNING 	 If you work on more than one QuickBooks company file, the program throws one user-related 
curve at you: It fills in the QuickBooks Login dialog box with the last user name you typed—whether or not it 
goes with the file you just opened. For example, say you open one company file using the user name Admin. 
When you open another file, the QuickBooks Login dialog box fills in the User Name field with “Admin,” even if 
the administrator name for the second file is I_Can_Do_Everything. So if QuickBooks won’t let you log in, make 
sure you’re using the correct user name and password for that company file.
WORD TO THE WISE
Password Guidelines
Because the QuickBooks administrator can do anything in a 
company file, choosing a trustworthy person for that role is 
a good first step in preventing financial misfortune. But your 
efforts are in vain unless you secure the administrator’s ac-
cess with a good password. In fact, assigning passwords to all 
QuickBooks users is an important security measure.
Ideally, a password should be almost impossible to guess but 
easy for the rightful owner to remember. It’s easy to meet the 
first criterion by using a random combination of upper- and 
lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation, but that makes 
the password hard to remember. And if people have trouble 
recalling their passwords, they’ll write them down somewhere, 
shooting holes in your security.
QuickBooks passwords are case-sensitive and can include up to 
16 characters. Here are some tips for creating passwords that 
are both secure and easy to remember:
• Make passwords at least seven characters long, and 
combine upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
punctuation. These are the same guidelines that the credit 
card industry uses as part of its standard for protecting 
customer information, as you can read on page 721.
• Don’t use family birthdays, names, phone numbers, 
addresses, and especially Social Security numbers.
• To make guessing more difficult, replace letters with 
numbers or punctuation that look similar. For example, 
replace the letter “I” with the number 1 or an exclamation 
point (!). Or replace the letter S with the number 5, or the 
letter E with the number 3.
• To make remembering easier, consider using names, 
birthdays, phone numbers, or addresses of people 
not obviously connected to you. For example, if no 
one suspects that Daniel Craig is your favorite actor, 
Dan!elCra1g would be a good password (but not anymore).
• To boost security, change your password every three to 
six months.
Resetting the Administrator Password
If you can’t remember your password and you selected a challenge question for 
the administrator user, you can answer that question to reset your password. Here’s 
how to use this life-saving feature:
1.	 In the QuickBooks Login dialog box, click the “I forgot my password” link.
The Reset QuickBooks Administrator Password dialog box opens.

Chapter 28: Keeping Your QuickBooks Data Secure

SETTING UP THE 
ADMINISTRATOR
2.	 In the Reset QuickBooks Administrator Password dialog box, type the an­
swer to the challenge question that appears, and then click OK.
A Password Removed message box tells you that your password, challenge 
question, and answer have been removed, which means your company file is 
no longer password-protected.
3.	 Click Close.
QuickBooks nudges you to add a password by immediately opening the Change 
QuickBooks Password dialog box.
4.	 Fill in the boxes as you would to edit the user (page 719), and then click OK.
A QuickBooks Information box tells you that your password has been changed.
5.	 Click OK.
From now on, when you correctly fill in the boxes in the QuickBooks Login dialog 
box, the program opens your company file.
TROUBLESHOOTING MOMENT
What’s the Administrator Password?
The time may come when QuickBooks asks you for a password 
you don’t know. For instance, maybe the person with the ad-
ministrator password left in a hurry, and you need it to open the 
company file. Or perhaps you’re trying to open a QuickBooks 
file from a few years ago and the passwords you’ve tried don’t 
work. If the challenge question doesn’t help, try these solutions 
before you resort to Intuit’s password-reset tool:
• Check the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys. They may not be 
set the way they were when you created your password, 
so try turning them on or off.
• Test your keyboard. Create a text document and then 
press each key to make sure it types the correct character.
If the password is still a mystery, you can reset it. In the Quick-
Books Login dialog box, click the “I forgot my password” link. 
In the Reset QuickBooks Administrator Password dialog box, 
click the “I forgot my answer” link. When you do, the dialog 
box changes to include boxes for the information you used to 
register QuickBooks: your license number, name, email ad-
dress, phone number, and Zip code. Fill in that info so Intuit 
can find your registration, and then click OK.
Intuit then verifies your info and sends you an email with a 
password-reset code. Paste that code into the Password Reset 
Code field in the Reset QuickBooks Administrator Password 
dialog box, and then click Next. When you do, the dialog box 
switches back to its original configuration so you can enter a 
new password, challenge question, and answer, as described 
on page 719.
Complying with Credit Card Security Regulations
If your company accepts credit cards, you probably already know that you have 
to comply with standards for protecting your customers’ credit card information 
(known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). If you don’t do so, 
not only is your customers’ financial information at risk, but you also risk paying 
fines for your oversight.

CREATING 
QUICKBOOKS 
USERS
Part of the standard requires that all users change their passwords every 90 days 
and use complex passwords (ones that are longer than seven characters and have a 
combination of numbers and upper- and lowercase letters). Fortunately, the steps you 
have to take in QuickBooks to comply with these requirements are simple, although 
you have to be a QuickBooks administrator to perform them:
1.	 Choose Company→Customer Credit Card Protection.
The Customer Credit Card Protection dialog box opens and explains a little bit 
about the feature.
2.	 Click Enable Protection.
The Sensitive Data Protection Setup dialog box opens. The fields are the same 
ones in the “Change user password and access” dialog box (page 719). The only 
difference is that the New Password and Confirm New Password boxes won’t 
accept passwords that don’t meet the secure-password criteria.
3.	 In the Current Password box, type the current administrator password 
(which may not meet the criteria). Then fill in the New Password and Confirm 
New Password boxes with a complex password.
QuickBooks won’t accept the password unless it’s longer than seven charac­
ters and has at least one number and one uppercase letter, like “Kath3rine,” 
for example.
4.	 In the Challenge Question drop-down list, choose a question that you can 
answer in case you need to reset the password, like “Best friend’s last or 
first name.” Then type the answer in the Answer box.
Answers to QuickBooks’ challenge questions aren’t case-sensitive.
5.	 Click OK.
After 90 days pass, QuickBooks asks you to set a new password.
 NOTE 	 After you enable credit card protection, every user that you’ve created in QuickBooks has to use a 
complex password and reset it every 90 days.
Creating QuickBooks Users
Setting up users in QuickBooks has the same advantages as setting up users in the 
Windows operating system or on your network: You can restrict people’s access to 
just the data they need to see and keep track of what they’re doing. Setting up user 
logins for the people who work on your company file helps you do several things:
• Keep sensitive data confidential. User names, passwords, and permissions 
(page 726) help protect both your and your customers’ sensitive data from 
prying eyes.

Chapter 28: Keeping Your QuickBooks Data Secure
723
CREATING 
QUICKBOOKS 
USERS
• Prevent financial hanky-panky. By limiting each employee’s access to job-
relevant data and checking the audit trail for changes or deletions (page 437), 
you can prevent embezzlement—or catch the culprit early. These measures also 
help protect your data from unintentional errors by new or careless employees.
• Let several people work in QuickBooks at the same time. QuickBooks has no 
way of knowing whether several people share the same user name. If you want 
to protect your data and identify who’s doing what in your financial records, 
each person who accesses your company file needs a unique user name and 
password. If more than one person works on your company file simultaneously, 
you have to switch it to multi-user mode, as the box below explains.
UP TO SPEED
Sharing Your Company File
Setting up multiple users for a company file doesn’t mean more 
than one person can work on the file at the same time. If you 
want several people to work on your company file simultane-
ously, you have to buy a license for QuickBooks Pro, Premier, 
or Enterprise for each computer on which you want to run 
QuickBooks and switch the company file to multi-user mode.
Multi-user mode means that you access the data in your 
company files through a database server. Here’s how it works: 
When someone performs a task in QuickBooks, his copy of the 
program asks the database server to send information or make 
changes. The database server makes the changes, retrieves 
information, and sends it back to him—and also makes sure 
that the changes don’t conflict with changes someone else 
wants to make. (Don’t worry—you won’t be quizzed about this. 
You can concentrate on your business and let QuickBooks take 
care of the file sharing.) See page 489 to learn how to switch 
between multi- and single-user mode.
Adding New Users
Only the QuickBooks administrator can create additional users. After you log in as 
the administrator, here’s how you create other users:
1.	 Choose Company→Set Up Users and Passwords→Set Up Users.
If you’ve set up an administrator password, the QuickBooks Login dialog box 
opens, asking you for your password. This extra request for the administrator 
password prevents someone from walking up to your computer while you’re 
away and creating an account for herself. After you enter your password, the 
program opens the User List dialog box shown in Figure 28-2.
2.	 Click Add User.
QuickBooks opens the “Set up user password and access” dialog box.
3.	 In the User Name box, type a user name for the person to use to access the 
company file. And in the Password box, type a password for the person.
In the Confirm Password box, retype the password.

The text “(logged on)” after a user name indicates who you’re 
logged in as. 
If the administrator’s user name is something other than Admin, 
the User List displays “(Admin)” after the name of the user who 
has administrator privileges.
4.	 To allocate one of your licenses for QuickBooks to the user you’re creating, 
turn on the “Add this user to my QuickBooks license” checkbox.
With this setting turned on, this user can open your company file at the same 
time as other users (as long as you have licenses for all of them). If people work 
on the company file one at a time, leave this checkbox turned off.
5.	 Click Next to begin setting permissions.
In the list that appears, QuickBooks automatically selects the “Selected areas 
of QuickBooks” option, which lets you control exactly what the user can do in 
various parts of the program. See page 726 for details.
Selecting the “All areas of QuickBooks” option instead gives this user access 
to all your financial data, as shown in Figure 28-3. That’s why QuickBooks asks 
you to confirm that you want the person to have such broad access.
 NOTE 	 The external accountant user has access to all parts of your company file except sensitive customer 
information—perfect if you want to set up a QuickBooks user for your accountant or bookkeeper. To learn how to 
set up an external accountant user, see page 467.
Resetting a User Password
Users can change their own passwords, which makes your company data even more 
secure, since that way only users know their own passwords. That means users can’t 
log in as someone else and perform transactions they shouldn’t (like writing checks 
to themselves). To change their passwords, users simply choose Company→Set 
Up Users and Passwords→Change Your Password. They have to type their current 
password and then type the new one.

Finish, and her user name 
appears in the User List

The administrator can also change anyone’s password. If you’re logged in as the 
administrator, choose Company→Set Up Users and Passwords→Set Up Users. In 
the User List dialog box, select the user whose password you want to change, and 
then click Edit User. In the “Change user password and access” dialog box, fill in 
the Password and Confirm Password boxes with the new password, and then click 
Next. On the “Access for user:” screen, click Next. When the next screen appears, 
the Finish button becomes active. Click it to save the user with the new password.
 NOTE 	 If someone leaves your company, be sure to delete his QuickBooks user account so no one else can 
use it. Choose Company→Set Up Users and Passwords→Set Up Users. In the User List dialog box, select the user 
you want to delete, and then click Delete User. In the confirmation message box, click Yes, and that user account 
is history.
Restricting Access to Features and Data
When several people work on your company file, it’s safer to limit what each person 
can do. For example, Trusty Ted has earned his nickname, so you could give him 
access to every QuickBooks feature, including sensitive financial reports and ac­
counting activities. And Myra Meddler can’t keep a secret, but there’s no one faster 
at data entry, so you want to make sure that she gets no further than doing the

checking, credit cards, and bill paying. The box on page 728 offers additional tips 
for keeping your data safe.
If a person chooses a feature and doesn’t have permission for that feature, Quick­
Books displays a message that identifies the permission needed to perform that 
action. In case the lack of permission was a mistake or an oversight, the message 
also suggests asking the QuickBooks administrator to grant that permission.
What the Access Areas Represent
When you tell QuickBooks that a user should have access only to selected areas 
of the program (step 5 on page 724), you have to tell QuickBooks which areas the 
person can use. For each area, you can give the user either full access or selective 
access, as explained in the next section. As you click Next, the “Set up user password 
and access” dialog box steps through one area at a time, as shown in Figure 28-4. 
There’s some overlap, because each area actually covers a lot of ground:
• Sales and Accounts Receivable. This area includes creating sales transactions 
with any kind of sales form (invoices, sales receipts, statements, and so on) 
and with any additional features (receiving payments, reimbursable expenses, 
finance charges, and so on). With sales and Accounts Receivable permissions, 
you can open the Customer Center and modify sales-related lists (such as the 
Customer:Job, Customer Type, and Ship Via lists), and customize sales forms. 
Full access includes printing and creating sales-related reports.
FIGURE 28-4
In the upper-right corner 
of the “Set up user pass-
word and access” dialog 
box, QuickBooks shows 
which page you’re on (1

Each area of QuickBooks 
appears on its own page.
When you’re done, the 
10th page shows a sum-
mary of the features that 
this user can access.
The “View complete customer credit card numbers” checkbox (visible in Figure 
28-4) helps protect your customers’ financial data. QuickBooks automatically 
turns this setting off to restrict who can see a customer’s full credit card

information. If you don’t accept plastic, leave this setting as it is. Otherwise, 
turn the checkbox on for only the people you trust to work with customer credit 
card numbers.
• Purchases and Accounts Payable. These permissions include all aspects of 
dealing with bills and vendors: entering and paying bills, working with purchase 
orders, entering reimbursable expenses and credit card charges, and paying 
sales tax. You can grant people permission to open the Vendor Center and 
modify purchase lists—such as the Vendor and Vendor Type Lists—and to cus­
tomize purchase forms. Full access includes printing 1099s and reports about 
vendors or purchases.
• Checking and Credit Cards. Permissions in this area let people write expense 
checks and refund checks (but not payroll checks), enter credit card charges, 
and make deposits.
• Inventory. If you’ve turned on QuickBooks’ inventory features, this screen ap­
pears so you can give people permissions to maintain the inventory items on 
the Item List, receive products into inventory, adjust inventory quantities, work 
with purchase orders, and generate inventory reports.
• Time Tracking. These permissions include the ability to enter time transactions 
in the weekly and single-activity timesheets, import and export Timer data, and 
generate time reports.
• Payroll and Employees. Payroll permissions include opening the Employee 
Center and the Payroll Center, writing and printing paychecks, setting up and 
paying payroll liabilities, using your selected payroll service, maintaining the 
Employee and Payroll Items lists, and generating payroll forms and reports.
• Sensitive Accounting Activities. The features covered by these permissions 
don’t belong to any one area of QuickBooks. Reserve these permissions for 
people who are not only trustworthy, but who also understand how your ac­
counting system works. With these permissions, someone can maintain your 
chart of accounts, make journal entries, transfer funds, reconcile accounts, 
access accounts through online banking, work in balance sheet account reg­
isters, and create budgets. Other permissions include condensing data (which 
removes details of past transactions), using the Accountant’s Review feature, 
and generating the payroll reports.
• Sensitive Financial Reporting. These permissions let someone print every 
report in QuickBooks, regardless of any reporting restrictions from the other 
access settings you choose.
• Changing or Deleting Transactions. As an extra precaution, you can give 
people permission to create transactions in an area, but not let them change 
or delete the transactions they’ve created. For example, for trainees just learn­
ing the ropes, you might remove their permission to edit transactions so they 
need to ask someone more experienced to make changes. An additional option 
lets people change transactions prior to the closing date for your books (page

472). Ideally, give this permission only to those who really know what they’re 
doing—like your accountant.
UP TO SPEED
Commonsense Security Measures
Your QuickBooks company file isn’t the only place you keep 
sensitive information. Be sure to set up your computers so 
that your QuickBooks data and all your other proprietary info 
are secure:
• Back up regularly. Back up your company file (page 491) 
and other data, and store the backups in a safe place. 
Make sure your backups save the files you want and that 
they restore without any problems.
• Update your operating system with security updates. 
If you use Windows, on the Start menu, choose All 
Programs→Windows Update.
• Use antivirus software and keep it up to date. These 
days, you need antivirus and anti-malware programs. 
Because the rogues who write viruses, worms, Trojans, 
and spyware don’t look like they’re going to stop anytime 
soon, be sure to regularly update your antivirus and anti-
malware programs.
• Install a firewall. An Internet connection without a firewall 
is an invitation to nosy nerds and criminals alike. A firewall 
restricts access from the Internet to only the people or 
computers you specify.
• Plan for problems. Cross-train your employees so that 
more than one person knows how to do each procedure 
in your company, including working with QuickBooks. 
Store the QuickBooks administrator’s password in the 
company safe deposit box or give it to a company officer 
for safekeeping.
Setting Access Rights
When you’re setting up a new user in the “Set up user password and access” dialog 
box (page 723), choosing the “Selected areas of QuickBooks” option takes you on 
a journey of specifying access to areas of the program (listed above). As you click 
Next to set permissions for each area of the program, you can give someone no 
access at all, full access, or the right to perform some tasks in that area, as shown 
in Figure 28-4. Here’s a guide to what each level of access lets people do:
• No Access. The person can’t open any windows or dialog boxes for that area 
of QuickBooks, meaning he can’t perform any actions in that area. QuickBooks 
automatically chooses this option; to give someone any access to an area, you 
have to choose either Full Access or Selective Access instead.
• Full Access. The person can perform every task in that area of QuickBooks 
except ones reserved for the administrator user.
• Selective Access. Selective Access separates tasks into creating transactions, 
creating and printing transactions, or creating transactions and generating 
associated reports.

Chapter 28: Keeping Your QuickBooks Data Secure
729
RESTRICTING 
ACCESS TO 
FEATURES AND 
DATA
The final screen of the “Set up user password and access” dialog box—shown in 
Figure 28-3 (page 725)—summarizes the access rights you chose for that person. 
The summary screen separates access into the same categories as the Selective 
Access level: Create, Print, and Reports. In most cases, giving someone full access 
means that “Y” appears in all three columns; giving her no access usually displays 
“N” in all three columns. When a permission isn’t applicable to an area, QuickBooks 
displays “n/a”; for example, there aren’t any reports associated with the right to 
change or delete transactions.

Q
uickBooks’ installation process offers two basic options: Install the program 
from scratch or upgrade from a previous version. When you upgrade, you 
can run both the old and new versions on your computer at the same time, 
which is essential if you’re an accountant or bookkeeper who works with company 
files from several different clients. Even if you use QuickBooks to run your own busi­
ness, you might want to keep your old version around in case you decide that you 
don’t like the new version. Be sure to back up your company file before you open it 
with the new version; once you open it in the new version of QuickBooks, it won’t 
run in the earlier version (see the box on page 734).
This appendix walks you through both paths of the installation process. You’ll also 
find out how to install QuickBooks 2015 on a company network, including where on 
a network you can store your company file—and which location to choose for best 
performance. (If several people need to access your company file at the same time, 
everyone has to run the same version of QuickBooks, so set aside time to install the 
program on all those machines.) 
Before You Install
Intuit recommends a 2.4 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM for a single user of Quick­
Books Pro. Add another 1 GB of RAM for more than one concurrent user—but dou­
bling the recommended RAM (at least 2 GB, as a rule of thumb) will probably bring 
you closer to acceptable number-crunching speeds. You also need about 2.5 GB of 
free disk space and a 4x CD/DVD drive to install the program if you bought it on CD 
rather than downloading it. QuickBooks 2015 can run on Windows Vista (Service 
	 	
Installing QuickBooks

BEFORE YOU 
INSTALL
Pack 1 or later releases), Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2003 (Service 
Pack 2), Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012. QuickBooks can run 
on 32-bit and 64-bit editions of these operating systems.
 NOTE 	 Sometimes, you may have problems running QuickBooks if your computer has a Windows Home 
edition installed, particularly if you’re working in a multi-user networked environment. The easiest solution 
(although it might cost you some money) is to install the Pro version of Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 
8 on your computer.
If you’re planning to use QuickBooks’ integration features, the versions of your other 
programs matter, too. For example, writing letters and exporting reports requires 
Microsoft Word and Excel 2007 or later (either the 32-bit or 64-bit edition), and 
synchronizing contacts requires Outlook 2007 or later. (QuickBooks Contact Sync 
integrates only with the 32-bit edition of Outlook 2010.)  
If you have several QuickBooks users, plan on upgrading everyone’s copy at the 
same time. Once you’ve upgraded everyone, you can update the company file to 
the new version of the program. Then have all your users make sure they can open 
the company file with the new version of QuickBooks. (If you update the company 
file first, your colleagues won’t be able to work in it until they have the newest ver­
sion of the program.)
 TIP 	 If you have a problem installing QuickBooks, you can look for an answer at www.quickbooks.com/
installation.
POWER USERS’ CLINIC
Installing Multiple Versions of QuickBooks
If you work with clients running different versions or editions 
of QuickBooks, don’t panic: Different versions and editions of 
the program can run on the same computer mostly without 
squabbling with each other.
For example, you can run QuickBooks Pro 2013, QuickBooks Pro 
2014, and QuickBooks Premier 2015 all on the same machine. 
As long as you access each company file with only one version 
or edition of the program, you’ll be fine. However, there are 
two situations in which QuickBooks updates company files, 
which means you won’t be able to use the files in the previous 
version or edition:
• Opening a company file in a new version updates the file 
to work with the new version and prevents earlier versions 
from opening it. So once you open your company file with 
QuickBooks 2015, your accountant won’t be able to access 
your data if she’s still running QuickBooks 2014.
• Opening a company file in QuickBooks Enterprise edition 
optimizes the file for faster performance. Once you open 
a company file in this edition, the file is off limits to 
QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Premier.

INSTALLING 
QUICKBOOKS
Installing QuickBooks
If you have a single-user license for QuickBooks, installing or upgrading the program 
on a computer running Windows 7 or Windows 8 is pretty simple. Even on a network 
with a multi-user license, installing QuickBooks is mostly common sense. (If you’re 
installing it on a computer running Windows Vista, search the Intuit QuickBooks 
Support web page [page 752] for instructions.) This section describes the steps 
that work whether you’re installing QuickBooks for the first time, installing a new 
version of the program on a computer that already has one or more older versions 
on it, or upgrading an existing version to QuickBooks 2015.
Installing QuickBooks for the First Time
If you don’t have any other version of QuickBooks installed on your computer, in­
stalling QuickBooks 2015 is straightforward. Here’s what you do:
1.	 Log into Windows as a user with administrator rights.
Windows Server, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 require adminis­
trator rights to install QuickBooks. If you have trouble installing, try disabling 
your firewall, too. And shut down any running programs, including your virus-
protection program (a good idea when you’re installing any software).
2.	 If you downloaded QuickBooks, double-click the file you downloaded. If 
you have a QuickBooks DVD, put the disc in your DVD drive.
You’ll see the Intuit QuickBooks Installer screen and a “Welcome to Quick­
Books!” greeting.
3.	 When the Next button becomes active, click it.
The License Agreement screen appears.
4.	 After you read the software agreement carefully, turn on the “I accept the 
terms of the license agreement” checkbox, and then click Next.
You should always read software license agreements so you know the legal 
terms you’re accepting.
5.	 On the “Choose your installation type” screen, select either “Express 
(recommended)” or “Custom and Network options,” and then click Next.
Because you’re installing QuickBooks for the first time, the Express option sets 
up QuickBooks for single-user access (page 489) and installs the program in 
C:\Program Files\Intuit\QuickBooks 2015 on 32-bit computers (C:\Program 
Files(x86)\Intuit\QuickBooks 2015 on 64-bit computers). If you choose this 
option, the installation jumps to a screen that asks for the license and product 
numbers; hop to step 7 of this list for details. (You can change the program’s 
preferences to allow multiple users after QuickBooks is up and running; see 
page 489.)

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
736
INSTALLING 
QUICKBOOKS
The “Custom and Network options” setting lets you choose where to install 
QuickBooks on your computer, install the program and share a company file 
with others, or set up the computer only to share the company file (page 741). 
If you choose this option, continue with step 6 of this list.
6.	 If you selected the “Custom and Network options” setting, choose a setting 
on the “Custom and Network Options” screen, and then click Next.
If you’re the only person who uses QuickBooks, select “I’ll be using QuickBooks 
on this computer.” This option installs the program on your computer and sets it 
up for single-user access to your company file. (You can change this preference 
to allow multiple users once QuickBooks is up and running—see page 489.)
If you’re going to run QuickBooks and also want to store the company file on 
this computer to share with other QuickBooks jockeys, select “I’ll be using 
QuickBooks on this computer, AND I’ll be storing our company file here so it 
can be shared over our network.”
The third option, which begins with “I will NOT be using QuickBooks on this com­
puter,” is the one to choose when you’re installing the program on a computer 
that acts as a file server; in other words, a computer that stores your company 
files but doesn’t actually run QuickBooks (page 741). When you install the 
program using this option, you don’t use up one of your QuickBooks licenses.
7.	 On the “License and Product Numbers” screen, fill in the License Number 
and Product Number boxes, and then click Next.
These numbers are hard to miss—they’re in the confirmation email you received 
if you downloaded the program, or printed somewhere on your QuickBooks 
DVD packaging if you bought a physical copy. As you finish typing the digits in 
one box, your insertion point automatically jumps to the next box. So if you’re 
confident on the keyboard, you can keep your eyes on the email or yellow sticker 
and type all the digits for the license and product numbers without a break.
8.	 If you chose “Custom and Network options” in step 5, then you see the 
Choose Installation Location screen, shown in Figure A-1 (if you chose the 
Express option, you won’t see this screen, so skip to step 9); to change 
where QuickBooks will be installed, pick a new location, and then click Next.
Initially, the installation location is set to C:\Program Files \Intuit\QuickBooks 
2015 or C:\Program Files (x86)\Intuit\QuickBooks 2015 depending on whether 
your computer is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows. To choose an­
other spot, click Browse, select the new folder, and then click OK. If the folder 
you want to use doesn’t exist, click the New Folder icon, which looks like a 
stylized folder with a starburst on its corner. To view the folders one level up, 
click the icon that looks like a folder containing an up arrow. To select a folder 
within the box, double-click it or select it and then click OK.

This screen lists the program’s version, its license and product numbers, and 
the folder where it will be installed. If you want to change, say, the folder you’re 
installing to, click Back until you get to the appropriate screen, and then make 
your changes. Then click Next until you’re back at the “Ready to Install” screen.
When you click Install, your computer gets to work. The wizard shows the 
installation task it’s performing, and progress bars indicate how far it’s gotten.
The installation wizard also displays a User ID text box so you can sign into 
QuickBooks. If you don’t have an Intuit account yet or don’t want to log into the 
account you have, click “Skip this” at the window’s bottom right. If you do want 
to sign in to your Intuit account—for example, to register your copy of Quick­
Books, type your email address in the User ID box, and then click Validate. If 
QuickBooks finds your account, the password box appears. Type your password 
in the box, and then click Log In at the dialog box’s bottom right. 
 NOTE 	 If you see the “Register your product and get started” message, hop to page 740 to get the full scoop 
on registering your copy of the program. If you want to skip registration for now, click the Remind Me Later link 
at the window’s lower right.

Installing or Upgrading to a New Version of QuickBooks
If you already have a version of QuickBooks installed, it’s easy to install QuickBooks 
2015 or to upgrade your existing version. Here’s how:
1.	 Log into Windows as a user with administrator rights.
If you have trouble installing QuickBooks, try disabling your firewall. And shut 
down any running programs, including your virus-protection program (a good 
idea when you’re installing any software).
2.	 If you downloaded QuickBooks, double-click the file you downloaded. If 
you have a QuickBooks CD, put the disc in your CD drive.
Either way, QuickBooks’ installation dialog box appears on your screen and the 
installation wizard extracts the files it needs. This step can take a few minutes; 
you’ll see progress bars that give you an idea of how long the process will take. 
(If you’re installing from a CD and the dialog box doesn’t appear, use Windows 
Explorer to open the CD; double-click setup.exe, and then follow the onscreen 
instructions.)
3.	 When you see the Welcome screen in the QuickBooks installation dialog 
box, click Next.
The License Agreement screen appears.
4.	 After you read the software agreement carefully, turn on the “I accept the 
terms of the license agreement” checkbox, and then click Next.
You should always read software license agreements so you know the legal 
terms you’re accepting.
5.	 On the “Choose your installation type” screen, select either “Express 
(recommended)” or “Custom and Network options,” and then click Next.
The Express option sets up QuickBooks for single-user access (page 489) and 
installs the program in C:\Program Files\Intuit\QuickBooks 2015 for computers 
running a 32-bit version of Windows or C:\Program Files (x86)\Intuit\Quick­
Books 2015 for computers running 64-bit Windows. If you choose this option, the 
installer jumps to a screen that asks for the license and product numbers—hop 
to step 7 of this list for details. (You can change the preference to allow multiple 
users after QuickBooks is up and running; see page 489.)
The “Custom and Network options” setting lets you choose where to install 
QuickBooks on your computer, install the program and share a company file 
with others, or set up the computer only to share the company file (page 741). 
The next step explains your options.

Appendix A: Installing QuickBooks
739
INSTALLING 
QUICKBOOKS
6.	 If you selected the “Custom and Network options” setting, choose a setting 
on the “Custom and Network Options” screen, and then click Next.
If you’re the only person who uses QuickBooks, select “I’ll be using QuickBooks 
on this computer.” This option installs the program on your computer and sets it 
up for single-user access to your company file. (You can change this preference 
to allow multiple users once QuickBooks is up and running—see page 489.)
If you’re going to run QuickBooks and also want to store the company file on 
this computer to share with other QuickBooks jockeys, select “I’ll be using 
QuickBooks on this computer, AND I’ll be storing our company file here so it 
can be shared over our network.”
The third option, which begins with “I will NOT be using QuickBooks on this com­
puter,” is the one to choose when you’re installing the program on a computer 
that acts as a file server; in other words, a computer that stores your company 
files but doesn’t actually run QuickBooks (page 741). When you install the 
program using this option, you don’t use up one of your QuickBooks licenses.
7.	 On the “Enter your license and product numbers” screen, click the “Use 
your user ID instead” link below the Product Number boxes.
The “Install with your user ID” screen appears.
8.	 Fill in the User ID and Password boxes with your Intuit account user ID and 
password, and then click Next.
QuickBooks obtains your license and product number from the registration info 
associated with your Intuit account. 
If you can’t remember your account information, click the “Install with your 
product and license numbers instead” link to return to the “Enter your license 
and product numbers” screen, and then fill in the license number and product 
number from your confirmation email or CD.
9.	 If you want to keep your current version of QuickBooks and install Quick­
Books 2015 in addition, on the “Upgrade or Change Installation Location” 
screen, be sure to choose a different folder than the one where your current 
QuickBooks version is installed. Then jump to step 11.
Initially, the installation location is set to C:\Program Files\Intuit\QuickBooks 
2015 (for computers running a 32-bit version of Windows) or C:\Program Files 
(x86)\Intuit\QuickBooks 2015 (for computers running 64-bit Windows).
To change the installation location, click Browse, select the new folder, and then 
click OK. (You don’t have to change this location. To continue the installation 
without changing the location, simply proceed to step 11.)

or Change Installation Location” screen, select the “Replace the version 
selected below with the version I’m installing now” option and then, in the 
drop-down list, choose the version that you want to upgrade.
When you choose this option, the version you selected to replace will be unin­
stalled and QuickBooks 2015 will be installed.
11.	 Click Next. Then, as long as the settings in the “Ready to install” screen are 
the way you want, click Install.
This screen includes a summary of the program’s version, its license and product 
numbers, and the installation folder you chose. If you want to change, say, the 
folder you’re installing to, click Back until you get to the appropriate screen, 
and then make your changes. Then click Next until you’re back at the “Ready

When you click Install, your computer gets to work. The wizard shows the 
installation task it’s performing, and progress bars indicate how far it’s gotten.
 NOTE 	 If you see the “Register your product and get started” message, read the next section to learn how 
to register your copy of the program. Or you can skip registration for the time being by clicking the “I’ll do this later” 
link at the window’s lower right. But you have to register the program eventually, so go ahead and do it now.
12.	 When the Congratulations screen appears, click Open QuickBooks.
QuickBooks launches and you’re ready to start working. Chapter 1 walks you 
through launching QuickBooks subsequent times and opening files for day-
to-day work.
Registering QuickBooks
At some point after you’ve installed QuickBooks, you’ll see the Register QuickBooks 
dialog box. (You can also start the registration process by choosing Help→Register 
QuickBooks.) You don’t have to register QuickBooks immediately, but you’ll need to 
eventually—the program runs for only 60 days unless you register your copy. When 
you register, you’ll also receive any updates that Intuit releases for this version of 
the program.
In the Register QuickBooks dialog box, click the Begin Registration button. A browser 
window opens to the QuickBooks Registration page and guides you through the 
steps. Be sure to keep a copy of the license number, product number, telephone 
number, and Zip code you use for registration. You’ll need them if you have to rein­
stall QuickBooks or install it on a new hard drive.

Appendix A: Installing QuickBooks
741
WHERE TO 
STORE YOUR 
COMPANY 
FILES
Setting Up QuickBooks on a Network
For several people to work on the same company file from different computers, you 
have to perform two separate steps:
1.	 Install the QuickBooks database server on the machine where you store 
your QuickBooks files.
When you run the QuickBooks installer on this machine, on the “Custom and 
Network Options” screen, choose the option that begins with “I will NOT be 
using QuickBooks on this computer” (see step 6 on page 736). This installs the 
database server software so that the computer acts as a file server and doesn’t 
use up one of your QuickBooks licenses.
2.	 Install QuickBooks 2015 on all the computers that you want to run Quick­
Books, as explained earlier in this appendix.
You need a separate QuickBooks license for each computer on which you in­
stall the program. These computers need to be networked to the machine you 
use as the QuickBooks database server. They must all run the same version 
of QuickBooks (QuickBooks 2015, for example) and have permission to read, 
write, create, and delete in the folder where the company file resides. (A net­
work administrator typically sets up these permissions for each user. If you’re 
responsible for setting up users but you never wanted “network administrator” 
as your job title, in the Windows taskbar, choose Start→“Help and Support” 
and then, in the Search box, type share files to find instructions for sharing files 
using your operating system.)
 TIP 	 You can simplify access to the company-file folder by mapping a drive to that folder. In Windows’ “Help 
and Support” window (which you get to from your computer’s Start menu), search for “Map drive.”
QuickBooks Pro and Premier can handle up to five people accessing a company file 
at the same time. (Intuit is happy to sell you more than five licenses for QuickBooks 
to install on other people’s computers, but only five of the licensed users can work 
on the company file simultaneously.) QuickBooks Enterprise comes with 5-, 10-, or 
15-user license packs and allows up to 30 simultaneous users.
Where to Store Your Company Files
QuickBooks 2015 has its own favorite spot for company files, but you can save them 
wherever makes the most sense for your company. For example, if several people 
work on your company files simultaneously, choose the storage location that gives 
you the quickest performance (you’ll read about how to do that in a sec). 
In Windows 7 and Windows 8, QuickBooks automatically stores company files to C:\
Users\Public\Public Documents\Intuit\QuickBooks\Company Files, but you’re free 
to choose a different folder. You can store company files anywhere you like, so you 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL
742
WHERE TO 
STORE YOUR 
COMPANY 
FILES
may as well keep them with the rest of your documents. It also makes sense to cre­
ate a dedicated folder for your QuickBooks files since, in addition to company files, 
you’ll probably create backup files, message templates, files that you export from 
QuickBooks, and files for importing into your company file. With a QuickBooks folder 
as a container, you can create subfolders for each type of file, as shown in Figure A-2.
FIGURE A-2
Having a subfolder for each type of QuickBooks-
related file (backups, export files, and so on) 
makes it easy to find what you want. If you save a 
copy of your company file at the end of each year, 
you can create subfolders for each year, too.
 TIP 	 If you aren’t totally at ease working with files in your computer’s operating system, Windows 7: The 
Missing Manual, Windows 8: The Missing Manual, or Windows 8.1: The Missing Manual will make you an expert in 
no time.
Storing Company Files on a Network
If several people work on your company files, where you store those files can de­
termine whether those people get blisteringly fast responses or nod off waiting for 
processes to complete. For the best performance, put company files on the network 
computer with the most memory, the fastest processor, the most available disk space, 
and—ideally—the least amount of activity. The best location for your company file 
depends on the type of network you use:
• Peer-to-peer networks don’t use dedicated file servers, so you can store your 
company file on any computer on the network. The computers running Quick­
Books need to use Windows Server, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.

Appendix A: Installing QuickBooks
743
WHERE TO 
STORE YOUR 
COMPANY 
FILES
• On a client-server network, the company file typically resides on a file server, 
a dedicated computer for sharing files. Every computer on the network that has 
QuickBooks installed can access the company files, but one of the computers 
has to host multi-user access (page 489). Intuit recommends installing Quick­
Books, QuickBooks Database Manager, and the company files on the server, 
which has to run Windows Server, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.
However, in some cases, you can’t install QuickBooks on the computer that holds the 
company files (if you use a file server, for instance). You have to log into the computer 
that you want to use as the host and open company files in multi-user mode (page 
489). When QuickBooks asks if you want this computer to host multi-user access, 
click Yes. This computer then plays traffic cop for several people working on the 
company files at the same time.
 TIP 	 When you perform resource-gobbling tasks, like running massive reports or reconciling accounts, 
performance is paramount. On a peer-to-peer network, when you need to perform these tough tasks, log into 
QuickBooks on the computer that holds the company files. On a client-server network, use the fastest computer 
on the network.

etween questions about how to do something in QuickBooks and how to 
handle something in accounting, you might need help occasionally. Happily, the 
QuickBooks Help system can actually help. When you open QuickBooks Help, 
it automatically shows links to topics relevant to what you’re doing in the program. 
For example, if the Create Invoices window is open, QuickBooks Help tells you how 
to fill out or edit invoices, record payments toward invoices, customize your invoice 
form, and so on. You’ll find topics with background info, troubleshooting tips, and 
even advice on why you should or shouldn’t perform certain steps.
Another option is the Intuit Community. As its name suggests, this help comes from 
fellow QuickBooks wranglers. They use the program every day just like you and can 
help uncover solutions, not to mention lots of helpful tricks and tips. If you don’t see 
a question and answer similar to the question you have, you can post your question. 
And if you’re a QuickBooks veteran, you can answer someone else’s plea for help.
In this appendix, you’ll learn your way around QuickBooks Help. And, in case you 
want more help than you find there, you’ll also learn about other resources that 
might do the trick.
QuickBooks Help
Wherever you are in the program, you can get help by pressing F1 or choosing 
Help→QuickBooks Help. The “Have a Question?” window opens and displays a list 
of how-to and troubleshooting topics related to the feature you’re using, as shown 
in Figure B-1. (If the “Have a Question?” window is already open, the topics don’t 
change as you click menu entries, display windows, and open dialog boxes.) When

you click a topic link in the “Have a Question?” window, it displays that help topic 
(Figure B-2).
FIGURE B-1
No matter how many words you type in the text box 
at the top of this window, QuickBooks Help lists a 
handful of topics that relate to them. If none of the 
results sound promising, click Show More Results to 
view additional topics. 
You can minimize and maximize the QuickBooks 
Help window, drag it outside the QuickBooks main 
window, and resize it.
The other way to find a help topic is to type search terms into the text box at the 
top of the “Have a Question?” window, and then press Enter or click the Search but­
ton (it has a magnifying glass on it), as shown in Figure B-1. The “Answers in Help” 
section lists QuickBooks help articles. The “Answers from Community” section is 
described on page 748.

 TIP 	 If you use either icon bar, you can look for answers using the Search box, which is at the top of the 
left icon bar and at the right end of the top icon bar. (If you use the top icon bar and don’t see the Search box, 
choose Edit→Preferences→Search and, on the My Preferences tab, turn on the “Show Search field in the Icon 
Bar” checkbox.) To search for help, type keywords or a question in the Search box, choose Help in the box’s drop-
down menu that appears, and then press Enter or click the Search button, which looks like a magnifying glass.
FIGURE B-2
When you click a topic in the “Have a Question?” 
window, it displays a Help article like the one shown 
here, with information, instructions, and additional 
links to related topics. If you click several links, you 
may quickly find yourself several topics from where 
you started. To navigate back to previous topics, 
click the left arrow (Back) at the top of the window.
 TIP 	 You can jump back to search terms you typed in previously by clicking the down arrow on the Search 
box’s right side and then choosing the search you want.
Intuit Community
Intuit Community is the name of Intuit’s QuickBooks community message boards. 
The system is simple to use: You ask a question, and the program checks whether 
it’s already been answered by someone else who uses QuickBooks. (You can’t 
control the answers that Intuit Community displays. You’ll see different responses 
depending on how you phrase your question, so go ahead and try different word­
ings.) If none of the answers it finds are what you want, you can pose your question 

QUICKBOOKS 2015: THE MISSING MANUAL

INTUIT 
COMMUNITY
to the community. By the same token, you can post your solutions to questions that 
others have asked. 
 TIP 	 If you want to scan existing questions and answers, see the Tip on page 750 to learn how to review the 
Intuit Community message boards without QuickBooks’ help.
You can browse questions and answers in the community to your heart’s content, 
but you need an Intuit User ID to submit your own questions or post answers. The 
first time you submit a post, Intuit Community asks you to sign in. If you didn’t set 
up an Intuit account when you installed QuickBooks, you can do that now.
Accessing the Community Within QuickBooks
Here’s how to use Intuit Community from within QuickBooks:
1.	 Choose Help→QuickBooks Help or press F1.
The “Have a Question?” window opens and displays a list of topics related to 
the feature you’re using. 
2.	 If the feature you’re using is what you need help with, in the “Have a Ques­
tion?” window, look for results in the “Answers from Community” section. 
If you have a question about something else, type keywords in the Search 
field, and then click the search icon (it looks like a magnifying glass).
The “Have a Question?” window displays links to answers from QuickBooks 
Help and the Intuit Community. When you point your cursor at some blue result 
text, the cursor changes to a pointing finger to indicate that the text is a link 
(the fact that the text is blue is another clue). To see additional answers, click 
“Show more answers” in the middle of the window or “Show more community 
answers” at the bottom.
3.	 If you see a question in the “Answers from Community” section that sounds 
like yours, click it.
QuickBooks opens a browser window behind the “Have a Question? window. 
To get a clear view of the browser window (shown in Figure B-3), minimize the 
“Have a Question?” window. 
4.	 If you find your answer, click the X at the browser window’s top right to 
close it and skip the remaining steps.
5.	 If this answer isn’t what you’re looking for, click links in the Similar Ques­
tions section at the bottom of the browser window.
The browser window displays that question and all its answers. Alternatively, 
you can type search terms in the Search box at the top of the browser window; 
enter a detailed question or description of your problem, and then press Enter or 
click the magnifying glass icon to the box’s right. After you do that, the window 
lists results that match what you typed.

shown here.
6.	 To ask a question of your own, type it in the “Have a new question?” box on 
the window’s right, and then click Ask.
Based on the words you used in your question, the window lists results that 
might answer your question. Click a blue question link to view the question

7.	 If none of the results is what you want, scroll to the bottom of the window 
and click the “Submit your question” link.
If you aren’t signed into your Intuit account, the “Sign in or create an account” 
box appears. Click the “Sign in” button. On the “Sign in” page, fill in the Intuit 
user ID and password, and then click the Sign In button.
On the screen that appears, in the “Your question” box, type a brief but meaning­
ful title for your question to help people find it. Click the “Select your product” 
down arrow and choose the product your question applies to. In the “Select a 
topic” drop-down list, choose a topic category. In the “Add more details” box, 
provide a clear and complete question or description of your issue so you’re 
likely to get a relevant answer. You can even attach an image file to your post 
by clicking the Attach button at the bottom of the page. When everything looks 
good, click Submit.

OTHER KINDS 
OF HELP
After that, you simply wait for someone to answer your question. But you don’t have 
to constantly check the Intuit Community site to see if someone responds; when 
you’re logged into your Intuit account, you can set things up so that you get emails 
when someone answers your Intuit Community questions. To do so, at the top right 
of the Intuit Community web page, click the icon that looks like a silhouette (or your 
photo, if you attached one to your account) and choose Notification Settings. On 
the screen that appears, make sure the “someone replies to a post you’re following” 
checkbox is turned on.
When someone posts a response to your question, you’ll get a notification email. 
Click the link in the email to see the response on the Intuit Community site. If the 
person solved your problem, you can click the Yes button to the right of the “Was 
this answer helpful?” label.
 TIP 	 If you’d rather scan the QuickBooks community message boards in your browser, go to https://community.
intuit.com/quickbooks, where you’ll see high-level topics like “Accounting, Banking & Taxes,” Inventory, Canada, 
and “Vendors & Paying Others.” Click one of the categories to see all the posts related to it. You can search existing 
questions and answers or post your own question using a process similar to the one described above.
Other Kinds of Help
Unsurprisingly, the first item on the Help menu is QuickBooks Help. However, items 
further down the menu may provide the assistance you want, depending on your 
level of experience and how you like to learn:
• Learning Center Tutorials. Choose this option to open the QuickBooks Learning 
Center window and watch video tutorials about popular tasks. For example, in 
the window’s navigation bar, click the Tracking Money In icon to access tutorials 
for creating invoices, sales receipts, and payments. The tutorials are generally 
a few minutes long, so don’t expect in-depth training. An audio track explains 
what’s going on as you see the cursor move around the screen, buttons highlight, 
and windows or dialog boxes open and close.
• Support. This option opens a browser window to the Intuit QuickBooks Support 
web page. Below the “How can we help?” heading, you can click a link to view 
popular support topics, read answers from the Intuit Community, or find a local 
QuickBooks expert to help you. Or you can type something in the “Type your 
question, or error code” box, and then press Enter or click the Search button. 
(For example, if you receive an error message, type in the error number to find 
out what it means and what you can do about it.) The page that appears displays 
articles from a variety of sources, including the program’s Troubleshooting and 
How To articles, the Intuit Community, YouTube, and so on. The box on page 
752 tells you more about QuickBooks Support options.

Appendix B: Help, Support, and Other Resources
751
OTHER HELP 
RESOURCES
• Find A Local QuickBooks Expert. If you’re tired of figuring things out on your 
own, you can find plenty of accountants and bookkeepers who are QuickBooks 
experts—and you’ll be glad you did. Clicking this option opens a web browser 
to the QuickBooks Find-a-ProAdvisor website so you can find someone in your 
area. (Alternatively, you can point your web browser to http://accountants.in­
tuit.com/accounting/proadvisor.) ProAdvisors have passed Intuit’s certification 
exams to prove their QuickBooks expertise. Finding one of these folks is free, 
but a ProAdvisor’s services aren’t, so when you find ProAdvisors near you, ask 
about their fees before hiring them. 
• Send Feedback Online. This option won’t provide instant gratification for your 
QuickBooks problems, although telling Intuit what you think may make you 
feel better. You can use this option to send suggestions for improvements to 
QuickBooks or QuickBooks Help and report any bugs you find.
Other Help Resources
If you don’t find an answer to your questions in QuickBooks Help or the Intuit Com­
munity forums, you can use Google or another search engine to search online, or 
try an independent QuickBooks message board. QuickBooksUsers.com (http://
forums.quickbooksusers.com) has forums for different editions of the program, 
including one each for QuickBooks overall, QuickBooks Pro, Premier Nonprofit, 
Premier Manufacturing and Wholesale, Enterprise, and QuickBooks for Mac. You 
can also find forums for the Australian, Canadian, and UK editions of the program. 
People post some gnarly problems on these message boards, but each question 
gets at least one reply. In some cases, you might receive several different solutions 
to the same problem.
 TIP 	 When you have a question or receive an error message in QuickBooks, typing the question, error mes­
sage, or error number into a web search engine is a great way to find answers.
The QuickBooksUsers.com message boards are free. This site supports itself by sell­
ing data-recovery services and tech support. (Then again, a data-recovery service 
might be just what you need.) If you’re looking for an add-on program or having 
problems with one, check out the site’s QuickBooks 3rd Party Software Forum.
You might also consider joining a LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) group related to 
QuickBooks. These groups have thousands of members, any of whom may chime in 
to help resolve your burning QuickBooks issues. The Expert QuickBooks Help group 
is run by Laura Madeira, a consultant, trainer and author on all things QuickBooks. 
Ruth Perryman, president of The QB Specialists—an Intuit Solutions Provider—runs 
the QuickBooks Tips & Tricks group. Laura and Ruth are both Advanced Certified 
QuickBooks ProAdvisors and members of Intuit’s Trainer/Writer Network.

Getting Answers from Intuit
If you choose Help→Support, and then, in the horizontal 
navigation bar, click Contact Us, you’ll see a web page with 
categories that you can click. But those simply display links to 
troubleshooting and how-to articles on the QuickBooks Support 
site (page 750). To get to an Intuit phone number, you have to 
perform a few more steps. For example, choose the “Download, 
install, register” category, click the View Support Option button 
on the screen’s right, and then click the Contact Us button that 
appears. You’ll see a telephone number you can call, although 
the screen warns you that charges may apply.
Here is the rundown of free versus for-a-fee support (although 
this can change at any time):
• Help is free for 12 months after you register your copy of 
QuickBooks 2013, 2014, and 2015—if the problem has to do 
with installing or upgrading QuickBooks, error messages 
that tell you to contact Intuit support (or that contain a 
6xxx code), and some questions related to setting up a 
multi-user environment.
• Support plans come with monthly or yearly subscriptions. 
If you think you’ll want to call support several times, a 
support plan is more cost-effective than paying for each 
call. One way to obtain a support plan is to buy QuickBooks 
Pro Plus and QuickBooks Premier Plus, which include one. 
For example, go to http://quickbooks.intuit.com/pro and 
click Pricing for the full story.
• If you’re reinstalling QuickBooks and can’t find your 
license number, in QuickBooks 2015, you can fill in your 
Intuit account info to grab your license number from 
your registration record (page 740). If that doesn’t work, 
go to http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/
LicenseNumber/Default.aspx. There you can type in the 
business phone number you used to register QuickBooks 
or sign in using your Intuit account, and you’ll see all the 
products associated with your account and the license 
and product number for each one.
