Foreword
If you're reading this book, that means that you're about to
embark on a potentially life-changing journey.
There's a good chance that a 3D printer will wind up in your
home, if it hasn't already, and you're going to need to know how
to use it.
Getting Started with 3D Printing can be your guide through the
trials and tribulations of the 3D printing learning curve.
When you begin, you may not know a thing about this game-
changing technology, but as you follow along with this book, you
will be initiated into an elite society of alchemists who are capa-
ble of transforming the very matter of the physical world around
you. Like me, you will become a maker.
Makers date back tens of thousands of years. While Neander-
thals were roaming around the plains of the Serengeti, dragging
their knuckles through the dirt, we makers were learning to
transform sticks, stones, and animal bones into tools with which
to hunt and survive. By the time some made rocks with handles,
we makers had already moved on to bronze, smelting spear-
heads, and proto-writing our names into mountaintops.
The times have changed, but our powers have not.
The newest generation of makers wield the tools of digital fabri-
cation to transmute thought into reality. The CNC machine
carves metal, the laser cutter etches wood, and the PCB writer
harnesses the power of electricity to drive even the most com-
plex of robotics. But there may be no tool of alchemy more pow-
erful than the 3D printer.
I can tell you from personal experience that learning how to 3D
print may not always be fun, but it will always be rewarding. I
remember watching my first test cube begin printing, and it was
nothing short of miraculous. I had found the digital model on

Thingiverse and, all of a sudden, it was materializing before my
eyes.
Life, when you love 3D printing, can be a tumultuous one of
clogged print heads, broken belt drives, and unruly 3D CAD
models. There is hope, but you have to start somewhere. And
there's no better place to start than with this book, written by
two educational alchemists—Liza Wallach Kloski and Nick Kloski
of HoneyPoint3D™.
They have already empowered more than 6,000 apprentices,
having successfully launched their own wildly popular educa-
tional program devoted to teaching the ins and outs of 3D print-
ing. Liza and Nick will be able to accompany you on your journey
as two helpful guides who will be there for you when your wires
are crossed, your extruders are clogged, and your bed isn't level.
Soon, you will understand how to turn the mental into the physi-
cal, the digital into the material. You'll be able to clone everyday
items, teleport them across thousands of miles, or reconfigure
them to suit your own needs. You'll befriend other mystics, like
yourself, who can help you to hone your powers. You might even
join a local chapter of the elders, a makerspace, where secret
rites and rituals will see you unite your powers with the collec-
tive to unleash even mightier projects on the world at large. And
as the technology grows more powerful as a result, you'll be
able to fabricate almost anything, practically out of thin air,
moving from full color sculptures to complete electronic devi-
ces!
That is what you can expect when you end your journey. Once
you complete this guide, you, my friend, will become one of the
initiated. You will be a maker.

An Introduction to
3D Printing
Feel fortunate! You are living at a time when technology is
increasingly helping people become masters of their environ-
ments. A 3D printer puts the power of a manufacturing plant on
your desk and opens worlds of opportunities that you (and the
rest of humanity) have never experienced before.
Industrial 3D printing has been around since the 1980s. The
technology became available to hobbyists and consumers in
2009 when the RepRap project brought together thinkers and
coders from around the world to create a freely open codebase.
This gave anyone the ability to build a personal 3D printer, such
as the very early example shown in Figure P-1.
Using an open source design (which grants a free license to a
product's blueprints), dedicated hobbyists were able to afforda-
bly access what was otherwise a very expensive technology.
This marked a cornerstone in the ability of ordinary customers
to access desktop 3D printing.
Fast-forward to 2016. The 3D printing industry (industrial and
consumer combined) is now estimated at around $7 billion and
is expected to exceed $17.2 billion by 2020. No one has a crystal
ball to know the future, but it seems certain that 3D printing will
change the way we as a society design and manufacture physi-
cal items.

How 3D Printing Works
The most common type of consumer 3D printing, also known as
"additive manufacturing," is called FDM (fused deposition mod-
eling) or sometimes FFF (fused filament fabrication). FDM print-
ers create objects by adding material in successive layers, build-
ing up an object layer by layer over time. A thin strand of fila-
ment feeds into a part of the machine called an extruder, which
melts the plastic at a high temperature—typically around
200°C. There are many other methods of 3D printing that this
book will cover in later chapters, and they all work in the same
"additive" way of creating an object by adding material layer by
layer.
The most recognizable tool you can compare this process to is a
hot glue gun. You probably have one at home and have used it
for craft or school projects. When you squeeze the handle, the
glue is pressed against a heating element and soft, spaghetti-
like strands extrude from the nozzle. Imagine swirling those
strands around and around on top of each other, forming circles
that build up into a tube. As the glue cools, it hardens.
Following the glue gun analogy, in a 3D printer the thin strand of
melted plastic is laid down, layer by layer, on a flat surface where
it cools and hardens into an object. The image in Figure P-2 pro-
vides a closer look at how this technology works.
Most consumer 3D printers use FDM technology and have a
large spool of coiled plastic called filament attached to them.
(We will talk about other types of 3D printer technologies in later
chapters.)
The 3D printer knows precisely where to trace each layer
through instructions in a digital file sent from a computer.

3D Printing Is Not Like 2D Printing
In 2013, at our retail 3D printing store in Oakland, California, we
used to get a lot of questions from casual visitors along the lines
of, "Where do you put the ink?" and "How much paper does it
need?" The majority of the public hadn't made the connection
that 3D printers (which print three-dimensional objects) are
very different from 2D printers (which print flat images on
paper).
Today, ninety percent of our store visitors—from all age groups,
backgrounds, and interests—know the difference between 2D
printing and 3D printing. 3D printing has received a tremendous
amount of media attention these past few years, and the gen-
xii An Introduction to 3D Printing

eral public has made a huge leap in awareness of the technol-
ogy.
3D printing is, therefore, a paradigm shift from our traditional
understanding of printing based on paper-and-ink printers. You
can't print a "flat" graphical image such as a PDF or JPEG in 3D. 
A special kind of digital file is needed to make a 3D print. That
type of file is called a 3D model. We will go into more details
about 3D models later in this book.
Managing Expectations as You
Start Your Journey
3D printing is more difficult than it should be. The technology is
still relatively young, and the machines are not as plug-and-play
as most home appliances, like a microwave oven. Expect to go
through a learning curve where good old trial-and-error will give
you lots of valuable experience and, eventually, success! You will
learn the tricks of the trade as you go. Here are some common
experiences you should expect:
Prints fail
A lot. Especially when you are first learning. Did you set the
wrong temperature? Did the 3D file have errors in it? Was
the print bed not level? You'll be asking yourself these ques-
tions and more as you experiment.
Prints take a long time
Want to print a phone case? No problem! But the print will
likely take 3+ hours.
Printers need ongoing maintenance
Motor belts pop off. The hot end gets jammed. Stuff hap-
pens and, in most cases, it will be you fixing it.
Sometimes prints need pre/postprocessing
Some 3D model files you find on the Internet can't be
printed as-is and will need to be fixed. Printed 3D objects will
need work to get the smooth surface you may desire. (You
will find that sandpaper does wonders with those rough
edges on a newly hatched 3D print.)
An Introduction to 3D Printing xiii

Don't Worry! This Is Why We Wrote
the Book
3D printing isn't just a technology, it's an ecosystem of software
and hardware. Implementing 3D printing takes a three-pronged
approach: education, CAD file generation, and the physical
aspect of 3D printing. You'll get a basic grasp of this system by
reading this book. The rewards of learning how to 3D print are
well worth the learning curve, and you'll be glad you made the
effort. Reading this book will save you time, money, headaches,
and heartaches and will lessen the number of "valuable lessons"
you have to go through on your own. We made plenty of mis-
takes so you won't have to!
What's in This Book?
Getting Started with 3D Printing offers you a clear roadmap of
best practices to help you successfully bring 3D printing into
your home, classroom, or workplace. We hope you will find it a
fun, practical guide that will help you navigate your way from ini-
tial curiosity to active, hands-on 3D printing. The book is
intended for those who have no prior experience in 3D printing.
Even if you do have some experience with 3D printing, however,
you may find that the book will help you see a bigger picture and
greater possibilities.

PART I
Applications of 3D
Printing


1/You Say You Want
a Revolution?
There is no doubt that the rise of 3D printing is laying the foun-
dation for a significant change in our society, one that will have
important echoes in the coming years and decades. This chap-
ter gives you a short historical perspective on the manufactur-
ing roots of 3D printing and how it currently affects our lives.
The rise of 3D printing is being heralded by some as the begin-
ning of a "third industrial revolution," but we feel it is better
called the "personal manufacturing revolution"—a term attrib-
uted to Avi Reichental, former CEO & President of 3D Systems.
The first and second industrial revolutions developed new man-
ufacturing processes that included going from hand production
methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing processes,
increased use of steam power, the creation of machine tools,
and mass production (Figure 1-1). The second industrial revolu-
tion, which introduced assembly lines, continues to affect how
we manufacture goods today.
These two revolutions marked major turning points in history;
almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way.
Average incomes and population numbers began to exhibit
unprecedented growth, and the standard of living rose for most
people.
3D printing, like its fabrication predecessors, has created new
manufacturing processes, and it promises to change not just
manufacturing but our way of life. The key difference is that this
new manufacturing technology is very personal. Essentially, it is
a factory on your desk, where you can make almost anything
you wish. You can manifest your ideas in ways that were once
only available through industrial prototyping. You don't need
permission from a board of directors or even orders from cus-
3

tomers to produce new products. You just need your imagina-
tion.
Figure 1-1. Woman working in yarn mill, showing mass produc-
tion circa 1900
This is why we and many others believe "personal manufactur-
ing revolution" is a more fitting term for the changes 3D printing
will bring. It shifts the focus to the individual, showcasing self-
expression and self-sufficiency.
A Manufacturing Full Circle
3D printing won't completely replace traditional manufacturing
processes. Rather, it will augment current means of mass pro-
duction. In addition, the centers of manufacturing have come
full circle with 3D printing. You can now manufacture either in
rural or urban areas, production can move back from the factory
to the small shop, and you can economically produce one piece
or many. In this way, 3D printing has combined the best aspects
of pre- and post-revolution manufacturing, as shown in
Figure 1-2.

periods and shows how manufacturing has come full circle (info-

You Say You Want a Revolution? 5

3D printing technology will inevitably change the world of manu-
facturing. Local design and production can be quick, efficient,
and environmentally conscious. It can also produce highly cus-
tomized products. Because each 3D print is made individually,
modifications can be added between 3D prints (something that
mass manufacturing cannot do easily).
In the next chapter, we'll examine how 3D printing is helping
drive the maker movement.
6 Getting Started with 3D Printing

2/3D Printing and the
Maker Movement
Many people find the act of making very satisfying. New, inex-
pensive, and more readily available technologies are allowing
makers and DIYers to do things they couldn't do before. Inex-
pensive 3D printers are enabling ordinary people to make their
own jewelry, toys, mechanical parts, and many other items.
Impact of the Maker Movement
The "maker movement," an extension of the DIY community,
has had a tremendous influence in promoting consumer aware-
ness of 3D printing. Hundreds of thousands of people have
learned about 3D printers and saw them in operation for the
first time at Maker Faires. Figure 2-1 shows attendees at a local
Mini Maker Faire listening to our lecture on 3D printing.
No matter what experience level you have, you can be a maker,
too. And, as you will discover in this chapter, a whole ecosystem
of companies, organizations, and services are available to help
you use 3D printing to foster that ability in you.
Who Is a Maker?
Millions of people each year attend Maker Faires. So, who are
these makers?
A maker is anyone who puts things together creatively. Look
around you, makers are everywhere. The do-it-yourselfer mak-
ing a wood door for his house is a maker. The hobbyist assem-
bling a flying drone from a kit is a maker. A programmer devel-
oping an Arduino-based electronic device is a maker. They are
all making something new by using their hands and creativity,
turning their ideas into physical forms.
7

Figure 2-1. Nick Kloski making a presentation on 3D printing at
the East Bay Mini Maker Faire, Oakland, California, 2015
In fact, you probably already are a maker in your daily life!
Maybe something broke in your kitchen and you hacked some-
thing together to make it work again...you're a maker! The chil-
dren in schools making their 7th grade science project...they are
makers too! You don't have to have a garage full of tools to be a
maker, you just need to think and build creatively.
Figure 2-2 shows some examples of how consumers, turned
makers, are using 3D printing today.
As you tinker and experiment with this technology, you will
undoubtedly find ways to use 3D printing to enhance your life. In
fact, a study from Michigan Technological University estimated
that a family can save anywhere from $300 to almost $2,000 a
year by 3D printing items such as combs, cookie cutters, door
stops, tool parts, and more. It's easy to see how 3D printing has
found a happy home in the maker movement.

How the 3D Printing Ecosystem
Helps You Be a Maker
An entire ecosystem of products and services is being devel-
oped around this technology. Whether you are a maker, investor,
business startup, or just testing the waters, it's important to be
aware of the larger landscape of companies and services that
make up the current 3D printing ecosystem.
Consumer-level 3D printing has only been around for a relatively
short time, but the realm of related goods and services is grow-
ing very quickly. Figures 2-3 through 2-6 provide a list of com-
pany names as well as functional descriptions of the types of
services and products you will encounter. You don't have to
master all aspects of 3D printing yourself; you'll see that you
can download ready-made 3D models, hire 3D design and CAD
services, outsource the 3D printing to a service bureau, or pur-
chase 3D printed objects. How you want to approach it is up to
you!
The list of companies and services mentioned here is not com-
prehensive, but rather an overview of what you can expect to
encounter in the 3D printing world. For a more comprehensive
list, visit the online 3D Printing Directory.
In the next chapter we'll examine some of the ways that 3D
printing is being used today to provide greater choice in con-
sumer items, better health care, and more. You'll see that 3D
printing is already having an important impact on our society.

3/How 3D Printing Is
Being Used Today
Makers are not the only ones using this technology to further
advancements in every area of life. Companies and other organi-
zations have adopted elements of 3D printing to enhance,
improve, and even create their products and services. Nothing
makes a new technology more real than when you see it being
used in everyday life.
In this chapter we'll look briefly at some of the innovative ways
individuals and organizations are currently offering 3D printing
technology and why it's gaining more momentum.
Rapid Prototyping for Your Ideas,
Designs, and Inventions
Have you ever wanted to drive a car that had a steering wheel
made just for you? Or how about door handles that were made
to resemble the favorite rowing oar you used in college? You can
have it made with 3D printing. In fact, Figure 3-1 shows that you
can even customize a whole car with 3D printing.
Maybe you don't need a 3D printed car, but what about a per-
sonalized 3D printed luggage tag or a replacement doorknob?
Rapid prototyping is defined as the ability to quickly fabricate a
model of a physical part using three-dimensional computer
aided design (CAD) software. 3D printing is ideal for rapid proto-
typing in that you can make changes quickly and produce a
sample of one, saving time and money.
15

Figure 3-1. Detroit, January 2012, Local Motors Strati, a 3D
printed concept car using rapid prototyping (Steve Lagreca,

In the rapid prototyping division of our company, we see hun-
dreds of people just like you looking at ways to invent and per-
sonalize the objects around them. They often come to us with
hand drawings, a physical prototype they made by hand, or even
just ideas! We then translate this information into a CAD model
(i.e., a digital file). The first 3D print lets our clients test the
design. If adjustments are needed, we modify the CAD file and
then 3D print the next version. This process continues until the
client is happy. Figure 3-2 shows an example of how one of our
clients turned an idea into a phenomenally successful promo-
tional giveaway she gives to her website's membership. Individ-
uals, small businesses, and large corporations everywhere can
now customize products in small production runs.
Do you have an invention? Think of your possibilities! Instead of
expensive tooling costs that can run into the tens of thousands
of dollars, you can now test your ideas with a 3D printer and, in
many cases, get your first prototype for under $10 USD per 3D
print. And because changing an aspect of the design in a CAD
modeling program is easy, each and every object can be subtly
different for each buyer. This is something injection molding
either cannot do or would require extensive postprocessing in
order to achieve.

bers
Never before has there been such a versatile manufacturing tool
that is so accessible to the masses. Your rapid prototype could
be an iteration of a design or the final product. It's up to you!
Forward-Thinking Companies Are
Actively Bringing You 3D Printing
As of this writing, companies are offering ways to let customers
participate in 3D printing. For example, Lowe's Innovation Labs,
a subsidiary of the hardware store giant Lowe's, launched a cus-
tomer 3D printing initiative in its Mountain View, California,
Orchard Supply Hardware store in 2015. This program allows
you to work with a Lowe's specialist and design your own hard-
ware items, such as the knob shown in Figure 3-3. Lowe's hard-
ware stores are now providing a venue for you to create with
them. You can start with an existing design or make one from
scratch, making a version of something into existence that was
not there before. It's your something, your version, your twist.
How 3D Printing Is Being Used Today 17

In 2013, The UPS Store, the world's largest franchisor of retail
shipping, postal, printing, and business service centers with
over 4,800 locations in the United States and Canada, started
offering local in-store 3D printing services using the Stratasys
uPrint SE Plus 3D printer. Now more than 62 UPS Store loca-
tions across the country offer up to "same day" 3D printing
services to thousands of their customers. The retail giant is
expected to expand its 3D printing capabilities in 2016
(Figure 3-4). Overnight, The UPS Store brought local 3D printing
to a national level.

Don't Worry. It Won't Cost You
More. Complexity Is Free
Will companies charge you more for complexity? When you buy
something, it's almost always the case that the more complex or
ornate versions cost more. This is not true with 3D printing. You
don't need to pay more for the highly complicated, complex
designs. The 3D printer just "reads" where to put the material...
it doesn't "care" if it's simple or complex. The 3D printer just
registers how much material is being used, not how intricate the
design is.
This is another reason why 3D printing is important. Companies
and you can now design highly complex objects (Figure 3-5)
that were once impossible to make with traditional manufactur-
ing techniques such as injection molding.

it, all 3D printed in one step. The ball inside actually moves and
is independent of the outer layer!

3D Printing Is Advancing Health
Care
Have you heard of a company called Invisalign? It manufactures
invisible dental braces that are perfectly formed to the shape of
your own teeth. Each plastic tray is custom and no two are alike
(see Figure 3-7). Dentists make 3D printed molds of your teeth
as your alignment changes (hopefully for the better) and then
this company produces the braces that are placed on your
teeth. Invisalign makes more than 17 million sets of braces a
year. New medical applications using 3D printing are being
developed by other companies for hip replacements, prosthet-
ics, and more! Not only can you use 3D printing in your life, but it
can be a part of you, literally!

in order to make invisible plastic teeth aligners for patients

3D Printing Has a Sole
You know the sore feeling your feet have after walking around all
day. Some people have even more special needs for their feet
due to medical conditions. The answer to alleviating that pain is
often custom orthotics, but those are commonly expensive and
take some time to produce. A company in Europe called SUN-
feet wants to help reduce the amount of a fatigue both your feet
and wallet have by providing 3D printed insoles at a fraction of
the cost and length of time to produce. Rather than a lengthy
fitting and hand fabrication process to receive custom orthotics,
a person just has to stand in a 3D foot scanning booth and a 3D
model of the foot is made instantly. The 3D model is then used
to fabricate a custom insole that is lighter, cheaper, and manu-
factured more quickly than traditional techniques (Figure 3-8).
Figure 3-8. A custom-fitted 3D printed orthotic. The holes are
for aesthetics as well as weight reduction, and make those areas
slightly more flexible, as dictated by the needs of the patient
(photo credit: SUNfeet.es).
22 Getting Started with 3D Printing

3D printing is ushering in an era of personal mass customiza-
tion. From custom orthotics to custom orthopedics, this tech-
nology can create hundreds of thousands of unique items for
customers with all of the complex work being taken care of
through the software. And the manufacturing is done on-
demand, right when you order it! The capabilities demonstrated
by these examples illustrate why 3D printing is becoming
increasingly relevant in your day-to-day life.
In the next chapter, we'll dive into the hands-on part of this book
by describing the most prevalent consumer 3D printing technol-
ogy: fused deposition modeling, or FDM for short. Turn the page
to learn more!
How 3D Printing Is Being Used Today 23


PART II
Hardware and
Printing Choices


4/Understanding
FDM Printers
There are two main types of consumer 3D printers: those that
use filament for fused deposition modeling (called FDM) and
those that use resin for stereolithography (called SLA). In this
chapter, we will describe FDM technology, which is used in the
most common consumer-level 3D printers. The next chapter will
talk about SLA printers.
Consumer 3D printers only became readily available around
2009, with much of the growth starting in 2012. Because this
industry is so new, you can still see the "roots" of where it origi-
nated. As we mentioned in the preface, many (if not all) of the
consumer printers being used today came from a community-
driven project called the RepRap Project.
RepRap stands for "Replicating Rapid Prototyper." You can learn
more about it at RepRap.org. This "Project" is a global commu-
nity of tech-savvy people that came together to work on 3D
printer hardware and software. It seeks to create and refine
freely available 3D printer designs and to democratize user
access to this world-changing technology. They donated their
time and work to the world, and to you.
The first RepRap Project focused on the FDM printer. Many of
the current components and manufacturing techniques came
from the original work of the RepRap Project. While 3D printer
kits that you assemble yourself are still available, you can now
buy fully assembled units that are designed to be usable right
out of the box. The heritage of the RepRap kit tradition is alive
and well, though. If you do decide to build your own printer, you
can do so by sourcing all of the parts yourself, or you can pur-
chase a "kit" where you follow assembly instructions.
27

Any FDM printer will have the components shown in Figure 4-1:
• Filament
• Extruder or extruder assembly
• Build plate / build area
• Linear movement components
• Frame / chassis
• Controller unit
Figure 4-1. Anatomy of an FDM 3D printer modeled after a
Printrbot (infographic by Jeff Hansen, HoneyPoint3D™)
28 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Here's a basic description of what the parts of an FDM printer
do:
• The build plate (or print bed) is a level, flat area where the 3D
print starts.
• A filament spool holds the plastic that will be melted.
• Thin filament, usually a type of thermoplastic, is wrapped
around a filament spool and is the raw material the 3D
printer uses to make objects. Consumer printers print with
filament that is one of two diameters: 1.75mm or 2.85mm.
Diameters are not interchangeable, so be sure to research
what your printer uses.
• The extruder is the name for the assembly that grabs the fil-
ament, and pushes it through a heating block.
• Stepper motors drive the belts and extruder up/down, left/
right, and forward/back.
• The chassis is the frame of the 3D printer, which could be
made from metal, plywood, etc.
• The hot end is the part of the extruder that heats the fila-
ment to just the right temperature based on that material,
with a nozzle at the bottom to allow the molten filament to
flow through.
• A fan controls the temperature at which each layer cools,
making the depositing and bonding of the layers more suc-
cessful.
Take note: There are many consumer 3D printers on the market,
with a variety of features and functions. For instance, some have
print beds that do all the moving, while others rely on the
extruder assembly to do all the movement. All are valid designs
and particular choices come down to personal preference.
Understanding FDM Printers 29

Resolution Levels
Let's take a moment to talk about how 3D print quality is
defined. In the normal 2D printing realm you will see printers
that claim "600 dpi" or "1200 dpi" resolution. Those metrics
refer to "dots per inch" of ink deposited on the paper. The more
little dots of ink per inch, the higher the resolution. It's similar in
3D printing!
All 3D printers (FDM and SLA) have two different types of reso-
lutions:
• Layer Z is the height resolution (in the up/down, or Z plane)
• XY is the positional resolution (in the left-right, forward-
back, XY planes)
The Z-height resolution is the most common metric you will see
in FDM printers. As you can see in Figure 4-2, these three cubes
are all the same size, but they are 3D printed at different layer
resolutions. All of the measurements given here are in
"microns," which are fractions of a millimeter. 1,000 microns
equal 1 millimeter, so we are talking about resolutions that are
typically around 1/5th of a millimeter (or 200 microns).
Figure 4-2. A close-up image of three layer heights printed at
(left to right) 100 microns, 200 microns, and 300 microns
In the three cubes in the figure, the individual layers are more
densely packed on the left than on the middle or right. If you
want a higher-quality surface finish, then you will choose a layer
height that is smaller, which packs more layers into your end
30 Getting Started with 3D Printing

object. The lower the micron level, the less you can see the print
lines on the object.
Resolution Versus Speed
An object that prints with a layer height of 150
microns will take twice as long to print as the same
object with 300 micron layers. That is because the
printer has to print double the number of layers for
the same object. The lower the microns, the longer
to print, but the higher the print quality.
The other metric for resolution is the XY accuracy—how accu-
rate each individual layer (if viewed by itself from the top) can be
"drawn" by the printer. Because most FDM printers use a .4mm
nozzle (400 microns) they are limited to features on the edges
of each layer of around 250 microns, as shown in Figure 4-3.
This is very good resolution, but as you will see in Chapter 5,
there are much more accurate technologies available if you
need extreme detail.
Figure 4-3. XY positional accuracy between layers created using
SLA (left) and FDM (right). Notice less detail on the right image
based on thickness of plastic extruded.
FDM printers do some phenomenal work, though! Look at some
examples in Figure 4-4 to see the quality level achieved on FDM
3D printers.
Understanding FDM Printers 31

(right). With the 3D print being so detailed, the low resolution of
the original 3D model can be seen (right).
Frame/Chassis
This is what you first see when you look at a 3D printer; the
overall general shape. There have been many 3D printers that
have enjoyed crowdfunding success on websites such as
Kickstarter or Indiegogo because of beautiful 3D printer enclo-
sures/frames. If the enclosure looks nice, people are more
inclined to infer it's a quality printer. This is only somewhat true,
and this is where your own research can really help you make an
informed purchasing choice.
Don't judge a printer by it's cover. Many 3D printers have 3D
printed parts holding them together. And why not? It helps keep
costs down and allows for easier upgrades later on. While 3D
printed parts might lack the durability of machined parts, having
3D printed parts in your printer should not be a mark against
the overall printer itself. If an update to the design becomes
available, you can print your own upgrades! Keep in mind, 3D
printed parts can be found in all price ranges of printers, and
some have no 3D printed parts at all. As with all products, it is
advisable to read the forums and unbiased reviews to see if a
printer, no matter how it is assembled, is reliable.
The frame/chassis needs to be structurally sound over time. 3D
printers have moving parts. They get bumped and prodded
when you're removing prints from the build plate. If you will be
32 Getting Started with 3D Printing

moving your printer from location to location, frame strength is
something you will especially want to keep in mind and a metal
frame holds better than wood.
There are quite a few "kit" 3D printers that you have to put
together yourself that are incredibly structurally sound, such as
the Prusa i3 kit and Maker's Tool Works MendelMax 3.0. When
you are looking at FDM printers (or really any 3D printer) look
critically at the choices that the manufacturers made:
• How thick is the sheet metal forming the chassis?
• Is there flex to the horizontal arm that carries the extruder
assembly that would result in potential alignment issues?
• How rigidly is the build plate held in place? How easy is it to
loosen and adjust?
• What sort of components went into the extruder assembly?
Are they machined parts? Are they custom made, or some-
thing that is shared by many other manufacturers?
A good example of a well-made 3D printer is from a San Fran-
cisco Bay Area company named Type A Machines (TAM). TAM
started its business selling 3D printers that were assembled out
of plywood. After its initial printer gained traction, the company
wanted to appeal to both hobbyists and low-end manufacturers
so it changed the chassis to prebuilt metal. Because TAM deci-
ded to move to a 3D printing assembly that had no 3D printed
parts, the overall price rose, but the reliability and overall cus-
tomer satisfaction also rose. As we said earlier, it is not really
about the specific components that go into a 3D printer, but
how well it works, and how well it holds up over time.
In addition to an all-metal frame, these 3D printers show some
good features to look for like custom extruders and ribbon
cables (Figure 4-5), as well as silent stepper motor drivers that
regulate the electricity sent to the motors to allow for extremely
quiet printer operation (Figure 4-6).
Understanding FDM Printers 33

Figure 4-5. Custom extruder on a Type A Machines printer
Figure 4-6. Electronics bay of the Type A Machines printer with
silent stepper motor drivers highlighted
The two figures illustrate choices made by the 3D printer manu-
facturer to adapt the printer for longevity and printing in office
settings. The extruder is one of its own designs, and is rated for
higher temperatures than most of the materials you will nor-
mally find.
34 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Remember, over 90% of companies in the consumer 3D print-
ing realm are what would be considered "small businesses" with
40 or fewer employees, so the fit and finish of each product is
something that characterizes the company behind the product.
Don't be fooled by fancy renderings or pictures; there is no sub-
stitute for seeing and experiencing the build quality yourself (or
in reading independent reviews written by knowledgeable
reviewers).

The build plate (or print bed), as shown in Figure 4-7, is pretty
straightforward. It is the place where the 3D model is built, layer
by layer. Different manufacturers use different materials for the
build plate, and you will commonly see acrylic slabs as well as
glass. This is an important part of the print process, and one
that you should evaluate carefully before you purchase an FDM
printer.
Figure 4-7. Glass build plate
All FDM printers require the build plate to be level to the
extruder assembly's movement plane(s), otherwise your prints
will print lopsided or, worse, fail completely.
Many people think that the term "leveling the build plate"
means that the plate needs to be level to the ground. This is not
the case. The build plate needs to be level to the travel of the
extruder assembly for the print itself to be level. In other words,
the extruder and plate need to be perfectly parallel.
Understanding FDM Printers 35

Ease of Calibration
When evaluating 3D printers, it is important to
research how easy it is to calibrate/level the build
plate to the extruder assembly. Today, only a very
few FDM printers use automated systems to level
the build plate. For the most part, you as the end
user will have to level the build plate manually quite
often, or risk failed prints.
It is also good to understand that build plates themselves are
different. Some are heated, which allow for more materials to be
printed on them, and some are nonheated. A picture of a heated
build plate is shown in Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8. A glass print bed/plate with a red heating element
underneath. The heat bed temperature sensor (which monitors
the print bed temperature) is to the far right, under the glass.
You can print a wide variety of materials without a heated bed.
Of course, having the option to use a heated plate opens up your
material selection to more materials but usually comes at an
added cost to the base printer price.
You must prepare your build plate in order to get the 3D print to
stick to it. Running with a heated build plate sometimes miti-
gates this, but for the most part you will be using one of a few
36 Getting Started with 3D Printing

different methods to get your print to stick. Some people use
blue painter's tape, while others use a glue stick; there are many
ways to get the print to adhere to the build plate. A more com-
prehensive description of these techniques is described in "Tips
for Success with FDM Printers" on page 49.
Linear Movement Controls
All 3D printers need to use motion to print. There are two gen-
eral types of 3D printing movement systems, both achieving
good build quality but going about the process in very different
ways. The two types are called Cartesian and Delta printers.
Cartesian movement systems (Figure 4-9) were the first to
appear in the consumer realm, and their movement is based on
principles you probably learned in school. There are three axes
in a Cartesian printer—X, Y, and Z:
• X movement is to the left and right.
• Y movement is to the front and back.
• Z movement is up and down.
Figure 4-9. Visual representation of Cartesian coordinates with
X, Y, and Z axes labeled (infographic by Jeff Hansen, Honey-
Point3D™)
Understanding FDM Printers 37

These terms can change between printers, though. Some print-
ers will move the nozzle in what seems to you to be a left-right
movement, but call that plane of movement the Y plane. Suffice
to say that all Cartesian printers use the X/Y/Z coordinate sys-
tem, drawing out each layer in the XY space, and then moving
the extruder assembly by a certain number of microns in the Z
direction to start the XY print process over again.
Delta printers go about 3D printing in a different way. These
printers borrow from mechanisms that have long been used on
on assembly lines called "pick and place" machines. Instead of
an X/Y/Z linear system, they use a system based on a "floating"
extruder assembly that is pulled in a combination of directions
by three arms that are attached to linear rails and pulleys, as
shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-10. The Rostock Max v2 Delta printer from SeeMeCNC.
Picture taken looking downward from the top of the printer to the
build plate.
To understand how a Delta printer works, imagine you and two
friends holding a hockey puck with a pen in the center of the
puck. If you all coordinate your movements, you can draw pic-
tures with that hockey puck, but you all have to work together to
get the hockey puck and pen in the right place at the right time.
38 Getting Started with 3D Printing

That is how Delta printers work. If you are having a difficult time
visualizing the movement, do an Internet search for Delta print-
ers and watch some videos.
Why were Delta printers created if the Cartesian system was
developed first and worked well? Delta printers overcome two
major problems the Cartesian systems have. First, Cartesian 3D
printers are limited in Z height (the overall vertical height of the
print) to the maximum length of the large lead screw that raises
or lowers the build plate, or extruder assembly as shown in
Figure 4-11.
Figure 4-11. Photo highlighting one of two lead screws in the
Mendel Max 2.0 printer
Lead screws are expensive, and as they grow in length they
become more and more variable in how straight they are. Delta
printers don't need to worry about the height of prints because
the central extruder assembly glides up on smooth rails pulled
by pulleys. Long and smooth linear rails are widely available, so
Delta printers are almost always capable of far taller prints than
their equivalently priced Cartesian printers.
Understanding FDM Printers 39

Second, Delta-style printers often enjoy higher printing speeds
than Cartesian printers because, generally, they try to eliminate
weight from the extruder assembly as much as possible. While
Cartesian printers usually have all of the filament pushing and
heating mechanisms directly above the extruder, Delta
machines use what is called a Bowden-style extruder to drive
the filament. In a Bowden setup, the heated block and nozzle
are close to the build plate, but the apparatus that grabs and
pushes the filament is located somewhere else, off of the central
area. This allows for the movements of Delta printers to be
faster because they do not have to push all that weight around.
The drawback to Delta printers is twofold. (These might not be
drawbacks to you, so judge accordingly.) Delta printers print on
a circular build plate because of how the three arms that pull the
extruder move. Accuracy at the edges of the circular build plate
tends to drop because one or more of the arms is being pulled
to its maximum length, which introduce abnormalities in the
print dimensions. Many Delta printers avoid this issue by advis-
ing you to only print in a smaller center area of the build plate, or
by enlarging the size of the entire Delta printer, and then making
the outer areas "off limits" to actual printing. So, while offering
greatly enhanced Z height printing capabilities, Delta printers
may have a smaller X/Y print area.
The second drawback concerns the use of the Bowden extruder
itself. The filament is grabbed by a pinchwheel and pushed
through a guide tube (usually made of Teflon) from farther
away, as shown in Figure 4-12. This is fine for most filament, but
the amount of arc/curvature in the tube can cause problems
when, for example, using flexible filaments. This is because the
flex in those filaments gets increased over the long distance
from the extruder to the hot end, and the filament can press
through the heating block unevenly, causing irregular extru-
sions.
40 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Ultimaker 2 printer
Extruder
The filament feeds through an extruder (or extruder assembly).
The extruder is a collection of parts that feed the filament into a
channel, heat up the filament to its melting point, and then force
that molten material through a small-diameter nozzle onto the
build plate.
The extruder assembly is made up of several parts, as you can
see in Figure 4-13. They are described here:
• Drive gear (used for gripping the filament)
• Extruder drive motor (turns the drive gear)
• Filament channel (filament is guided through here)
• Idler bearing (pushes the filament against the drive gear)
• Heating block (melts the filament)
• Nozzle (through which the molten filament flows onto the
build plate)
• Cooling fan
Understanding FDM Printers 41

Figure 4-13. Labeled diagram of extruder components (info-
graphic by Jeff Hansen, HoneyPoint3D™)
All FDM printers have variations on this setup. Some have
extruder assemblies that are single units where all of the com-
plexity is hidden inside one replaceable unit, while other 3D
printers choose to go a more modular path to allow users to
upgrade and change out pieces as their needs change or
upgrades become available.
The following images demonstrate the different types of
extruder assemblies different manufacturers use. Figure 4-14 is
an extruder from a $3,595 machine (Type A Machines), which is
made completely out of machined metal parts. Figure 4-15 is
from a $1,500 self-assembled machine (Mendel Max 3) and fea-
tures a combination of machined and 3D printed parts, and
Figure 4-16 is from a $600 pre-assembled machine also with a
combination of machined and 3D printed parts (Printrbot Sim-
ple Metal). The following three images show slightly different
42 Getting Started with 3D Printing

approaches to performing the same task: pushing a strand of
filament through a heating block in a controlled manner.
Generally, the only thing that you would consider changing is
the size of the nozzle at the very bottom of the entire assembly.
This is where the molten material exits the assembly to be
deposited on the build plate. The width of the opening deter-
mines what sort of final characteristics your printed model will
have.

44 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Standard nozzle diameters vary, but are generally around .4mm.
These dimensions dictate the width of the standard "line" of fila-
ment that comes out from the nozzle, called the extrusion width.
Strictly speaking, the extrusion width can be set in your printer
preferences, but the nozzle size dictates a few important things:
• A finer nozzle allows for thinner walls to be created and for
surface features to be more defined (like using a smaller/
sharper pencil for fine-detail drawings).
• Physics determines the maximum amount of material that
can flow through a specific physical nozzle opening. If you
want to print large objects quickly, then you will need a
larger nozzle size.
Figure 4-17 gives an example of the size of the individual extru-
ded lines of material. A .4mm nozzle usually creates a single
extrusion line that is about .48mm wide.
Figure 4-17. Calipers show an extrusion width of .48mm extru-
ded from a .4mm nozzle
Any nozzle from .35mm to .45mm is a standard size that is both
fast enough to print large objects and small enough to print
small features.
Understanding FDM Printers 45

If you need to print objects that are more specialized (either
larger or smaller), many printers offer a way of changing out the
nozzle size to accomplish certain goals. Nozzle sizes of .25mm
are pretty slow at printing larger objects, but if you need very
thin walls for your prints, you may want to move to a smaller
nozzle size like this.
On the other hand, there are nozzle and extruder assemblies
such as the one from E3D Online called "The Volcano," which
allows for much larger extrusion widths and heights, as you can
see in Figure 4-18.
Figure 4-18. Object printed by E3D Volcano extruder, with .8mm
high layers. This part printed in half the time of normal 3D print-
ers equipped with .4mm nozzles.
The nozzle diameter that printed the object in Figure 4-18 was
1mm wide, and nozzles like that can print very large objects
much more quickly than smaller nozzle sizes ever could. If you
want the flexibility of picking and choosing what types of noz-
zles you print with, you will want to consider choosing a 3D
printer platform that is open to you switching out nozzle sizes
without too much hassle, or without voiding your printer war-
ranty.
46 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Many companies offer one warranty for the printer itself, and
another, shorter warranty on the extruder assembly because of
the faster wear and tear potential. Typically, both the nozzles
and the drive gear (the toothed gear that grabs the filament and
pushes it through) are considered "consumables" because they
experience the most wear of all 3D printer components. The
rate at which you need to replace those parts, however, could
vary between once per year to once every several years,
depending on how you use your printer and how well you main-
tain it. If you are going to be 3D printing a lot on an FDM printer,
it is a good idea to see how easy it is to swap out or clean those
replaceable components.
Filament
One of the core components of an FDM printer is the thin strand
of filament that the models are eventually made out of. As we
mentioned before, filament used for 3D printing can be seen as
similar to the "ink" used in a normal 2D printers. Without fila-
ment, an FDM printer would have nothing from which to print.
Filament comes in two standard sizes, which describe the diam-
eter of the filament: 1.75mm and 2.85mm (sometimes sold as
3mm in diameter). Your 3D printer will support only one diame-
ter of filament, and you cannot easily use a different size fila-
ment if your printer was not designed to use it. Fortunately,
there is usually no appreciable price difference between fila-
ment diameters, though 1.75mm is a more common filament
diameter size. From a technical standpoint, 1.75mm is more
common because it requires about six times less force to
extrude than the thicker strand. Thinner strands require less
bulky, expensive motors to drive the filament through the
extruder, which lessens the overall weight of the print head.
There is an ever-expanding range of different materials that can
be fed through consumer 3D printers, with the FDM printers
offering the most selection out of all printing technologies dis-
cussed in this book. The most common material is called poly-
lactic acid (PLA) and is actually a type of nonedible carbohy-
drate (sugar) derived predominantly from corn. This material
prints beautifully and is the starter material of choice for all con-
sumer 3D printers for many reasons.
Understanding FDM Printers 47

Several common filament materials are shown in Figure 4-19,
but note that some of these materials may or may not work with
your 3D printer. It is best to check with your 3D printer manu-
facturer to see which materials they support.
Figure 4-19. Chart of common FDM materials (infographic by
Jeff Hansen, HoneyPoint3D™)
There is a wide variety of filament on the market, ranging in
price from $25/kg to $70/kg. That variation in price does not
always reflect a better-quality filament. Be prepared to do some
research to inform your choice in materials. Here are some sug-
gestions of things to consider:
• Make sure your printer manufacturer has tested the filament
that it sells with the printer you purchased. These filaments
will usually be slightly more expensive, but you will know that
the manufacturer has done the testing for you.
48 Getting Started with 3D Printing

• Shop online sites that have user reviews. If others have had
good experiences with filament from a specific manufac-
turer, then chances are they will print well for you too. (But
also beware that false reviews exist.)
• Buying a spool of filament just based on a picture or the low-
est price is risky. We recommend that you purchase filament
from manufacturers that are willing to reveal their "story" to
you. A good choice is Breathe-3DP, a manufacturer that
reveals how it makes and tests its filament. Whoever you buy
from, remember that great CAD models and excellent 3D
printers can't save a print from poor-quality filament.
Tips for Success with FDM Printers
Proper storage of your filament is key. Success in 3D printing is
all about variable reduction, which means limiting the number of
things that can change from one printing to the next. Between
prints you want your filament to remain as fresh as when it was
first delivered to you.
Make sure that dust and debris do not accumulate on your fila-
ment, because it will then get drawn into your nozzle, clogging it.
Storing filament in a clean, temperature-controlled environment
is one of the best ways to protect your filament when not in use.
Many FDM materials, like PLA and nylon, are hygroscopic mate-
rials, which means they absorb moisture from the ambient air. If
you live in a humid area, this could be even more of an issue for
you. For all the reasons mentioned, it is best to store filament
you are not using in an airtight container like the one shown in
Figure 4-20.
Understanding FDM Printers 49

Figure 4-20. Spools of filament stored in a mostly airtight con-
tainer, with desiccant pouches added
The desiccant canister you see in Figure 4-21 is inexpensive, can
be purchased online, and can be "recharged" if it absorbs too
much water by drying it in a kitchen oven for a few hours. This
type of desiccant is ideal for filament preservation.

Build Plate Adhesion
In the 3D printing world, there are many instances where users
have found some new and innovative way to make something
work, and then that practice spreads to others in the commu-
nity. Experiencing and finding innovative ways to get 3D prints
to stick to the print bed is one such area. Following are some
techniques that people have discovered to successfully enhance
build plate adhesion:
Blue painter's tape
Applying this tape to the top of the print bed, as shown in
Figure 4-22, has been shown to be a good way to get prints
to stick. This tape is easily removable, so sometimes the
tape can peel up while printing. Unfortunately, it can take
your model with it so make sure the edges of the tape are
rubbed down well to prevent peeling. If you are lucky, it will
not rip off when you remove your print, allowing you to re-
use that tape for the next few prints. Blue painter's tape
really only works well for PLA prints.
Figure 4-22. Blue painter's tape applied to the print bed in even,
parallel lines
White glue stick
This is our favorite method to use, as shown in Figure 4-23.
This choice is much less expensive than even blue painter's
tape. The downside is that it requires you to wash your print
bed with a wet paper towel every few prints to remove
excess glue buildup. And if your build plate is non-
Understanding FDM Printers 51

removable, then you need to be more careful, because you
run the risk of dripping water on sensitive electronic compo-
nents that are underneath. This type of glue is water-soluble,
so if you live in a humid climate, or where it rains a lot, it will
not perform as well.
Figure 4-23. Consumer glue stick used to adhere prints to the
build plate
Kapton tape
This is a transparent, orange, special type of high-
temperature tape that was originally designed for use in
NASA space missions. It can handle the high temperatures
of heated print beds, and is tacky enough for some materials
to stick directly to it. Kapton tape is primarily used in con-
junction with a heated build plate to allow materials like ABS
(and to a lesser extent PLA) to increase print adhesion to the
build plate. A thin roll of Kapton tape is shown in Figure 4-24,
with many different sizes available to purchase.
52 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 4-24. Kapton tape
Specialized 3D printing build surfaces
These are sold as third-party add-ons that help adhere
prints to the build plate, as shown in Figure 4-25. Typically,
these surfaces claim that no other adhesive or maintenance
is needed other than infrequent cleanings. We have found
that they work, but care should be taken to make sure you
have proper nozzle alignment to the print bed. Otherwise,
you run the risk of the heated nozzle melting one or more
grooves into the print surface, necessitating a replacement
surface to be ordered.

Understanding FDM Printers 53

Slicer Programs
The slicer is a type of software that translates the 3D model's
geometries into movements the 3D printer can read and per-
form. It provides various settings like print temperature and
speed. The slicer also generates support structures that are
designed to keep overhanging parts of your model from droop-
ing. (You'll find a more comprehensive discussion on support
structures in Chapter 7.) Most 3D printer manufacturers will
suggest a slicer to use, and we recommend that you start with
that one. In the instructions, you will find profiles provided for
your printer and for the filament that comes from the manufac-
turer.
Not All Slicers Are Created Equal
As with anything, some slicers are better than others. You may
"slice" one model with specific settings in one slicer and then
use another slicer with the same settings and get very different
end-print qualities.
Following is a list of quality slicers:
• Cura: free
• Slic3r: free
• Repetier Host: free
• KISSlicer: free and paid
• Simplify3D: paid only
• Autodesk Print Studio: free
Unless your printer manufacturer has a proprietary slicer, you
have a range of slicers to choose from. If you are willing to spend
around $150, a particular favorite of ours is Simplify3D, which
slices excellently and is used by hobbyists and professional
printers who prefer lots of control over the print process.
Figure 4-26 shows tool path (layer pattern) visualizations from
Simplify3D and Cura comparing how each would print the same
object.
54 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 4-26. Comparison of tool paths between Simplify3D (top)
and Cura (bottom)
Any of the free slicers will work well for most 3D printers as long
as the 3D model you are slicing is a "good" one without errors.
While all of them can do some 3D model healing and fixing, you
really want to make sure your model is good from the start. (In
Chapter 10 we'll discuss how Autodesk's Meshmixer can be
used as a tool to help you evaluate 3D models for errors.)
Understanding FDM Printers 55

Homing and Leveling the Build
Plate
One of the most important factors in encouraging your print to
print successfully is making sure that the first layer goes down
evenly and "sticks" to the build plate properly. Few FDM printers
have automatic bed leveling, so this task will typically be man-
ual.
One of the more popular printers at the time of this writing, the
Printrbot Simple Metal, offers what it calls "automatic" bed cali-
bration. There is a sensor next to the nozzle that does not set
the height of the print bed, but rather reads the angle of the bed
and adjusts the print process to compensate for a possibly
angled build plate. This prevents one (or more) sides of your
print from being shorter than the others. See a picture of the
nozzle and sensor from the Printrbot Simple Metal printer in
Figure 4-27.
Figure 4-27. Printrbot Simple Metal with bed sensor highlighted
Even for this printer, you still have to set the center height of the
build plate manually, but the bed itself could be a little off at the
edges, and the print will still come out fine.
For other printers you need to do this entire process manually.
This involves two steps:
56 Getting Started with 3D Printing

1. Leveling the bed so that all corners create a flat surface in
respect to the movement of the left-right (X) and front-back
(Y) axes.
2. Adjusting the height of the bed so that the first layer lays
down perfectly...not too far away from or too close to the
build plate.
Both of the following examples are from the Type A Machines
Series 1 printer. Figure 4-28 shows the four screws on each cor-
ner underneath the build plate that need to be adjusted to make
the build plate level with respect to the movement of the nozzle
on the XY axes.
Figure 4-28. A view from underneath the Type A Machines Ser-
ies 1 printer, showing the four bed-leveling screws with 3D
printed handles
Once the build plate is level, it (typically) should be about 100
microns, or .1 (one tenth) of a millimeter away from the nozzle,
where the nozzle reads it as its "zero" point. A great way to test
this is to "home" your nozzle to where it thinks "zero" is, and
then try to slip a sheet of paper between the nozzle and print
bed. If you can barely slide a normal piece of paper underneath
the nozzle, then it's homed. If the nozzle is too close to the plate,
the paper will drag significantly under the nozzle or bunch and
not pass underneath at all. If the nozzle is too far away the paper
will glide underneath with minimal blockage and you will need to
Understanding FDM Printers 57

make adjustments. See Figure 4-29 for a good "distance" to
home your up-down (Z) axis to.
Figure 4-29. Images showing a piece of paper being slid
between the nozzle and build plate with the nozzle being too far
away (left) and too close (right)
Follow Manufacturer Instructions
Our instructions apply to many printers, but yours
might be the exception. Always follow your specific
printer manufacturer's instructions on how to level
the bed and to set the Z height at which you should
be printing.
You've now seen how FDM printers work. Driven by the desire
for an even better surface finish—one that approaches the qual-
ity of injection-molded parts—some users opt for a different
kind of 3D printer. We'll examine resin printers and the technol-
ogy behind them in the next chapter.
58 Getting Started with 3D Printing

5/Understanding
SLA Printers
The previous chapter discussed FDM printers, which represent
about 90% of the consumer market. The other 10% belongs to
a special class of printers called SLA printers. SLA is an acro-
nym for "stereolithographic apparatus," which basically means
"gizmo that writes with light." These 3D printers create very
detailed prints, but are more difficult to use, so it is important to
know their benefits and drawbacks before you buy your first liter
of resin.
How It Works
These 3D printers do not use filament; instead, they use a liquid
resin (polymer) that hardens or "cures" when exposed to ultra-
violet light. The 3D prints from resin printers are still made layer
by layer, but are created in a slightly different way.
The basic printing process for an SLA printer is:
1. A vat of liquid resin sits in the 3D printer.
2. A build plate gets submerged to the bottom of the vat, facing
downward, until there is a very small layer of resin between
the bottom of the vat and the build plate.
3. A controlled light, pointing upward from the bottom of the
3D printer, hits the build plate in a specific pattern, harden-
ing the resin in that specific pattern.
4. The build plate then moves slightly upward.
59

5. The light shines again in a slightly different pattern from the
previous layer, and then cures to the layer that was created
before it.
6. The process repeats until the object is complete.
For a graphical representation of the process, see Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1. The SLA printing process (infographic by Jeff Han-
sen, HoneyPoint3D™)
The goal of this chapter is to show the differences between FDM
and SLA printers, as well as point out some unique considera-
tions when running an SLA printer. Here are some notable dif-
ferences between running an SLA printer versus an FDM printer:
• The resin must be kept at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit in
order for the viscosity of the resin to not be affected.
• The resin is smelly...a kind of sweet, but strong chemical
smell that may bother some people.
60 Getting Started with 3D Printing

• The printer must be kept away from windows because any
extra sunlight might cure some of the resin inadvertently.
• You must wear gloves when handling the resin and the new
3D print, as well as for cleaning up the printer to avoid get-
ting resin on your hands. This means, essentially, wearing
gloves every time you physically interact with the printer.
• Kids and pets should be kept away from the 3D printer and
resin. The resin should be considered as dangerous as
household bleach.
• After the print is finished, it will need to be rinsed by hand in
isopropyl alcohol.
• Once the print is washed off, it is a good idea to place the
print in direct sunlight or in a UV curing box for 10 minutes to
finish curing the outer layers.
• Once you are done printing, you will need to remove tiny
cured particles of resin that may have appeared and could
interfere with future prints. You should pour the leftover
resin through a commonly available paint filter or into
another container and label that container "used resin" (not
mixing it back in with the unused resin). Resin keeps for a
long time, but it is good to use up the resin that has already
been exposed to light before using brand new resin.
• Unless you plan on storing the resin in the vat (which may
get dust in it or spill if knocked over), you should wipe the
resin vat clean with a small nonabrasive wiping tool.
• You will need to replace the vat over time. The vat that holds
the resin is considered a consumable, with a typical life span
of about 3-4 liters of resin. Vats range in price but average
around $50-$80 each.
As you can see, there are a lot of considerations you need to
take into account with a resin printer. If you are willing to put up
with the process, however, you can enjoy truly exceptional
prints, as shown in Figure 5-2 and Figure 5-3.

Cost of Materials
Resin is also relatively more expensive than FDM filaments,
though they are slowly coming down in price. You can expect to
pay widely variable rates for resin. The least expensive resin can
go for $50 per liter (1000 mL) and the most expensive general-
purpose resin can go for $150 per liter.
As a rough statement, the price of 3D printing with a $50 resin
is about on par with printing in PLA on an FDM printer when
measured per cubic centimeter. The more expensive resins are
similar to printing with specialty FDM filaments (like PET).
If you are considering only the cost of resin, those prices can
seem a bit high. But if you think about your new-found ability to
print detailed objects at home and on demand, changing those
designs as often as you want, and then being able to success-
fully cast them, you should consider the price of this process as
it existed before 3D printing. A full description of the costs asso-
ciated with 3D printing in resin at home can be found in Chap-
ter 12.
An Open Source Resin Printer
In 2015, Autodesk launched its resin printer called
Ember. In the months that followed, Autodesk open-
sourced every aspect of this printer, including the
formula for the resin. This allowed people to make
their own resin and resin printers, creating a drop in
price. Most people will not become overnight chem-
ists and start mixing their own UV resin, but if you
want to do so, you can read about the formulation
here.
Types of Resins
Because of the way resin is formulated, there is less choice in
material properties for the SLA printers than what you will find
in FDM printers. The most common types of resins fall into
these four categories:
Understanding SLA Printers 63

• Normal/general-use
• Hard/durable
• Flexible
• Castable
How Castable Resins Are Used
Most castable resins need to go through a burn-out
process. The resin print is placed in an investment-
casting material (plaster) that is hardened, and then
the mold is placed in a kiln to burn out the resin
inside. This leaves a hollow cavity, and the molten
metal used for casting is then poured into that.
Castable resins are predominantly used in jewelry
design and production.
There are almost always trade-offs and benefits when moving
from one type of resin to another. For example, resins that are
made for strength and durability cannot print in fine details like
normal, general-use resins. But, those more durable resins can
take more physical stress than the general-use resins
Some 3D printer manufacturers also manufacture their own
resin, and they (usually) strongly suggest that only their specific
brand of resin is to be used in their printers. Here is a list of pop-
ular resin vendors with their website addresses.
• Formlabs Resin
• MadeSolid Resin
• B9 Resins
• MakerJuice Resin
• Autodesk Resin
• Spot-A Materials

Third-Party Resins
While most SLA printer manufacturers allow the use
of third-party resin, other manufacturers state in
their terms and conditions that the printer warranty
will be void if third-party resin is used. We recom-
mend you read the terms and conditions of any
printer you want to buy thoroughly to make sure you
can use third-party resins.
The Two Types of SLA Printers:
Laser and DLP
Laser-based SLA printers trace out the curing path of the resin
with a laser, while digital light processing (DLP) printers use a
light projector to cure one entire layer at a time. The following
chart explains the strengths and drawbacks of each type of
printer.
LASER SLA Printer
DLP SLA Printer
Very fast for small objects
because the laser only has to
trace a small area before
moving the build plate up.
Similar speed for all 3D prints,
regardless of object size, since the
entire layer is either cured or not
cured all at once.
Slower for large objects
because the laser has to trace
large areas.
Much faster, comparatively, for
large objects because the entire
layer is cured all at once.
Universally come with
proprietary software for
printing because it is difficult
to control the laser accurately
with third-party software.
Comes either with proprietary
software or a limited selection of
free/open source software,
depending on manufacturer.

Example: Kudo3D Titan 1 printer,
and Autodesk Ember.
Understanding SLA Printers 65

As a general statement, resin printers, per volume of printable
area, are more expensive than FDM printers. While some good
FDM printers can be bought for $500, resin printers only really
start to come to the market as solid machines at around $1,600
and go up to around $3,500. (Prices may change over time.)
Printer Profile: Autodesk Ember
(DLP Technology)
In 2015, Autodesk released the Ember resin printer at a cost of
around $7,500 USD (for a complete kit with extra resin vats,
cleaning supplies, and starter liters of resin). Ember, as shown in
Figure 5-4, is a custom-designed DLP printer that has a very
small build envelope of just 64mm x 40mm x 134mm. This small
build envelope is perfect for small items like jewelry prototypes
and biomedical applications.
Figure 5-4. The Autodesk Ember DLP printer
Though this printer has a smaller build envelope, bear in mind
that traditional professional-level 3D printers catering to jewelry
artists can cost around $50,000. With a $7,500 price tag (at the
time this was written), this printer offers an attractive alterna-
tive to the previous options, providing the very fine level of detail
seen in Figure 5-5.
66 Getting Started with 3D Printing

detailed hair-like structures (image by Scott Grunewald, 3dprin-
tingindustry.com)
What is truly unique about the Ember printer is that every com-
ponent of the printer has been made open to the public. You can
visit the Autodesk website to download every schematic of the
hardware, the electronics, the software, and the resin to build on
your own, all of which is offered under a nonrestrictive license.
The full CAD design files for the Ember printer have been
released in Fusion 360, which we will introduce you to in Chap-
ter 11. You are free to build your own Ember printer using those
designs (Figure 5-6) if you wish.
Compared to the 150+ FDM printers currently on the market,
there are fewer SLA printers to choose from. Resin printing in
the consumer realm is less developed partly because SLA tech-
nologies exited patent protection much later than FDM printers
and partly because the printers are more difficult to run and
cost more to buy. The availability of resin printers is quickly ris-
ing, though, and represents one of the highest growth areas of
consumer printers. Again, the level of detail produced in these
printers is unparalleled in the consumer FDM printer world.
Understanding SLA Printers 67

Printer Profile: Kudo3D Titan 1
(DLP Technology)
Many 3D printers enjoy success on the crowdfunding website
Kickstarter. The Kudo3D Titan 1 resin 3D printer was one such
example. Its campaign raised nearly $700K USD to fund the
printer's development. The printer had an end price to consum-
ers of around $3,200 USD.
68 Getting Started with 3D Printing

The Titan 1 (Figure 5-7) is a good example of a DLP-based
printer that allows for use of third-party resin.
Figure 5-7. Kudo3D Titan 1 3D printer
If you look inside the Kudo3D Titan 1 printer, you will see that an
upward-facing projector shines its light through a transparent
vat onto a build plate, as shown in Figure 5-8.

Understanding SLA Printers 69

This printer differs from resin printers like the FormLabs and
Ember printers by being more "open" with the software that can
be used to generate prints and by using more consumer-
available parts (like a modified desktop computer chassis, as
seen in Figure 5-8). This allows for larger overall prints. Plus, any
slicing software that supports DLP printers can be used, any
third-party resin can be used, and the quality from the printer
itself is excellent, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9. Make: magazine's twisted-rook "torture" test, used
to push the capabilities of resin printers, printed here with the
Kudo3D
You will need to calibrate this type of open source printer for dif-
ferent Z-height resolutions by manually moving the projector up
or down, and then securing the projector by hand-tightening the
screws. Kudo3D claims a super-fast print speed of 2.7 inches
per hour at 100 micron resolution for any object up to 7.5" x 4.3"
by 10" tall. The fast prints and lower price point make this a
great choice for certain users.
70 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Printer Profile: FormLabs Form 2
(Laser Technology)
On the other side of the SLA spectrum is the FormLabs Form 2
printer shown in Figure 5-10. This company also started as a
successful Kickstarter and has since brought out multiple itera-
tions of its original laser printer.
Figure 5-10. FormLabs Form 2 printer
This printer is used by professionals around the world for rapid
prototyping and is an extremely reliable printer. As of this writ-
ing it is priced at around $3,500 USD. FormLabs creates its own
software for use with this printer and is able to control the print
workflow more precisely. In many professional settings, the
slightly increased cost of the FormLabs printer, and FormLabs
resin, is well received due to the consistent prints that can be
relied on for rapid prototyping and end-consumer satisfaction
with the build quality.
The laser-based system shown in Figure 5-11 is extremely accu-
rate in detail (see Figure 5-12). While it might not be as fast as
Understanding SLA Printers 71

DLP printers when printing large objects, in professional set-
tings it's excellent at creating consistent prints that require a
less manual process.

72 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Software: Slicers for Resin Printing
Because the printing process using SLA printers can be affected
by many factors, many printer manufacturers have created their
own software to manage the print process. Typically, that soft-
ware is tuned to print with a specific formulation of resin, and if
you use third-party resin, you may run into issues. This is espe-
cially true with all laser-based resin printers, because the soft-
ware understands how to move the laser in different directions
to cure the layers.
Some proprietary software will allow you to tweak settings for
exposure time or layer separation time, allowing for other resins
to be used, but some software really does not open those capa-
bilities to you. As mentioned before, check with the specific
printer manufacturer you are researching to see how well it wel-
comes experimentation from its printer owners.
Conversely, having an all-in-one software system for resin print-
ing can be a benefit. The FormLabs printers use proprietary
software called "PreForm" that functions as a slicer for their
resin printers. This software makes the preparation of models
straightforward and does a great job at creating support struc-
tures for the prints while offering convenient presets for
FormLabs resins.
Slicers for DLP printers work a little more simply than having to
create pathways for lasers to trace. As you read earlier, these
types of 3D printers shine a pattern on the build plate. Techni-
cally these patterns are just a series of black and white images.
Where the image is white, more light is hitting that area and get-
ting cured into a solid. Any place that is black will not be cured
and will remain liquid. In Figure 5-13 you see a typical set of lay-
ers that would be projected on the build plate, one at a time, to
form an object.
Understanding SLA Printers 73

Figure 5-13. A succession of layers that would be projected, one
by one, on the build plate to create a 3D object
Printers like the Kudo3D, and other "DIY" 3D printers like the
LittleRP; $600 without projector and the DropLit DLP Printer;
$400 without projector—provide a couple of options for free
software, but that wasn't always the case.
For quite some time there was only one choice for free software
to create the slices for DLP printers, Creation Workshop: it is
able to create support structures, as well as sliced images such
as those shown in Figure 5-13.
Now, there is another choice. Late in 2015, Autodesk released
its free Print Studio software, which also acts as a slicer. It sup-
ports not only DLP printers and their image-slices, but also the
tool paths required for FDM printing, all from one central appli-
cation. You can find it here.
74 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Support Structures for SLA
Printing
Most SLA printers slowly pull an object, upside down, out of a
vat of resin. There are differences that need to be taken into
consideration for the creation of support structures using this
technology versus FDM technology. The three main differences
are:
• The model is being printed upside down, so the effects of
gravity on your model's overhangs (compared to FDM) will
be reversed.
• SLA printers can print much more accurately than FDM
printers, and so the support structures tend to be much
more delicate and thin.
• All SLA prints experience adhesion between the newly cured
layer touching the bottom of the vat and the build plate, or
previously printed layers. In between actual printing, the
printer will "rip" the print off of the bottom of the vat by mov-
ings upward, and then move downward again for the next
layer to be cured. All resin prints have a platform that is
printed first to prevent those strong forces from being
applied to your model. Figure 5-14 shows the difference
between SLA and PLA support structures, including the first
layer of supports seen in SLA prints.
Conclusion
SLA printers require more discipline in order to get to a final
print, but for many the process is worth it. Certainly, for those
printing with castable resins in the jewelry industry, the benefits
of a resin printer cannot be overstated. Due to the level of detail,
SLA prints are immediately more acceptable as finished prod-
ucts for most customers.
You've now learned about FDM and SLA printers. Maybe you are
thinking you're not quite ready to take on the challenges of
operating and maintaining your own quite yet. The next chapter
discusses the pros and cons of owning a 3D printer versus out-
sourcing the actual 3D printing to a service.

6/Outsourcing Versus
Buying Your Own 3D
Printer
Many people have compared the current state of 3D printing to
where personal computers were in the 1980s. Back then, PCs
were bigger and clunkier, and the processes were not as stream-
lined. Hobbyists, who didn't mind fixing the process as they
went, were the first to adopt the new technologies. The primary
owners of 3D printers today are also DIYers. But that will
change. As with personal computers, in time 3D printers will
become more of an everyday commodity.
Let's compare the different technologies and options as they
are now. We will look at home printing versus outsourced print-
ing and make distinctions between FDM and SLA, as well as
consumer versus professional outsourcing (Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1. The advantages and disadvantages of home versus
outsourced 3D printing (infographic by Jeff Hansen, Honey-
Point3D™)
77

The Benefits of Outsourcing Your
Printing
For many, 3D printing will never happen at home. After all, it is
very easy to submit a 3D model online, and have your object
arrive on your doorstep 7-10 days later. That object will be
printed on a 3D printer that may cost anywhere from $60,000
to $1,000,000.
The graph in Figure 6-1 shows that outsourcing your 3D printing
jobs saves you time. You don't have to set up the printer and
monitor the print as it's being produced. You also get the benefit
of having more material choices. Speed of delivery is less attrac-
tive because you have to wait for your print to be mailed to you,
and the cost is higher because you are paying for material and
someone's else's time.
But the highest benefit of outsourcing is that it allows consum-
ers to create objects of the highest levels of quality on some of
the most expensive machines in the market. The quality of
those prints can be near "production quality," making this not
only an attractive approach but necessary for some applica-
tions.
Many businesses could benefit from custom-created 3D printed
products. Promotional giveaways, rapid prototypes of a new
product, creation of visual props for sales calls, and many other
examples show the value of 3D printing. But not all these com-
panies have in-house CAD designers and 3D printers. They want
to participate in the benefits of 3D printing but can't allocate the
financial and time resources to bringing on staff for it. That's
where outsourcing really has its benefits.
Luckily, there are many options for outsourcing, and it offers an
alternative to otherwise costly productions that would be out of
the question for many consumers and businesses.
Popular Outsourced 3D Printing
Service Bureaus
Consumer-focused 3D printing services like Shapeways, shown
in Figure 6-2, and Sculpteo, shown in Figure 6-3, offer lower
78 Getting Started with 3D Printing

costs than the more professional alternatives, and they also
offer a wide range of materials and a more accessible ordering
process. Businesses are using these companies, too, to make
rapid prototypes and small production runs.
Figure 6-2. Shapeways home page

If you need specialized techniques or absolute precision in your
final model, then moving to a more business-oriented out-
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 79

sourced 3D printing service bureau might be a good option.
Proto Labs, shown in Figure 6-4, does not have a repository of
designs you can purchase like Shapeways and Sculpteo, but it is
focused on more high-end fabrication technologies for custom-
ers with specific mechanical and physical properties require-
ments.
Figure 6-4. Proto Labs home page
Proto Labs excels in high-quality steel and alloy 3D printing,
CNC machining parts for functional testing, and injection mold-
ing for low-volume production runs. If you were a large design
firm that wanted to get functional prototypes of new kitchen
faucets that needed to screw into existing receptacles, Proto
Labs would be the kind of service you would look to. In fact,
services like Proto Labs are commissioned to 3D print parts for
advanced aerospace designs that will be tested in flight, with
large, expensive machines depending on those parts to be
strong and stable.
Services like Proto Labs may not be in the public's eye, but they
are behind the scenes pushing the medical field into new areas,
for example by creating new implants for hip replacement sur-
geries. They are typically more involved with the high-profile 3D
printing stories you might have heard about on the news.
80 Getting Started with 3D Printing

The Rise of Local Outsourcing
Until this point, we have mentioned only large international print
service bureaus. Just as with any consumer product, you don't
know where your object is being printed, or by whom—you just
receive it in the mail. If you want to know who is making your 3D
printed object, there is a service called 3D Hubs that delivers
locally made prints. Figure 6-5 shows 3D Hubs' home page. Its
website is filled with useful information like local events you can
attend, industry stats on materials usage, and even a place for
you to list your 3D printer as a service!
Figure 6-5. The home page for 3D Hubs showing (at the time of
this writing) 25,189 printers ready to make your object locally
People from around the world have listed their 3D printers on
the 3D Hubs platform. Each printer provider, usually just a
one-person operation, offers prices and material options. The
prices and setup fees vary from "hub" to "hub" so do your
research and review their individual ratings before making a pur-
chase.
3D Hubs works similarly to the other outsourcing service
bureaus, but with some notable differences:
• You are supporting your local economy by purchasing from
3D printers in your area.
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 81

• Most printers on this service are consumer 3D printers (cost
under $5,000) so you might be limited in material choices
and quality.
• You can pick up your print in a day or two at the "hub"
(someone's house), or the "operator" (owner) of the "hub"
can ship the print to you.
• You get access to slightly less expensive materials like PLA
as well as ones that are more exotic/experimental like hybrid
carbon fiber materials, flexible materials, and even, in some
areas, chocolate!
• The "hub" or person you order from "lives and survives" on
feedback and customer ratings, so they are really motivated
to give you good service.
• You get to connect with people in your local area who are
knowledgeable about 3D printing and who may have other
resources they can refer you to.
Similar to the international service bureaus, 3D Hubs also
quotes you an instant price. This might include a flat "setup" fee
and the charge to make the print based on the cubic centimeter
volume of the 3D model.
After you order, you will receive an email or phone call within a
day or so to confirm your order and the printing process starts.
Remember that the hub "operators" on this service are local
people who own a 3D printer and probably have other day jobs.
Because their printer, the filament they use, and their work
practices are not regulated by 3D Hubs, we recommend you
read the reviews and go with a "hub" that matches your level of
expectation. Our experience so far has been good with printers
on this service, and the 3D Hubs website is easy to navigate.
If you don't mind searching for a good, self-found printing part-
ner at a cheaper cost, then try 3D Hubs. If you are looking for
assurances of material quality, or are working under strict busi-
ness processes and protecting sensitive designs to comply with
your own company's internal processes, then purchasing from
the international service bureaus may be a better choice for
you.
82 Getting Started with 3D Printing

The Benefits of 3D Printing at
Home
Certainly many of the 3D prints you see on the Internet today
were produced in people's garages and homes. 3D printing at
home offers the hobbyists and makers faster feedback on their
3D model, as shown in Figure 6-6. They can print each version
at home, not having to wait days to receive the print as is the
case with service bureaus.
Figure 6-6. 3D printing at home gives hobbyists quicker feed-
back on a 3D model
Where 3D printing at home costs around four cents per cubic
centimeter, it is not uncommon to see a price of 50 cents to $1
per cubic centimeter from an online service bureau (plus a
setup fee added on top of that). That represents a 10x increase
in price over printing it yourself, not counting your own time for
setting up, monitoring the print, and cleaning up.
A disadvantage for 3D printing at home is one that is also diffi-
cult to quantify. It's the amount of time that it takes you to do
everything that "surrounds" the actual 3D printing. This
includes leveling the build plate, making sure your filament is
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 83

stored properly, and other factors that take time and some
knowledge in order to do successfully. For the most part, once
you have gone through your initial learning process for 3D print-
ing at home, the process becomes easier. The analogy is like
going to a restaurant versus making the food at home from
scratch!
But as we mentioned in the beginning of the book, the act and
process of 3D printing at home and being a DIY hobbyist is very
rewarding. Remember the last time you learned a new skill—
woodworking or making ceramics, for instance—and then mas-
tered it enough to get the results you wanted? 3D printing at
home provides you with similar opportunities to expand your
knowledge and the satisfaction of honing your skills.
Variables Involved When 3D
Printing at Home
There are things to consider if you want to print at home. Let's
run down the list of the differences between printing at home
with an FDM printer and printing at home with an SLA printer
(Figure 6-7).
Figure 6-7. Advantages and disadvantages for FDM printers
compared to SLA printers for printing at home. The chart
includes the general prices for printers in the consumer realm
(infographic by Jeff Hansen, HoneyPoint3D™).
84 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Price
On average, FDM printers will cost less than SLA (resin)
printers. At the time of this writing, a good FDM printer can
cost $600 and up, while a good SLA printer averages
$2,000. There are some SLA printers that cost only a few
hundred dollars, but they require you to provide your own
projector.
Size
Some SLA printers that are DLP-based (and not laser-
based) will have resolution that slightly decreases when you
go to print larger objects. Mainstream FDM printers can
print up to 12" x 12" x 12" while many resin printers print
comfortably at only a smaller 6" x 6" x 6" size.
Quality
What the SLA printers lack in volume of print area, they
more than make up for in the quality of the resulting print.
SLA/resin prints from consumer printers are such good
quality that they can look injection molded. FDM printers, on
the other hand, produce visible layers.
Speed
FDM printers are limited to an upper limit of about 100-
150mm/second print speed, having to trace out each line in
each layer individually with molten material. Laser-based
resin printers work the same way, but they trace with a laser
beam and are typically much faster when completing a layer.
But one of the drawbacks of resin printing is that the model
needs to be separated from the bottom of the resin vat; this
process requires force to break away the cured layer of resin
and then move the build plate back down for another curing
operation to get the next layer. This puts laser-based sys-
tems roughly on par with FDM printers.
DLP resin printers (which cure with light) cure an entire
layer, small or large, at one time. For larger prints, or prints
that have a lot of one thing copied over and over (such as
jewelry designs), DLP printers can be faster than laser SLA
or FDM printers.
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 85

Material availability
FDM printers offer the most diversity with more than 50
materials (and growing) to choose from. 3D printing service
bureaus come in second place with the most variety
because they own many different types of printers. Some of
these services are even willing to 3D print parts in a castable
material and then traditionally cast them using materials
such as brass, bronze, or steel.
Materials cost per unit
When you create a model, the space inside of the model can
be described using a metric of volume, which is typically
"cubic centimeters." Online 3D printing service bureaus will
give you prices for materials that are charged at a starting
flat rate, and then the number of cubic centimeters is multi-
plied by the price per cubic centimeter.
If you are printing at home, you have no startup fee and your
material cost will be much less. A single spool of PLA fila-
ment, 1kg (2.2lb), will represent about 800 cubic centime-
ters of printable material and costs range around $21 to $35.
More exotic filaments like PET or flexible filament are
roughly double the price of PLA filament, thus in the $70
range.
Resin printing at home costs over 200% more than FDM
printing at home based on the three general price points
currently offered by resin retailers of $55, or $100, or $150
per liter of resin. Using the same formula for resin's specific
density, one liter of resin contains about 900 cubic centime-
ters of printable material.
Time needed for setup/cleanup
This is the other critical factor that sways people in one
direction or the other. With the online print services, the
base startup fee for an FDM print can be around $5. For
resin prints, startup fees can be around $20. Why the differ-
ence? Resin is much harder to work with than FDM. When
you run a resin printer, you have to use gloves to prevent the
resin from getting on your hands, as well as pour the unused
resin back into containers for long-term storage. A resin
print also needs to be washed off with isopropyl alcohol to
86 Getting Started with 3D Printing

remove the uncured resin, and it needs some time in an
ultraviolet curing box (or to be placed in direct sunshine) to
finish curing.
For an FDM print, you just pop the print off of the build plate
and everything is pretty much done. Of course, if your work-
flow requires extreme detail, or you do not mind working
with resin, you will enjoy the prints that resin printers create.
Production Quantity: Low-Volume
Manufacturing
If you are looking to create many units of a design, you have
three options: 3D print them at home, go through a service
bureau, or use traditional manufacturing. Typically, creating a
mold for injection molding (traditional manufacturing) costs
anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000 for a simple mold, and then
the prices rise for molds that are more complex or that are
made for producing many thousands of items. Before the capa-
bilities of 3D printing, there was a gap in the market where
inventors and product designers had very few inexpensive
options if they wanted to produce a thousand or less copies of
an item. The economics for traditional manufacturing (with
molds) only made financial sense when production neared the
"several thousands" unit range.
Figure 6-8. Type A Machines' "Print Pod" offers six printers in a
rack with central management for low-volume manufacturing
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 87

Type A Machines not only manufactures 3D printers but also
offers production capabilities for runs of 1,000 units or less with
the creation of its "Print Pods," as shown in Figure 6-8.
For Beginners, Choose FDM First
For first-time buyers, we recommend starting with FDM over
SLA. A good 3D printer in the $400 range is exemplified in the
Printrbot Play shown in Figure 6-9. It has a smaller build volume
with a 4" x 4" x 5" build envelope (101mm x 101mm x 127mm),
but the construction is solid and the price is good.
Figure 6-9. The Printrbot Play from Printrbot.com
Printrbot is one of the largest consumer 3D printer manufactur-
ers and has made a name for itself by creating durable, quality
printers that come pre-assembled at the factory and feature a
durable, all-metal chassis.
You can use open source software to create the 3D designs as
well as to control the slicing process itself, and the Play has an
auto-leveling probe that greatly simplifies the process for build-
plate leveling. The Printrbot warranty is 90 days from purchase
date for all components. What you learn on this printer will also
be applicable to other, more expensive FDM printers, so it's a
good choice for beginners.
88 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Choosing the Right Quality Finish
for Prints
If you want to sell products to consumers and the quality of sur-
face finish is important, then you have a couple of choices. You
can outsource your printing to one of the local or international
3D printing service bureaus to get excellent quality at a higher
cost per unit. Or, you can print the objects yourself.
The first option is to use an FDM printer. If you remember from
previous chapters, FDM prints show individual layers, and the
end consumer's perception of your design may suffer because
those layers do not equate to "regular quality." In this instance
you would have a couple of options.
One option is to print with a specific material (filament) called
ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). As previously discussed,
ABS is a durable material but can be a bit smelly to print with; it
also requires a heated print bed. ABS has one unique capability,
however. The chemical acetone "liquifies" ABS. You can use ace-
tone vapors to "melt" the outside layers of your print, as shown
in Figure 6-10, to create a smooth finish.
Figure 6-10. Before and after results of treating the outside of an
ABS print with a few seconds of acetone vapor
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 89

Acetone: Proceed with Caution
Acetone is an aggressive chemical that is not recom-
mended for inhaling or direct skin contact. The ace-
tone vapor you will be producing by heating the ace-
tone is extremely flammable. Exercise caution,
otherwise explosions or fires may occur.
The other method for making production parts out of FDM
prints is to do post-print hand-processing to them. This could
include sanding the prints to remove the obvious layers created
by the printing process, as well as painting the model to cover
up the remaining layers. It is a laborious process, but one that
can yield nice parts, at the expense of your time.
Evaluating for Special Mechanical
Considerations
Even if your product does not need to undergo extremes in
terms of durability or performance under stress, something as
small as a pair of earrings still undergoes the forces that are
common in life. Objects get dropped, or brush up against a wall,
or get tossed in buckets with other items. You need to make
sure that your print can withstand the environment in which it
will be placed. On average, it's best to start with FDM prints,
even if those prints might not have the best surface quality as
compared to resin prints.
The main reason to prefer FDM over resin is the wide variety of
FDM materials available to the consumer, which gives you more
choice in suiting the print to its end goal.
Figure 6-11 shows an example of one of the better filament man-
ufacturers, and why FDM printers will be at an advantage over
other technologies for mechanical prototyping.
This is a spool of PLA (polylactic acid) from a company named
Breathe-3DP. This specific type of PLA has a "++" in its market-
ing name to denote that this company feels it has some benefits
over "normal" PLA. We have tried it and really seen great results.
90 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 6-11. A spool of PLA++ from Breathe-3DP
The filament in the figure is an example of a "blended PLA" that
was designed to improve on a characteristic of PLA to be rigid,
but brittle when exposed to stresses. There is a growing field of
"functional filaments" created by a number of reputable compa-
nies that can create not only decorative items, but items that
are designed from the 3D modeling stage to take advantage of
specific material properties in certain types of FDM-created
parts. Some noteworthy brands of "specialist" filament manu-
facturers are:
• NinjaFlex is flexible.
• PET is what soda bottles are made out of and is recyclable.
• PLA++ is impact-modified PLA.
• Nylon is very strong and slightly more difficult to print with.
As an example of what a functional filament is designed to do
let's take PLA. PLA is a great material to make strong, rigid
objects. But, once your object gets stressed to a failure point,
normal PLA will snap or shatter. Look at the following example
prints to see how a normal PLA part (left, in black) fails while the
"enhanced" PLA++ from Breathe-3DP (right, in blue) survives.
Each sample was bent backward and forward three times, as
shown in Figure 6-12.
Outsourcing Versus Buying Your Own 3D Printer 91

Figure 6-12. After three back-and-forth bends, normal PLA (left)
snaps, while the enhanced Breathe-3DP PLA++ (right) remains
structurally sound
The rise of enhanced/functional materials that overcome the
limitations found in current filaments will increase. We will con-
tinue to see advancements in both FDM and SLA materials,
making them more adaptable and useful in more applications.
Conclusion
You are now more familiar with the options you have when 3D
printing your models. You will need to consider your resources in
terms of money, time, and willingness to work with technology
that sometimes fails when making the decision to print at home
or outsource the job to a third party.
It's great fun to watch the printers operate, with their buzzing
and whirring, and then seeing the results of your work turn into
a physical product. Additionally, for many people, the enjoyment
of producing 3D CAD models themselves will be more popular
than the actual physical printing process. You won't want to
miss the next chapter, which walks you through the whole 3D
printing workflow from idea, to CAD model, to print!
92 Getting Started with 3D Printing

7/Overview of the 3D
Printing Workflow
The previous chapters introduced you to 3D printing terms and
various 3D printing options. This chapter will help you get your
mind around how an idea becomes a 3D print. We will explore
the processes and tools that we use in the rapid prototyping
part of our business and explain how you can apply them at
home.
You may have seen a 3D printer in action at a local technology
event or retail store, or via an online video, and decided that you
wanted to try it yourself. You signed up for an account and
downloaded some free modeling software, as shown in
Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1. A 3D modeler working with CAD software

And...a couple of hours later you were frustrated with the unco-
operative lump of digital clay on your computer screen. You still
have positive feelings about 3D printing's potential but have
experienced the disappointment of not being able to get the
idea "from your mind to a design" on the computer. Don't worry.
You wouldn't be the first person to have this experience.
3D printing is entirely within your reach, but you will need to
approach it as you would any hobby or new technology and
anticipate a learning curve. First, we'll look at the whole process
(or workflow) in overview. Later, we'll look in greater detail at
how to work successfully with that 3D "modeling clay."
3D Files
Before you can print anything, you have to have a 3D model that
"tells" the printer what to print. The most common type of file
format in the field of 3D printing is STL, which stands for
"STereoLithography." Don't be tricked, though; this file format is
used by all 3D printers, regardless of type. The STL file simply
defines points in space and connects those points together to
form a series of triangles, which in total, are called a "mesh" or
"mesh object." The file is called a "shell model" and can be
thought of as a thin skin with a hollow interior.
These digital files are then sent to a software program, called a
"slicer," which cuts a digital file into many, many tiny "slices"
that instruct the 3D printer where to trace and lay down each
layer to make the 3D object. Imagine taking a loaf of bread and
slicing it into hundreds of horizontal slices. No two slices would
be exactly the same—each would be slightly different from the
ones right next to it. When they are all stacked one on top of the
other, they end up re-creating a loaf of bread. If you have ever
seen a medical MRI or CT scan, it's a similar process.
94 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Future File Format
As of this writing, the industry standard is the STL
file format. In April 2015, Microsoft and other promi-
nent 3D printing companies formed a consortium to
define an alternative file format that they claim
improves on the STL format. It's called 3MF, and
Microsoft said that it is designed to make 3D print-
ing easier and more manageable. The new format
would reduce loss of detail when exporting files for
3D printing, and it is designed to define vital infor-
mation like color and material specifications. The
3MF file format is relatively new, but it has promising
potential.
3D Models
You've seen 3D models all over the place! The latest science fic-
tion and animated movies are filled with 3D models, like this one
(Figure 7-2) from an open source film titled Cosmos Laundro-
mat, which was created in free modeling software called "Blen-
der."
Figure 7-2. A still from Cosmos Laundromat ((CC) Blender
Foundation)
Overview of the 3D Printing Workflow 95

3D models are a digital representation of an object. Many of the
3D models created for movies and games were not modeled
with the end goal of 3D printing. If you tried to download those
models, the model probably won't be "optimized" for 3D print-
ing and would need significant work in order to print. (We will
discuss this in greater detail in Chapter 10, where we go over
how to fix a 3D model in Meshmixer.)
Many of the real-world products we use in our daily lives begin
their existence as 3D models, like the bike frame modeled in a
computer-aided design (CAD) program called Fusion 360
shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3. A 3D model of a bicycle frame created in Autodesk's
Fusion 360
3D modeling programs are a great way to express yourself crea-
tively and to bring your ideas into reality, and we will help you
get started with them in the next section of this book. If you
don't want to make your own, however, other people have cre-
ated 3D models and have shared them freely online. You may
want to start by printing out some of these prebuilt models.
You'll find a more detailed description of where to find models
and how to evaluate them in Chapter 8.
96 Getting Started with 3D Printing

How Do I Get from Idea to Object?
In the rapid prototyping division of our company, Honey-
Point3D™, we tell customers that they can bring in an idea or
sketch and we can turn that into a computer-aided design
(CAD) file that will later be 3D printed. Many times, what they
bring is a drawing on a piece of paper, sometimes even on the
back of a napkin! Figure 7-4 shows the basic process of how we
turn an idea into a 3D print.
Figure 7-4. The workflow from idea to finished 3D print going
clockwise from the left: 2D drawing, CAD file generation, 3D
printed prototype, final piece
Some clients come into our office with nothing more than an
idea, but generally people have at least 2D drawings from which
we can extrapolate measurement details. This rapid-prototyping
process (described in Chapter 3) can be applied to creating any-
thing from a princess figurine to a car engine.
Overview of the 3D Printing Workflow 97

Details of the 3D Printing Workflow
Here's a step-by-step guide for how to turn the idea in your mind
into a physical object you can hold in your hand:
Idea
Come up with an idea for an object you want to 3D print.
Search
Thousands of 3D models already exist. Search on Thingi-
verse or other online repositories for open source 3D print-
ing communities to see if someone else has already
designed it for you. If they have, download the STL file and
proceed to the slicing step.
Plan
If it doesn't already exist as a 3D file, draw your idea out on a
piece of paper, with several different views. Draw your object
from the top, the side, and the front. If you can, put in
approximate measurements.
3D modeling
Now that you have a plan, it's time to 3D model it in a soft-
ware program. If you are a beginner to the CAD modeling
world, we recommend you start with Tinkercad. If you are
more experienced or want to create something more com-
plex, then use Autodesk Fusion 360. For organic shapes, use
Meshmixer. Starter tutorials for all three CAD programs are
provided in Chapters 9, 10, and 11.
Save and export
In all of the previously mentioned programs there is an
export function that will allow you to save your design in STL
format. Save that STL file and download it to your computer.
98 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Slice
Open up the slicing software recommended by your 3D
printer manufacturer and load your model. It's best practice
to use the program that your printer manufacturer recom-
mends first, and then move to other slicing programs later
on if you desire. Slicing an object creates many tiny horizon-
tal slices that go through the entire object, as shown in
Figure 7-5. These slices will later become the pattern by
which the 3D printer knows where to trace and deposit
material, for example, as with an FDM 3D printer.
Figure 7-5. Example of an object being sliced into many layers in
order to get it "print ready"
Evaluate support structure
Before you save your print file, you will use your slicer to
determine if your model needs support structures to "hold
up" overhanging parts. Support structures are needed to
support parts of your model that would droop due to gravity
during the build process if they were not supported. Support
structures are meant to be a hand-removable scaffolding
that the slicer will create for you automatically. See
Figure 7-6 for an illustration of the original model and then
the support structures added by the slicer.
Overview of the 3D Printing Workflow 99

Figure 7-6. (Top) A curved leaf on a pedestal. (Bottom) The cur-
vature of the yellow leaf with automatic supports added in the
slicer to make the overhangs printable. The supports (shown in
orange) will later be removed by hand.
Create G-Code/machine-readable file
The slicer will create a digital file of printer-readable code
that will direct the movements of the printer itself. Typically,
this is a G-Code file. It may be named something else
depending on the manufacturer of your printer, or it may be
a series of .png images if you are using a DLP-based SLA
printer.
Upload G-Code
Upload the G-Code/machine file to the 3D printer from a
direct connection on your computer, over a wired or wireless
network, or to an SD card that will get inserted into the 3D
printer.
100 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Make sure your printer is ready
As we mentioned in Chapter 4, your print bed needs to be
level to the nozzle. If your print bed is not properly calibra-
ted, your print will fail. Most printers do not automatically
calibrate themselves, so you will need to pay close attention
to the manufacturer's instructions on how to level the print-
ing bed. Manufacturer's instructions will also include how to
properly load and store the materials you will be printing
with and monitor the print while it's in operation.
Print
The big moment! Hit the print button and watch the magic
happen!
Verify
Well, to be clear, it's not really magic that is happening. Make
sure the first layer goes down evenly and well, and keep an
eye on your printer throughout the build process. No 3D
printer should be left unattended during the print process,
and most 3D printer manufacturers will say this in their
instructions.
Postprocess
After the print is complete, remove it by hand or with a small
prying tool from the build plate, and remove any support
structures by hand or with pliers. If you are using a resin
printer, you will need to wash/clean your print and post-cure
it for a few minutes in sunlight.
The workflow outlined here might seem daunting at first, but
many of the steps do not take that long and will quickly become
second nature to you. You'll feel a great deal of creativity and
satisfaction once you have mastered the processes and begun
making your own 3D prints!
You Can Outsource Any Part of the
3D Printing Workflow
Remember, though, you don't have to do it all yourself. You can
outsource any part of the 3D printing process—even the idea
stage! You can pick and choose which part of the workflow you
want to do and leave the rest to someone else.
Overview of the 3D Printing Workflow 101

In the previous chapter we outlined the difference between 3D
printing at home or outsourcing the job to a service bureau like 
Shapeways.com. If the process of 3D printing seems too much
for you, outsourcing the printing part of the workflow is very
easy and produces great results. (You might have to wait 10-14
days to receive your prints.) Figure 7-7 illustrates the difference
between a 3D print made at home using a consumer FDM 3D
printer versus using an outsourced service like Shapeways.com.

CAD model in Fusion 360. (Top right) Model colored in Mesh-
mixer. (Bottom left) Model printed at home using PLA material.
(Bottom right) The color 3D printed version made by Shape-
ways.com.
So now you have learned about the steps needed to make a 3D
print. The next chapter will go into more specifics of where to
find models, what the 3D models are, and what to think about
when creating your own.
102 Getting Started with 3D Printing

8/Getting and Fixing
3D Models
In the previous chapter we looked at the procedures, or work-
flow, involved in bringing your 3D model from concept to reality.
In this chapter we'll look at ways for you to get 3D models for
printing and examine some of the issues you may need to con-
sider when doing so. In the next chapter, we'll look at how to
make your own 3D models from scratch.
Downloading a 3D Model
For most people who are getting started with 3D printing, it all
begins with downloading an existing 3D model. In fact, if you
purchase a 3D printer as a kit, very often there will be improve-
ments to the 3D printer parts that the manufacturer will ask you
to download and print. These downloads are often upgrades
that the manufacturer has developed since the kit shipped.
Such is the benefit of shipping a product that can effectively
manufacture parts for itself! The model shown in Figure 8-1 is a
fan shroud, which Printrbot asks you to print out for your printer
that otherwise comes fully assembled.
Figure 8-1. 3D model of a fan shroud provided by Printrbot as a
suggested first print
103

Thingiverse is a great place to find 3D models to download and
print out yourself. Other sites are listed elsewhere in this book.
Many of the models are free for you to download and print out
for your own personal use. You can even modify them if you
want to, using software tools we'll discuss in the next section.
3D Model Licensing and Legalities
Many of the 3D models you will find for download are provided
under what is called a "Creative Commons" license. You should
familiarize yourself with the licensing terms for any model that
you download to print. The beautiful dragon shown in Figure 8-2
is an example of a user-submitted 3D model available for down-
load from Thingiverse.
Figure 8-2. Aria the Dragon (courtesy of Louise Driggers, used
with permission)
104 Getting Started with 3D Printing

The Creative Commons license for Aria the Dragon states:
This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon
your work non-commercially, and although their new
works must also acknowledge you and be non-
commercial, they don't have to license their derivative
works on the same terms.
The Creative Commons license is very adaptable, and other
models may come with different terms. On many places on the
Web, including where you download models from online sites,
the Creative Commons icons look like those shown in
Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3. Creative Commons license with icons assigned to
Aria the Dragon
Technically, any 3D model can be converted into a file for 3D
printing. But the word "technically" is used advisedly. 3D mod-
els created for movies or video games are often protected from
copying by copyrights and trademarks. If you find a 3D model of
your favorite character or item from Disney or Blizzard or some
other entertainment company, make sure it's legal to print.
Many entertainment companies today are, in fact, providing free
models for fans to copy.
Creating 3D Models with Your
Smartphone or Digital Camera
Not everyone is willing to put in the time it takes to become
adept at the 3D modeling and rendering software that we'll
introduce in the next section. Fortunately, there is an easy way
to make 3D models with your smartphone or digital camera. 
The technique is called photogrammetry and is defined as the
Getting and Fixing 3D Models 105

science of using images to create measurements. In this case,
you simply take photos of the object you want to model and
upload them to a service that will convert them into a 3D model
for you.
The best-known and most widely used free photogrammetry
service for consumers is called 123D Catch. You can install it to
your Mac or Windows PC or load it as an app to your smart-
phone.
To get started using 123D Catch, we recommend that you go to
the website and watch the short "getting started" video. If it
looks like something you want to try, sign up for a free Autodesk
account at 123dapp.com. You'll want to find an object that you
can walk all the way around and that is low enough so that you
can take pictures of the top as well as the sides. Remember, you
are creating a three-dimensional model—so you need images of
the whole object. But don't worry about the bottom for now. Fol-
low these steps:
• Take pictures of the object from all different angles and ele-
vations, overlapping each picture by about 30 degrees.
• Make sure to raise and lower the camera as you take the pic-
tures to get underneath any overhangs and to get the very
top of your object.
• Most 123D Catch captures use around 30-60 photographs,
so feel free to snap away!
• Copy the photographs to your computer.
• Open the 123D Catch application on your computer, load
your photos, and give your project a name.
• Log in to your Autodesk account and initiate the model cre-
ation.
The 123D Catch application will email you when the 3D model
has been created. Once the processing is finished you will be
able to open the online viewer and see your 3D model. If you did
not get all of the angles of your target object, the 123D Catch
model will attempt to "fill in" missing areas. If large areas were
missed, there will be a hole in your mesh.
106 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Photogrammetry is an easy way of capturing organic shapes.
While 3D modeling programs make it easy for you to create geo-
metric shapes, the creation of realistic organic shapes often
poses a challenge. Photogrammetry helps to solve this by trans-
lating complexity in the real world into low-to-medium complex-
ity in the digital world.
If you want to 3D print something you created with photogram-
metry, you will most likely have to fix the file before it is 3D print-
able. In this case, "fixing" means finding the holes in the models
where information was not collected and "filling them in" to cre-
ate a solid model. The work that needs to be done is more of the
"cleanup" variety than anything that would require a deep
knowledge of 3D modeling. We discuss this process in greater
detail in Chapter 10.
Examples of What You Can Create
In Photogrammetry
Models created in a photogrammetry application can be used
as "starter geometry" and as a basis to build upon. Remember,
in the 3D world, size does not matter, so you can create a model
of something fairly small and make that 3D model look very
large when you mix it with other objects. You can challenge peo-
ple's assumptions about "what goes with what" in terms of size
and function. Here are some ideas to help spur your creativity:
• Use 123D Catch to create a 3D model of a large seashell, and
then 3D print that model as small earrings.
• Create a 3D model of an engaged couple and 3D print it as a
wedding cake topper.
• Give an artist 10 pounds of clay and tell them to sculpt an
object. Tell them to be as creative and detailed as they want.
The resulting 123D Catch model can then be shrunk down
and 3D printed in a smaller size to be, for example, a pend-
ant.
• Capture a 3D model of an apple tree using 123D Catch, and
then replace all of the apples with 3D models of sleeping
cats (that you also captured with 123D Catch). This would
probably be an Internet sensation!
Getting and Fixing 3D Models 107

One disadvantage of photogrammetry is the low level of detail
the process captures, as shown in Figure 8-4. Even with a good
DSLR camera the average detail level of a 3D model that comes
out of 123D Catch is about 5mm to 10mm. Essentially, the fea-
tures that are smaller than 5mm will just not show up on the
resulting model. 5mm does not seem like a lot, but if you look at
the transition area between someone's nose and their cheek
you'll see it's less than 10mm. Photogrammetry's advantage is
getting the general shape of an object easily and quickly.
Figure 8-4. A garden rock captured as a 3D model using 123D
Catch, showing detail and, in some cases, lack of detail. A poly-
gon can be as large as 1 cm.
As with any technology, there are high-end and low-end devices.
In our rapid prototyping division we use two different types of 
Artec 3D scanners to capture 3D images. They each cost
around $20,000 and the phenomenal 3D scans they capture
can be used for medical, art conservation, and other professio-
nal applications. Not everyone has access to a professional 3D
scanner, though, and for most purposes a 3D model of average
resolution obtained quickly and free of charge provides a great
advantage.
108 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Understanding 3D Model File
Formats and Units of Measure
The file formats that define a 3D model are universal and can be
opened by any number of applications. The major 3D printing
file formats in order of popularity from first to last are:
• STL (Stereolithographic file)
• OBJ (Wavefront OBJ)
• VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)
• AMF (Additive Manufacturing Format)
By a far margin, the most common format is the STL file, which
describes nothing except the 3D shape itself. It does not provide
texture, color, or volume information.
Printer Code
For the coders out there, here is an example of STL file syntax,
which can be seen by opening the STL file with a text editor:
facet normal 0.000000e+000 -0.000000e+000 -1.000000e+000
  outer loop
   vertex  -6.065448e+000 -2.594533e+000 3.400000e+001
   vertex  -5.671127e+000 -2.966195e+000 3.400000e+001
   vertex  -6.199574e+000 -2.743562e+000 3.400000e+001
  endloop
 endfacet
 facet normal 0.000000e+000 -0.000000e+000 -1.000000e+000
  outer loop
   vertex  -6.199574e+000 -2.743562e+000 3.400000e+001
   vertex  -5.671127e+000 -2.966195e+000 3.400000e+001
   vertex  -6.292432e+000 -2.921260e+000 3.400000e+001
  endloop
The STL file really just describes three sides of a triangle in a 3D
coordinate space, and then the next entry (triangle) starts off
with one common side from the previous entry (triangle), and
defines the next two sides of a new triangle as shown in
Figure 8-5. This repeats over and over again, to create a "polyg-
onal mesh" that all 3D printers know how to process. This file
Getting and Fixing 3D Models 109

format is very simple and only contains information about the
surface or "shell" of the 3D model.
The STL format also cannot contain any sort of color informa-
tion for printing in color. (We added color to the mesh in
Figure 8-5 to enhance the visibility of the triangles.) Nor does
that file format have any information about the physical size of
the object in the real world. A 3D model in an STL file will show
as "x units high," but the physical unit of measurement is not
described because size is mostly irrelevant to the modeling pro-
gram. In an STL file, something that is 33 millimeters high looks
the same as something that is 33 inches high. It is only when
you want to print the model that the unit of measurement
becomes important.

shell, of a 3D model made of many triangles (10,996 triangles to
be exact!)
110 Getting Started with 3D Printing

On a service bureau's website such as Shapeways.com, you will
be asked to define the unit of measurement as shown in
Figure 8-6.
Figure 8-6. File upload dialog from Shapeways.com prompting
user to define unit of measurement. Note the maximum file size
of 1 million polygons. The bunny had just over 10,000 polygons.
Creating 3D Models with Four-
Sided Polygons and Three-Sided
Polygons
All 3D models you print with virtually all consumer 3D printers
will need to be converted to the STL format, which is comprised
of only three-sided polygons. We use the term "polygonal mesh"
and not "triangular mesh" to describe most 3D models. A trian-
gle is technically just a three-sided polygon.
There are other programs that can use four-, five-, six-, or more-
sided polygons to create 3D models. A great example is the
open source program Blender, which has the ability to create
Getting and Fixing 3D Models 111

multiple-sided polygons called "n-gons" in 3D models. There are
benefits to using polygons with more than three sides; it gives
the ability to create more graceful transitions between polygons,
as opposed to sharp triangular points.
If your model's mesh is made from four- or more-sided poly-
gons, you will need to convert that file into an STL (three-sided
triangles) for 3D printing. This conversion from "more than
three-sided polygons" down to "three-sided polygons" changes
a model by adding in more geometry. This change usually works
fine, but can sometimes create unexpected artifacts/changes
on the new model that were not there on the starting model. For
example, look at the perfect rectangle in the CAD model shown
in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7. A CAD-modeled rectangular object. Note the perfect
rectangles on all sides (also known as "quads").
When you export that model into a polygonal mesh editing pro-
gram, in order to create an STL file from the CAD file, all of the
four-sided polygons (quads) will be converted into three-sided
polygons (triangles) as shown in Figure 8-8.

They have been converted to triangles.
Fixing a 3D Model for 3D Printing
All models are not created equal. If you look through a reposi-
tory like TurboSquid, which provides models for game develop-
ers, architects, and artists, you will find a lot of 3D models, and
many of them are free to download. Since TurboSquid does not
focus on models for 3D printing, however, many of the models
you will find there will not print well. 3D models that are destined
for use in computer animation or in computer games do not
have to be as complete as 3D models that will be 3D printed.
Even 3D models made with high-end 3D scanners and photo-
grammetry need some postprocessing to make them printable.
A common problem you will encounter when you have created a
model using 123D Catch or a 3D modeling program is whether
or not the model is "manifold." The term manifold refers to how
"watertight" the model is. Think of it this way: all 3D models
define a space that is either "outside" or "inside" the model, like
the outside or inside of a ball. If you were to fill the inside of a
manifold ball with water, no water would flow out. There would
be no holes and no place for the water to leak through.
A nonmanifold model is the opposite. Water would leak out of a
nonmanifold ball because there are holes, or—in the case of our
Getting and Fixing 3D Models 113

model—missing data in the scan. Often nonmanifold models
have large holes that are easy to see. Sometimes, though, the
3D model may look manifold but really is not. The sphere in
Figure 8-9 looks manifold to visual inspection, but the software
would find a problem.
Figure 8-9. A small cut in this model makes the model nonmani-
fold. If this were to be printed, the slicer would first have to make
decisions about how to fix the model before printing.
Using Meshmixer to Fix Your 3D
Models
Without specifically using analysis tools, no amount of visual
scrutiny, even if you zoomed all the way in, would show that
there was a small cut in this sphere. The slicer software that
would 3D print this model would have a problem. It's not a solid
object it can print if there are holes.
Luckily there is hope! Most of the online 3D printing service
bureaus offer tools to repair your 3D model for you. For the
most part, these work well, but it is always better to have a good
114 Getting Started with 3D Printing

model going into the 3D printing process. That way, you are
more likely to be happy with the end result.
Quite a few applications will help you repair models with the end
goal of 3D printing. We believe a very good choice is Meshmixer,
which we mentioned earlier and will describe in greater detail
later. The Inspector tool in Meshmixer can often fix your model
in just a few clicks, as shown in Figure 8-10.
Figure 8-10. The Inspector tool in Meshmixer showing problems
with the 3D model
Clicking any of the little bubbles coming out from the model will
usually repair that part of the mesh successfully, making the
model ready for printing. Because of this, Meshmixer is an ideal
tool to integrate into your existing workflow for 3D printing, even
if you are already comfortable using other tools.
Meshmixer occupies a unique position in the 3D printing world.
It does an excellent job of bridging the gap between the digital
world of 3D modeling and the physical world of 3D printed
objects. No other software program has such comprehensive
tools to help you get a physical object created. We'll go into
greater detail on how to get up and running with Meshmixer in
Chapter 10, and we will describe how to use Meshmixer to fix
problems with your 3D model.

PART III
CAD Tutorials


9/Getting Started
with Tinkercad
In the next three chapters we will take you step-by-step through
the basics of creating a 3D model from scratch using three CAD
modeling software programs: Tinkercad, Meshmixer, and Fusion
360. You can view them respectively as beginning, intermediate,
and advanced programs, though we have taught students as
young as nine years old to use Fusion 360.
These CAD programs have the benefit of being free (or near
free), so trying them out is a great place to start. These begin-
ning tutorials are short enough that you should be able to com-
plete each one in an hour, but you should feel free to move
through them at your own pace.
Tinkercad is an online CAD modeling platform from Autodesk
that is free for anyone to use. It's known as a quick and easy way
to create 3D models and is simple enough for beginners and
kids to pick up easily. In fact, in our educational courses, we
always start beginning students, regardless of age, on Tinker-
cad. See Figure 9-1 for an example of models created in Tinker-
cad.
The platform is entirely browser based, which allows for your
work to be instantly saved to the cloud and available on any
other computer. Tinkercad runs best in modern browsers such
as Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. Internet Explorer has been known
to work, but the experience is more fluid with the other brows-
ers mentioned. Keep in mind that slow Internet speeds can neg-
atively affect the overall experience.
119

Figure 9-1. Action figure created in Tinkercad, using "Tinker-
play" components, all 3D printable
Three-Button Mouse Recommended
All CAD programs map important activities like pan-
ning around the scene (your work area). When you
approach CAD modeling, it's best to use a three-
button mouse with a scroll wheel. You can still use a
trackpad on a laptop, but the experience is less than
optimal.
Setting Up an Account
In order to access Tinkercad you will need to have an Autodesk
account. The good news is that this program is free and the pro-
motional emails you might receive from Autodesk are minimal.
If a child under 13 years of age is signing up to use Tinkercad,
their user ID request will get routed into a COPPA (Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act) compliant subsystem inside of
Autodesk that requires an adult to verify that the child is allowed
to create an account (Figure 9-2).
120 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 9-2. Tinkercad account signup requiring parental permis-
sion for users under 13 years of age
The child's account will be in a special part of the Autodesk
infrastructure where it will comply with the COPPA require-
ments. There will be restrictions on the sending of marketing
emails as well as restrictions on sharing that child's account
information with third parties. This is a good thing for the pro-
tection of children, but keep in mind this extra step can add up
to 24 hours of waiting time for kids to join the Tinkercad com-
munity. This is especially important to remember if you are
using Tinkercad in an educational setting where parents will
need to pre-register their kids on the platform.
Before You Pick Up the Mouse
We recommend you first use pencil and paper to draw your idea
out. The basic premise for all CAD design is understanding that
shapes interact with other shapes to create new shapes. This
concept sounds easy enough, but if you are just starting to learn
CAD, the best place to start is having a solid understanding of
what you are trying to create. For most people, drawing it out on
paper is more intuitive. Don't worry if it's not to scale or if your
drawing of a house looks more like a shoebox. You will benefit
greatly by having this visual guide as a reference.
If you draw a circle on a piece of paper, and then you draw
another overlapping circle just touching the side of that one, it
looks like a figure "8." This is an example of "additive" construc-
Getting Started with Tinkercad 121

tion—adding two things together to create something new. Con-
versely, if you draw a circle and then draw a smaller circle inside
it, and "remove" the inner circle, you end up with the letter "O."
This is subtractive construction, i.e., building something new by
taking away material. Both examples are shown in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3. Line drawings showing additive and subtractive
properties
"Boolean" Defined
The important CAD term "Boolean" refers to the
addition or subtraction of shapes from other shapes
to accomplish an end goal. Tinkercad is adept at per-
forming Boolean unions (adding) and Boolean differ-
ences (subtraction), which are the core of how to
start modeling your design.
In the following tutorial, we'll use Tinkercad to model a simple
nameplate. This tutorial will go over three key procedures:
adding shapes on the "Workplane," turning shapes into "holes"
or "cutting tools," and downloading your model for 3D printing.
122 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Creating Shapes in Tinkercad
When you first start Tinkercad we highly recommend you go
through the software's free set of online tutorials. These great
lessons will walk you through Tinkercad's features at a pace you
can set for yourself. They are available at the top of your Tinker-
cad account page under the "Learn" link. You can always click
the Tinkercad logo shown in Figure 9-4 located at the top left to
return back to your main account page.
Figure 9-4. The Tinkercad logo takes you back to your home
page
Getting Started with Tinkercad 123

When you return to your home page, click the "Create new
design" button (Figure 9-5) to start a new design.
Figure 9-5. The "Create new design" button lets you begin your
new project
You are presented with a blank canvas (Figure 9-6), upon which
you will create a masterpiece! Or, as is true with most model
design, you will create something that you will call "your first
try" and then figure out how to make it better over time.
124 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 9-6. The blank canvas that is called the Workplane
Next to the Workplane you just saw, on the righthand side of the
screen there is a menu bar filled with premade shapes you can
use. These shapes will help you create your 3D model for even-
tual 3D printing.
Click the Geometric section in order to drop down the menu of
shapes, as shown in Figure 9-7. Click and hold your mouse but-
ton down on the red "box" and drag it out onto the Workplane.
Figure 9-7. You can click and drag shapes onto your Workplane
Getting Started with Tinkercad 125

You now have a basic shape you can adjust. If you click your red
box and hover your mouse over the small white squares at the
corners, dimensions will pop up as shown in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8. After clicking the box, small white squares appear at
the corners, allowing for resizing
The default dimensions of the box are 20mm wide by 20mm
deep by 20mm tall. Clicking and dragging those small squares
will resize the cube in that particular direction. Carefully roll your
mouse over a tiny white square, and it will turn red to indicate
that you can click-hold it. Sometimes it is hard to really click
that small white square, so have patience!
126 Getting Started with 3D Printing

These tiny white boxes and other shape modifiers are called
"handles," and they allow you to resize and reshape any object in
Tinkercad. See Figure 9-9.
Figure 9-9. Various handles on an object in Tinkercad
Here are descriptions of the various handles on your cube:
• Four white boxes on the bottom corners to resize the shape
in those directions
• Four black dots on the midlines between the white handles
that allow you to resize the shape by the edges instead of the
corners
• A white box on top of the object to make the shape taller
• A black arrow on top of the object to physically raise the
object off of the Workplane it is sitting on
• Three rotation arrows that allow you to rotate the shape in
any of the three directions (also note that you might not be
able to see one of the rotation handles until you rotate your
view around to the side of the box)
Getting Started with Tinkercad 127

Rotating an Object
There are two ways to rotate your object: by using your mouse
or by using the application itself. If you look in the top lefthand
corner of the main Tinkercad screen, you will see a disc with
movement controls as shown in Figure 9-10.
Figure 9-10. The navigation panel in Tinkercad
Clicking the arrows inside the "home" disc allows you to rotate
your object. Clicking the plus and minus (+ and -) signs allows
you to zoom in and out. Select an object by clicking it. The 3D
"box" symbol below the disc zooms your view into that object so
that it takes up the entire screen.
Helpful Shortcuts
If you want a keyboard shortcut to zoom into an
object, just click the object and hit the "f" key to
"focus" and the object will fill your screen. If you
want to get back to the default view, you can click
the "home" icon (in the disc) and your view will be
reset. In general you can navigate more easily with
your mouse than your keyboard.
128 Getting Started with 3D Printing

If you click the small question mark icon next to the home disc,
you will get a helpful pop-out window as shown in Figure 9-11.
Figure 9-11. Expanded navigation help menu on Tinkercad
Holding down the right mouse button will allow you to pan the
scene to see your design from different directions. Zooming is
accomplished by the mouse wheel. If you want a centered view
on a different part of your Workplane, then hold down the Shift
key while right-clicking to pan the scene.
Changing the Shape
Now that you have the basic movement down, it is time to start
creating your idea! If you resized the original red box by clicking
and dragging on the handles, you will have noticed that the
measurements have changed. These measurements can be
directly sent to a 3D printer and will be 3D printed accurately!
Resizing the Red Box
Resize the box to dimensions of 5mm high by 40mm wide by
60mm long, as shown in Figure 9-12.
Getting Started with Tinkercad 129

Figure 9-12. Resized original red box using handles
You now have a flat rectangular base. We'll use this as an exam-
ple of how to use shapes "negatively" as cutting tools to create
new shapes. This is a key concept not just in Tinkercad but in all
CAD programs.
In the righthand menu bar list of tools, scroll down to the "Sym-
bols" toolbox and drag a heart shape onto the Workplane. Any-
where is okay for now.
Click the heart shape and make sure it's selected before you
perform these steps:
• Using the tiny white box handles, make it 10mm high.
• Use the rotation arrow in the navigation tool to rotate it 90
degrees counterclockwise. Your Workplane should look like
Figure 9-13.
130 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 9-13. Stock heart shape rotated to a specific angle
As you click and drag on the rotate handles a grid will appear to
help you find the right degree-angle. As you are holding down
the left mouse button and rotating the object (if your mouse is
outside of the rotation circle) you will move in single-degree
increments. If your mouse is on the inside of the rotation circle,
your object will jump in 22.5-degree increments. Or in other
words, by these increments: 22.5, 45, 67.5, 90, etc.
You can rotate your view so that the heart is right-side up. Drag
your heart inside the rectangle near the corner, as shown in
Figure 9-14.
Getting Started with Tinkercad 131

Figure 9-14. Positioning the heart in the upper-left corner
Now comes the fun part! Click the heart to select it. In the top
right of your screen look at the window entitled "Inspector," as
shown in Figure 9-15.
Figure 9-15. Inspector window when an object is selected
Clicking the left box will allow you to change the color of the
pieces you selected, but for this step, click the "hole" box (sha-
ded gray strips) and see what happens to the heart!
132 Getting Started with 3D Printing

A Note on Color
Though you can change the color in Tinkercad, this
is only a visual aid for you. The end file that you
download for 3D printing will be in STL file format,
which does not have the ability to convey any sort of
color information. The final color of your object will
be whatever color filament or 3D printer feedstock
you are using.
The heart has now become gray striped to denote that it will be
used as a cutting tool. Your heart will look like the one shown in
Figure 9-16.
Figure 9-16. Heart changed to "hole" to denote it is now a cut-
ting tool. You are one step away from creating your first subtrac-
tive shape!
Getting Started with Tinkercad 133

Grouping and Ungrouping Shapes
Tinkercad is a "parametric" tool, which means that behind the
scenes, everything you are interacting with on the screen is
actually based on simple mathematics. The "parameters" that
you set for length, width, and height determine the shape of an
object. Also, Tinkercad has the concept of "nesting" or grouping
objects together. Objects that are grouped together have spe-
cial abilities that nongrouped objects do not.
Grouping objects in Tinkercad saves you a lot of time in that you
can move all of the grouped objects together all at once. And
here is another great feature of the grouping: you can create a
cutting tool (like the heart), then once you group the objects
together, you will actually see the effect of the cutting tool in
your model on all grouped parts!
Let's try the grouping function. In the upper-left corner of your
Workplane, click and hold your left mouse button and drag a box
around both the heart and the rectangle, selecting both of them.
In the top right of your screen, click the "Group" button as
shown in Figure 9-17.
Figure 9-17. Location of the Group button
134 Getting Started with 3D Printing

You will see a result that looks like Figure 9-18.
Figure 9-18. Result of grouping heart cutting tool and rectangle
The heart is now cut out of the rectangle! With Tinkercad being
a parametric modeling program, this also means that the opera-
tion you just completed of cutting the heart out of the block is
"non-destructive." That means that you can go back in to
change things around. This will not disrupt other objects in your
design. It's like it has a memory for what you did in layers.
Double-click with your left mouse button on the rectangle and
"enter" into the group you just created. You can change the
placement of the heart, or really any component that is in that
group. When you click outside of the grouped shapes, the vari-
ous cuts are performed based on the new locations of the
shapes. Conversely, you can also click the "Ungroup" button to
ungroup selected shapes.
Getting Started with Tinkercad 135

Finishing Your New Creation in
Tinkercad
The next steps of this tutorial will demonstrate how to further
customize your heart-plate using other customization tools:
1. Go to the Shape Generators to the right of your screen and
expand the menu bar to find the "Text" object tool as shown
in Figure 9-19.
Figure 9-19. Find the Text object tool
2. Drag the Text object out onto the Workplane as shown in
Figure 9-20.

Figure 9-20. Text object on the Workplane
3. Use the Inspector tool in the top right to change the "Text"
to something else as shown in Figure 9-21.

4. Drag the text into your nameplate (the rectangle) and resize
if necessary as shown in Figure 9-22.
Figure 9-22. Resized "Hello!" placed on the nameplate
5. With the text "Hello!" still selected, use the Inspector win-
dow in the top right to turn the Text object into a "hole" as
shown in Figure 9-23.

ton at the top right of the screen to see the result shown in
Figure 9-24.

7. Click "Design" in the top left of the Tinkercad window as
shown in Figure 9-25.

Getting Started with Tinkercad 139

8. Click "Download for 3D Printing," and then choose ".STL" as
shown in Figure 9-26. This is the file format you could 3D
print!
Figure 9-26. Saving file as STL from the Design menu
Congratulations! When you have an STL file from Tinkercad, you
can load that file into your 3D printer or upload it to an online
service bureau where they will 3D print your design for you.
Now that you understand the basics, we recommend that you
spend time playing around with Tinkercad on your own until you
feel comfortable with the features and controls. You will learn
best by doing, so don't be afraid to experiment.
What's Next?
In Chapter 10 we give you another CAD tutorial. We'll look at
Meshmixer, another fun and free CAD modeling software pro-
gram from Autodesk. This one has a medium level of complexity
but allows you to do far more with the software than what you
can do with Tinkercad.
If you already have Meshmixer installed on your computer, you
can double-click (or import) the STL file you just created into
Meshmixer for further editing, as shown in Figure 9-27.
140 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 9-27. The STL file loaded into Meshmixer
Some changes are needed to make the file more easily editable
in Meshmixer. You can do this by "remeshing" (using the Mesh-
mixer commands Edit → Remesh → Linear Subdivision a couple
of times) to make the model more complex so that Meshmixer
has enough triangles to work with. But, once the model has
enough triangles in it, you can do some fun things in Meshmixer
(Figure 9-28).

10/Getting Started
with Meshmixer
Meshmixer is another free program, and it is amazingly power-
ful. It's so useful that, if you 3D print a lot, you may find yourself
using Meshmixer before every print. Don't be fooled by the free
price and by our medium-level skill rating; it can be just the right
toolbox beginners need to print and create models as well as
something advanced users can use to create digital masterpie-
ces. Check out the model in Figure 10-1 for an example of the
kind of sculpted 3D model you can create with Meshmixer.
Figure 10-1. The two gray figures (top left) are from Meshmixer;
the other three models have had shading effects added in an
external program ("Madlon" by Gunter Weber/"MagWeb")
143

Meshmixer has tools for the creation of 3D models, as well as
tools that will help you successfully 3D print them. In this way,
Meshmixer is a unique product because it sits between the digi-
tal and physical worlds. Here are a few reasons why Meshmixer
is one of our most popular online 3D printing and 3D modeling
courses on Udemy.com:
• Meshmixer can be used not only to create all kinds of 3D
models, but also to help you translate those models into
physical products. This ability is unmatched by any other
software program.
• Even if you never end up 3D printing what you create, Mesh-
mixer is a powerful standalone digital creation tool.
• Meshmixer helps you get the most out of your own 3D
printer at home.
• Students, professionals, artists, hobbyists and designers,
and beginners and advanced modelers can all benefit from
learning Meshmixer.
• Meshmixer can be taught to ages 9 and up.
• There are over 80 tools in the program, many of which you
can start using right away.
Getting Started
Meshmixer is not browser-based like Tinkercad, so you will need
to download the program by visiting the official website. Go to
http://www.meshmixer.com and follow the instructions to
download and install Meshmixer on your computer.
When you first start Meshmixer you will be presented with a
menu of starting choices, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2. Meshmixer Start menu
144 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Before we get any further, let's go over some basic aspects of
Meshmixer:
• Left-clicking your mouse will select things on the screen, or
act as the brush when sculpting
• Holding down the right mouse button and dragging your
mouse will rotate the object
• Holding down the middle mouse button will pan the object
Figure 10-3 shows the lefthand side of the Meshmixer screen
with labels of the tool functions. You are able to access all the
tools of Meshmixer from these main icons.
Figure 10-3. Meshmixer Tool menu and descriptions
Starting the Tutorial
From the Start menu, click the rabbit in the lower-left corner.
This will load up the iconic "Stanford Bunny," which was 3D
scanned from a small statue in 1993 at Stanford University.
Once you click the icon, a bunny will appear on the screen. You
now have a 3D model to work with.
Now that you have the bunny on the screen, though, you will
need to "fix" it. Because this is a 3D model that was created by
3D scanning a real-world object, the scanner was only able to
capture the exposed surface areas of the bunny, and not the
parts where it was sitting on the table. To 3D print this bunny,
this "missing and open" part of the scan will need to be closed.
3D printing requires a closed, airtight model. Fortunately, Mesh-
mixer has some powerful tools that will evaluate and "fix" 3D
models to make them more 3D printable.
Begin by clicking Analysis → Inspector.
Getting Started with Meshmixer 145

You will see a blue "pin" popping out of the bottom of the bunny
as shown in Figure 10-4. This indicates that there is an issue
with the mesh in that location. You can easily see the big hole in
this 3D model, but some holes are harder to see, making this
tool very valuable. Meshmixer will find errors such as holes and
small disconnected parts with the Inspector tool. Make sure to
rotate your model all the way around with your right mouse but-
ton to see all pins that might be hidden from view.
Figure 10-4. Analysis and Inspector tools on the bunny model
Next, click the blue pin (or the "Auto Repair All" button in the
Inspector tool), and you will see the bottom of the bunny fill in.
Click Done, and your bunny will be corrected for 3D printing as
shown in Figure 10-5.
146 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Always Use Inspector
Whether you get 3D models from the Internet or cre-
ate your own models, it is always a good idea to run
them through the Inspector tool to see if there are
any problems with it. Sometimes more advanced
repair is needed, but often the Inspector tool does a
great job automatically!
Figure 10-5. Bunny model is fixed using the Inspector tool
Getting Started with Meshmixer 147

Sculpt with Digital Clay
As we mentioned, Meshmixer has more than 80 amazing tools.
One of the most fun to play with is the Sculpt tool. Let's make
the bunny more interesting by creating some wings to allow it to
fly:
1. Click the Sculpt tool on the left menu.
2. Click Brushes and select the "Draw" tool. The Draw tool
allows you to add to and create volume in the model, as if
you were applying more "clay" to it.
Before you start modifying the bunny, notice that there are
settings that affect your brushes on the lefthand side. These
options have a dramatic effect on how the tools work. For
now, open up the settings windows to access the properties
and refinement areas Figure 10-6, and adjust the settings to
match the following.
In the properties area:
• Strength: 77
• Size: 55
• Depth: 0
• "Flow" and "Volumetric" should be checked
In the refinement area:
• "Enable Refinement" should be checked
• Refine: 100
• Reduce: 100
• Smooth: 9
3. Now, rotate your view so that you are looking at the left
shoulder of the bunny. Hold your left mouse button down on
the shoulder area, and while keeping the left mouse button
down, start moving back and forth in a line as in Figure 10-6.
If you spend a bit more time in the center than you do at the
edges, you will be slowly building up a wing on the bunny.
148 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 10-6. Properties and refinement areas are adjusted in the
Sculpt tool
A Note on Sculpting
Many sculpting commands (including the Draw
command) will build toward you, in other words
toward the viewpoint from which you are looking at
the model. So, as you are "drawing" the bunny's
wing, it might seem as if you are just drawing a line...
but if you rotate around, you will see that the wing is
being "drawn" toward you.
4. Once you have drawn one wing, rotate your view to the other
shoulder with the right mouse button, and "draw" another
wing so that your bunny can properly fly as shown in
Figure 10-7.
Getting Started with Meshmixer 149

Figure 10-7. Both wings have been added to the bunny
Adding Support Structures
We talked about the need for support structures in previous
chapters, and Meshmixer is a truly unique program in its ability
to help you successfully 3D print. One standout feature of Mesh-
mixer is the creation of support structures that will support
overhanging areas of your model so that they will not droop dur-
ing 3D printing. Let's create some of those support structures
now:
1. On the lefthand menu, click Analysis → Overhangs.
2. Change the top option from "Custom Settings" to "Ulti-
maker2." You will see that certain places on your model have
turned red as shown in Figure 10-8. Those are the areas that
qualify for the generation of support structures, based on
the settings you entered in the menu on the left. You can
change these settings to what works best once you learn the
capabilities of your specific 3D printer. (The Ultimaker2
150 Getting Started with 3D Printing

printer was chosen for this example, but a different choice
may be appropriate for your specific printer. You can always
use one of the prefigured settings as a starting point for your
own printer's needs.)

3. Click the "[1] Generate Support" button.
You just told the program to create support structures to
keep your model in place during the printing process. Mesh-
mixer will think about the support structure generation for a
few seconds, and then support structures will appear as
shown in Figure 10-9! As we mentioned before, these sup-
port structures can be edited and removed at will, or regen-
erated after you change your settings. For you, learning how
well your 3D printer prints at specific angles and with spe-
cific materials will be part of the learning curve.

4. Click "[2] Convert to Solid" to lock in the support structures
as actual 3D models themselves.
5. A menu will pop up, asking if you want to create a "New
Object" or "Replace Existing" object on the screen. Click
Replace Existing as shown in Figure 10-10.
You will be brought out of the support structure generation util-
ity and back into the main interface. You can click the Export
button on the bottom left of the side menu to save this model
for 3D printing if you desire, or you can play around with editing
the bunny or even the new support structures as shown in
Figure 10-11.

Creating a Sphere
We've shown you how to fix a model, use the Sculpt tool, and
generate supports. Now let's change gears for a moment and
practice on more Meshmixer tools. Let's leave the bunny by
clicking the top-left File menu, and then selecting Import
Sphere, as shown in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12. Creating a new file by choosing Import Sphere
154 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Meshmixer will ask you if you want to "append" or "replace" the
bunny. For this step choose "replace." You will now have a
sphere, as shown in Figure 10-13.
Figure 10-13. Newly created sphere from File menu option
Getting Started with Meshmixer 155

You will be creating some very cool jewelry in this exercise. But
we first need to start with some base geometry:
1. Start by segmenting the sphere a few times. (You'll discover
why later on.) Click the Edit button on the lefthand menu
and you will see a Plane Cut pop-up window, as shown in
Figure 10-14.
Figure 10-14. The Plane Cut pop-up window from the Edit menu
option
2. Select the options in the pop-up box to:
• Slice Groups
• NoFill
3. Click Accept.
You will see a ball that is gray on the top side and colored on
the other, as shown in Figure 10-14. The "Slice Groups" com-
mand splits the sphere into two separate "FaceGroups."
FaceGroups are simply areas of the mesh that allow you to
156 Getting Started with 3D Printing

manipulate them without touching the other parts of the
mesh. They are denoted by a different mesh color. Your color
might be different than the one shown in Figure 10-15.
Figure 10-15. Using the Plane Cut option on a sphere to create
FaceGroups
4. Click the Edit tool again and then Plane Cut.
Getting Started with Meshmixer 157

5. Choose the same options as before: Slice Groups and NoFill.
You did this before, but this time either click and drag a line
with your left mouse button in another direction, or click the
various arrows and bars on the "manipulator widget" in the
center to move the cutting plane to a new direction as shown
in Figure 10-16.
Figure 10-16. Using the manipulator widget in the center to
move the cutting plane in a new direction

6. Click Accept and you will see a new FaceGroup appear.
Do this procedure two or three more times, and you will get a
sphere that looks like the one shown in Figure 10-17.
Figure 10-17. Sphere with many FaceGroups
Here is the fun part! "Make Pattern" is one of the flashiest and
most powerful tools in Meshmixer. It is what you will use to
make a piece of jewelry out of this colorful sphere.
7. Click the Edit button and go to Make Pattern.
Getting Started with Meshmixer 159

8. Switch the drop-down menu on the lefthand side to Face-
Group Borders (very top).
You will see a preview of what will happen to your mesh, as
shown in Figure 10-18.
Figure 10-18. FaceGroup Borders option on the sphere
9. Click Accept.
You now have a mesh that follows the borders of those Face-
Groups and can be turned into a complex pendant, as shown
in Figure 10-19. You could have this piece 3D printed in plas-
tics or metals by online service bureaus. This would be con-
sidered a more advanced model to print at home, due to the
amount of support material you would need, but you cer-
tainly could print it yourself.

Online Tutorials
If you are looking for more in-depth online training
we recommend our course called 3D Printing and 3D
Design Using Autodesk's Meshmixer. There are 159
lectures and over 16 hours of step-by-step instruc-
tion you can pace at your own level. In this course
you will learn some other very popular, fun, and easy
tools like "Dragging and Dropping," which is exactly
like it sounds. You can pick pre-created shapes/
objects and drop them onto your starter model as
shown in Figure 10-20.

This has been a brief introduction to the power and versatility of
Meshmixer. We invite you to play around with the other tools in
this program to see what you can create. To further your under-
standing, be sure to also check out the online tutorials provided
by Meshmixer on the Autodesk 123D YouTube channel.
In the next chapter, we will introduce you to Autodesk Fusion
360, which is considered a professional-level CAD program. It is
designed specifically for manufacturing but is nonetheless very
affordable for individuals.
162 Getting Started with 3D Printing

11/Getting Started
with Fusion 360
While Tinkercad and Meshmixer are good, free programs, it's
pretty much guaranteed that the car you drive or the computer
you use were not designed with those tools. To create 3D mod-
els that can be sent to manufacturers for production, designers
need to use more advanced tools such as Autodesk's Fusion
360. Figure 11-1 shows an example of the complexity of objects
that can be created in this program.
Figure 11-1. An electric race car toy that was completely
designed in Fusion 360 (modeled by and courtesy of David Bar-
rett of Virginia Tech)
This software enables the creation of complicated models and it
costs a fraction of what normal software in this league would
cost. At the time of this writing, the cost of Fusion 360 is fairly
unique in the software market:
• Free for personal/student use
163

• Free for commercial use for anyone until their business
makes more than $100,000 per year
• After that, Fusion costs $25/month when you pre-pay for a
year
This pricing allows users full access to a very powerful software
program, without having to pay for an expensive commercial
license that can cost thousands of dollars. In fact, most of the
CAD models we create in our rapid prototyping business are
made in Fusion 360. It is a powerful tool for professional work.
Polygonal Versus Parametric
Modeling
An in-depth tutorial covering all the rich features of Fusion 360
is beyond the scope of this introductory book. We'll provide you
with a basic introduction to help you understand how the pro-
gram works and how to get started using it. Before we jump into
the tutorial, however, we want to remind you about the differ-
ence between polygonal and parametric modeling. The STL file
format that 3D scanners make, and that Meshmixer uses, gen-
erates hundreds or thousands or even millions of small triangles
(which are really just three-sided polygons) to create an object.
These triangles create a shell of the object rather than a solid
with volume. Imagine casting a fishing net over an object. The
fishing net is like an STL file that shells the object.
Parametric modeling, by contrast, uses parameters to define a
model. Parameters are another way of saying changeable math-
ematical formulae. When you look at a model on the screen you
are seeing how one formula interacts with another, which is why
CAD programs are able to make huge changes in the model very
quickly.
Fusion 360 creates what are called "solid models" that will have
a defined volume and weight based on the material assigned to
them. For example, you can make parametric models for
objects that are made out of concrete and others for objects
made out of rubber. Each of those models can have simulations
run against them to illustrate what would happen to the objects
in the real world if specific stresses were placed on them. After
164 Getting Started with 3D Printing

all, the density or other material properties of something in a
CAD program like Fusion 360 is just another formula to calcu-
late.
Fusion 360 is a great example of a parametric modeling pro-
gram. The file output of Fusion 360 can be STL (triangles) or
parametric file formats (more-than-three-sided shapes) such as
STEP and IGES, which are used in traditional manufacturing.
Parametric modeling allows you to go back in time and change
values based on choices you may make later. These changes
can be made at any time, and they will cascade throughout the
design, all the while keeping the object in proper shape. For
example, if you changed the shape of a window on a house, the
walls would adjust accordingly and you would not have to go
back and make changes to them as well. That is because the
models are based on parameters, and Fusion 360 recalculates
all of the formulas accordingly.
Getting Started with Fusion 360
As we mentioned, all the features of Fusion 360 are too numer-
ous to cover in this tutorial, however, being exposed to Fusion
360 is important if you want to someday advance past Tinker-
cad and Meshmixer. The following beginning tutorial in Fusion
360 is for anyone looking to add more advanced features to
their CAD modeling software toolkit.
In the following steps you will be designing a ring. If you have not
done so already, download and install Fusion 360.
You will need to create a free Autodesk account to use the soft-
ware. You might have already started an account if you signed
up for Tinkercad or Meshmixer.
Fusion 360 is partially cloud-based. It does not require a con-
nection to the Internet for you to do the modeling, but you will
have the best experience on a computer that is actively connec-
ted to the Internet. The "offline" mode should only be used
when your Internet connection is temporarily not available. The
main computations are done on your computer, and the only
time you need the Internet connection is to save and sync your
Getting Started with Fusion 360 165

CAD design models. All files are securely saved to the Autodesk
cloud for access on any computer you might be using.
When you start Fusion 360 for the first time, you will see the
screen shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2. Fusion 360 start screen
There are four different training tutorials that show the major
functions of Fusion 360. We strongly advise that you go through
these at some point, if not before this tutorial. You can always
access these training videos by clicking the small question mark
in the upper-right part of the main Fusion 360 window and then
selecting Step By Step Tutorials.
For now, close this window and return to the main Fusion 360
interface window, as shown in Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-3. The main interface window of Fusion 360
166 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Description of Interface Menu
Let's look at the different modeling environments (features) you
can access in the main screen, starting from the top left and
moving toward the right:
Model
The feature you will work with the most is called the "Model"
environment and is where you create 3D shapes. If you click
the down arrow underneath Model you will see completely
different areas of Fusion 360 that allow you to create photo-
realistic renderings of your 3D models, toolpaths for CNC
mills, and even a simulation workspace where you can test
how your model will react to different physical stresses in
the real world.
Create
This offers two types of creation environments: one (the
blue cube) for geometric shapes and the other (the purple
wired box) for creating organic forms that are more fluid and
able to be sculpted.
You can have a mix of geometric and sculpted shapes in your
model, and that is what we will be doing later in the chapter.
If you click the small down arrow in the Create menu, you will
see all the options of things you can create (boxes, pipes,
sweeps, etc.).
Modify
This feature lets you modify shapes by creating fillets (roun-
ded edges) or chamfered (angled) corners, as well as many
other operations.
Assemble
Once you have more than one shape, you can define joints
between those shapes, and see them move as a unit. This
test allows you to see if there are collisions within the objects
selected. This is a very useful tool before you go to the 3D
printing stage.
Getting Started with Fusion 360 167

Sketch
This menu has a lot of tools that allow you to create 2D
shapes that you can later "pop out" or "extrude" into 3D
shapes.
Construct
If you want to create new geometric shapes somewhere
away from existing shapes, you will use this tool to construct
new work planes to position your new models on.
Inspect
This feature allows you to see more information about your
object. You can measure distances, or even get a cutaway
view (called a section analysis) of the inside of your object.
Insert
Using this feature, if you take a reference photo with your
cell phone camera, you can import that image and use it as a
kind of tracing paper for your model. Also, if you have an
SVG file that you imported from Inkscape or Illustrator, you
can insert it directly into Fusion 360 and extrude it into a 3D
shape very quickly.
Make
This function allows you to save your models as STL files, as
well as giving you instant access to online 3D printing ser-
vice bureaus for 3D printing price quotes.
Add-Ins
Fusion 360 also has a scripting language where you can cre-
ate your own scripts to do specific things, or get "apps" from
the Autodesk marketplace to enhance Fusion 360. If you
know how to program, you can create specialized tools for
others to use, using the add-in functionality.
Select
This feature allows you to select specific parts of the model
to be modified.
Movement Box
Click and drag this feature to rotate your model in any direc-
tion.
168 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Now that you've downloaded Fusion 360 and taken a brief tour
of the features, it's time to try it out.
Making a Ring in Fusion 360
In this tutorial you will be designing a ring that could be 3D
printed either at home or through an online service bureau. The
steps can be followed precisely, or you can get creative with
some of the sculpting functions and add your own features. It's
really up to you!
Start by creating the band of the ring:
1. Click the small arrow underneath the Sketch icon.
2. Click Create Sketch. Your screen will turn a different color as
shown in Figure 11-4. As you move your mouse around the
screen, Fusion 360 will ask you what "plane" you want to
create that new sketch on.
Figure 11-4. Selected plane in Fusion 360
Getting Started with Fusion 360 169

3. Select the bottom plane.
Now you are in Sketching mode.
4. Under the Sketch icon click Circle, then Center Diameter Cir-
cle as shown in Figure 11-5.
We are creating a women's size 7 ring. For the benefit of this
tutorial we researched that the inside diameter of a size 7
ring is 17.3mm.
Figure 11-5. In the Sketch mode, choose Circle and Center
Diameter Circle
5. Click once on the small circle. Where the red and green lines
converge is where the origin is marked. As you move your
mouse you will see how large the diameter of that circle is,
as shown in Figure 11-6.
170 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Figure 11-6. Drawing a circle with specific dimensions
6. Type 17.3 as shown in Figure 11-7. Then press Enter twice.
Figure 11-7. A sketch circle with a diameter of 17.3mm
7. That's all you need for the circle at this point so click Stop
Sketch in the top right of the menu bar to get back to the
main modeling environment.
Now that we have a base circle, let's create some 3D geome-
try.
Getting Started with Fusion 360 171

8. Click the small arrow under Create and select Pipe as shown
in Figure 11-8.
Figure 11-8. Selection of Pipe option under the Create icon
9. Click the edge of the circle. A 3D model will be generated
and a menu will pop up as shown in Figure 11-9.
Figure 11-9. A 3D pipe appears with a menu option
172 Getting Started with 3D Printing

10. Select the following settings in the pop-up menu:
• Set both Distance settings to 1.
• Change the Section Size to 1 and then click OK.
You just made a simple ring with a 1mm-thick cross-section, as
shown in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-10. The completed band of the ring
But wait!
Let's think through the measurements of this model. Remember
that you created a band to fit a size 7 finger, which we know is
supposed to have a 17.3mm wide interior diameter. But we had
you create a 1mm pipe, which extends inward by .5mm and out-
ward by .5mm, on both sides for a total size reduction of 1mm
from what you wanted. Now the interior diameter is actually
16.3mm! If you printed this ring, it would be 1mm too small!
(Always conduct a logical "walkthrough" of your steps to see if
they make sense.)
Never fear, it is easy to fix these things in a parametric modeling
program.
Getting Started with Fusion 360 173

At the bottom of your screen you will find a "history" of all of the
actions you took. Do you see the initial sketch there, as well as a
pipe command? Let's go in and edit that sketch.
11. Double-click the first Sketch icon on the bottom left of the
screen, just to the right of the Play commands, as shown in
Figure 11-11. This will bring you back into the initial sketch
you made.
Figure 11-11. Arrow showing the "history" that is being built as
you work in Fusion 360. Double-clicking any item will allow you to
change that item.
174 Getting Started with 3D Printing

12. To fix the model and make it larger, double-click the "17.3"
number and edit it. You can also use arithmetic operations in
there as well! It is valid to type either 17.3+1 or 18.3.
13. Change 17.3 to 18.3 either by directly typing that number in,
or doing the addition as shown in Figure 11-12.
Figure 11-12. In the sketch environment, double-clicking the
diameter number allows for editing. The field entry now reads
"17.3+1."
Getting Started with Fusion 360 175

You will now be left with a circle that is 18.3mm in diameter.
Figure 11-13 shows a close-up view of the new value of the diam-
eter.
Figure 11-13. Close-up view of changed diameter
14. Click Stop Sketch to return to the main environment.
Notice your ring updated in the background to 18.3mm in
diameter, but the pipe is still 2mm. The effective inner size is
now 17.3mm, which is what we wanted.
176 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Adding an Embellishment to the
Ring
Now, let's put a topper on that ring to make it more interesting!
15. Click the purple grid-box in the Create icon at the top to
enter into Sculpting mode as shown in Figure 11-14.
Figure 11-14. Purple grid-box has been selected in the Create
function and Fusion 360 is now in the Sculpting environment
16. After entering into Sculpting mode, click the top leftmost
shape that looks like a 4 x 4 x 4 cube with rounded edges.
17. Click the same plane as you did before to create a cube on
the bottom plane. The view will reorient to that plane. Then,
Getting Started with Fusion 360 177

position the cube around the "top" of the ring, somewhat
overlapping the shaded ring, as shown in Figure 11-15.
Figure 11-15. Positioning the 4 x 4 x 4 rounded-edge cube above
and touching the ring
18. Let's pretend we are jewelry designers and happen to know
the settings shown in Figure 11-15:
• Length: 20mm
• Length Faces: 2
• Width: 10mm
• Width Faces: 2
• Height: 10mm
• Height Faces: 2
• Direction: Symmetric
• Symmetry: Mirror
• Check all the symmetry boxes: Length, Width, Height
• Operation: New Body
These settings are just for this project but you can play
around with changing them now, or go back into your design
and change them later.
178 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Adding to the Embellishment
You just created a sculptable box of parametric clay in the last
few steps, so let's make it look unique!
19. Hover your mouse on top of the box. Click one of the top
faces and it will turn blue as shown in Figure 11-16.
The other top faces will turn yellow to indicate that symme-
try is turned on; a change made to one face will affect the
other faces in that object.
Figure 11-16. A face of the box has been selected, turning it
blue. The Modify function has been selected.
20. On the top menu bar click the down arrow under Modify and
select Edit Form as shown in Figure 11-16. A manipulator
widget will appear, and as you drag those various arrows and
sliders, your form will change as shown in Figure 11-17. You
Getting Started with Fusion 360 179

might have to use the navigation cube in the top-right part of
the screen by clicking it and dragging it to rotate the view.
21. Click the slider circle as shown in Figure 11-17 and move that
upward a bit. This will rotate the plane inward. Because you
have symmetry turned on, all of the other faces will turn
inward as well.
Figure 11-17. Twisting the faces inward using one of the manip-
ulator widget handles
22. Turn that slider to -45 degrees as shown in the white entry
window in Figure 11-17. Don't worry about changing any
other settings in the pop-up window.
Before clicking OK, you can now manipulate other faces as
well. If you happened to click OK before you were ready, that
is fine; just right-click anywhere on the screen and select
Edit Form again and click where you want to start sculpting.
180 Getting Started with 3D Printing

23. Click the intersection point between all four faces on the
righthand side of the cube. Drag that point inward as shown
in Figure 11-18.
You can also use Edit Form on faces, individual edges, or
even the points where the edges meet. Just make sure that
whatever shape you create intersects with the band of the
ring that you made earlier.
Figure 11-18. Within the Edit Form option, a small intersection
at the right was selected and dragged inward
24. When you have a shape that you like, click Finish Form on
the top menu bar to exit out of the sculpting environment.
You now have a ring and a topper!
Getting Started with Fusion 360 181

Exporting Your Model for 3D
Printing
The final step is to export the model into your 3D printing soft-
ware, and you're all set to go.
Fusion 360 can only export one model at a time, so you will need
to combine the ring and its topper into one shape before export-
ing so that it all prints together.
25. Click the arrow under Modify and then select Combine as
shown in Figure 11-19.
Figure 11-19. Initiating the Modify → Combine command to
merge the shapes
182 Getting Started with 3D Printing

26. Click the ring first and then the topper.
One will be selected as the "Target" body and one will be the
"Tool" body. Again, make sure that the Combine option is
selected as shown in Figure 11-20.
Figure 11-20. Target and Tool bodies selected in Combine com-
mand
27. Click OK. You now have one shape you can export for 3D
printing!
28. Under the "Bodies" hierarchy in the left menu, find the single
body you just created, and right-click it.
Getting Started with Fusion 360 183

29. Select the "Save As STL" option and select "High quality" as
shown in Figure 11-21.
Figure 11-21. Selecting Save As STL on the combined body
Congratulations! You are all set to load the model into your 3D
printer's slicer software, generate support structures, and print
a 3D object.
184 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Combining Shapes from Meshmixer
Remember Meshmixer from the previous chapter?
You can bring the ring model into Meshmixer by
importing the STL file, and then you can add organic
shapes as shown in Figure 11-22.
Figure 11-22. Your ring with topper imported into
Meshmixer with a premade bear's head shape added
In this chapter you learned how to create a ring with a specific
diameter, attach a custom sculpted topper, and combine them
together to make a finished model that is ready to export for 3D
printing. If you created a version of your own that you really like,
post it on Thingiverse.com (or another online 3D model reposi-
tory) and share it with the world!
In the next chapter, we'll talk about setting up your own maker-
space for 3D printing. It has practical tips on what to buy, use,
and display to have the best 3D printing experience!
Getting Started with Fusion 360 185


12/Setting Up Your
Personal Makerspace
for 3D Printing
Whether you call it a makerspace or FabLab or hackerspace or
community workshop, the names all refer to community spaces
where creativity and exploration are valued over "getting it right
the first time." These community-operated physical spaces are
where regular people with common interests can meet, social-
ize, and make.
The people who use makerspaces share one thing first and fore-
most: the desire to experiment, tinker, invent, and learn. The
actual tools that exist in a makerspace come second to that
inventive drive, and in fact, many makerspaces start out with
nothing more than a group of people coming together to help
each other learn. Often makerspaces will have 3D printers, laser
cutters, CNC machines, electronics components, and various
hand tools, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1. FabLab: The Science Dissemination Unit (SDU) in
Trieste, Italy (Moreno Soppelsa/Shutterstock.com)

The goal of this chapter is to help you create much the same
feeling and functionality in your home as you would find at a
public makerspace. Creating the perfect makerspace is not
about how many tools and pieces of equipment you have.
Rather, it is about making sure you are able to be creative and
productive.
So, don't feel as if you need to spend a lot of money on fancy
tools or have the perfectly organized space (Figure 12-2) in
order to make a space you can create in!
Figure 12-2. The perfectly organized mythical makerspace
In reality, your makerspace likely won't be as neat as in the
image. Even with the best of intentions, your makerspace will
more likely end up looking like a mad scientist lives there
(Figure 12-3) and that's actually a good sign!

Getting Ready
Here are three essential tasks we recommend you do to get
ready to start 3D printing at home, along with advice on how
best to accomplish them. You'll find it's really helpful to have
your space well set up before you begin! We've provided a
checklist at the end of the chapter so you can make sure you
have the essential tools.
Task 1: Research Which 3D Printer
to Buy
You don't need a 3D printer to participate in this technology but
a 3D printing space wouldn't be the same without... well... a 3D
printer. In Chapters 4, 5, and 6 of this book, we identified 3D
printer qualities to look for when purchasing a 3D printer, but
this section will give you more insights.
At last count, there were more than 200+ 3D printer manufac-
turers in the consumer market. They range from startups to
multimillion-dollar companies. To get a real sense of the manu-
facturer's quality, we recommend you visit their forums and
read the comments other owners have made.
Setting Up Your Personal Makerspace for 3D Printing 189

Decide how much or how little time you want to spend building
and maintaining the printer yourself. We put together our first
3D printer, the Mendel Max 2.0, as shown in Figure 12-4, on our
dining room table. It took 16 hours over the course of 3 days. We
learned a lot from the experience, but, if you don't have the time
or patience, we recommend you buy one already assembled.
Pre-assembled 3D printers are more expensive but worth the
money if you would rather focus on 3D CAD modeling or 3D
printing rather than learning all the "ins and outs" of how a 3D
printer works. Assembled or not, you will still have to learn how
to maintain the 3D printer. For tips, read Chapters 4, 5, and 6.

Task 2: Create a Safe Work Area
Whether you decide you want your makerspace to be in your
garage, home office, or shed, you will want to make sure you
have a safe environment and one that is conducive to your well-
being.
You want to be able to move around the workspace easily, have
good lighting, tape down your various power cords so you don't
trip over them, and have a fire extinguisher within 6 feet. Just in
case.
In general, 3D printers are safe machines, but you will want to
take precautions to make them safe for other members of your
household, including spouses, kids, pets, visiting relatives, and
curious neighbors. Certain components of the 3D printer (like
any machine) need to have some "look only" areas explained in
order to keep everyone safe.
One example of a "look only" area is the extruder (or hot end).
You should take caution to not allow anyone to touch the
extruder assembly while it's in operation, as shown in
Figure 12-5. The nozzle can reach hundreds of degrees in tem-
perature.
Figure 12-5. Some 3D printers have easily accessible heating
elements. Avoid touching the extruder assembly when the 3D
printer is in operation. (We turned it off to take this picture!)
Setting Up Your Personal Makerspace for 3D Printing 191

There are other components you need to watch. Many 3D print-
ers have belts and rods that move, which can present pinch haz-
ards. Exercise caution and make sure to keep fingers, hair, and
clothing away from the moving parts when they are in operation
(Figure 12-6).
Figure 12-6. 3D printer belt and pulley crushing paper, showing
the potential pinch hazards
Many 3D printer kits have exposed electrical wires and non-
enclosed electrical components. 3D printers also run on electri-
cal power from a wall outlet, so normal appliance caution is war-
ranted.
When you are removing a print from the print bed with a sharp
spatula, watch your fingers to avoid getting cut. When removing
support material from a 3D print, wear protective glasses and
make sure your peripheral tools (picks, rotary sanding tools) are
stored in a safe place. There are more safety tips you will learn
from user forums, the manufacturer's website, and experience.
192 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Good Ventilation Is Recommended
Although many say that the fumes from heating fila-
ment in a 3D printer are safe, we feel it's prudent to
run a HEPA filter near your 3D printer and/or to have
some sort of ventilation near an open window that
isn't blowing directly on the 3D printer. The filament
material ABS, for example, smells much stronger
than PLA for a reason. The "S" in ABS stands for
"styrene," which is a known irritant to the respiratory
system.
If you want to learn more, take a look at a study done
by the University of Illinois that tested 3D printers
for fumes emitted by FDM printers. The study found
that 3D printers while in operation produced nano-
particle emissions similar to or higher than cooking
with a gas stove. These nanoparticles can be absor-
bed more easily into the respiratory system than
other types of particles so it is important to provide
for the best ventilation you can. The study did not
say what effects those nanoparticles would have on
a typical person, but the study did state that ABS
produced 10x the emissions of PLA—which is why
we recommend printing with PLA.
Task 3: Choose the Best Physical
Environment for Your 3D Printer
One of the nice things about creating a makerspace for your 3D
printing work area is that the actual equipment, tools, and
accessories can be contained in a relatively small area. Many
people even use 3D printers directly on the same desk as their
computer! We recommend, however, that you use a table that is
dedicated to the 3D printer, and we'll tell you why a little further
down this section.
In the beginning of our business, we had more failed 3D prints
than we care to remember. It often took hours of trial and error
to figure out what factors actually caused the failure. You can
Setting Up Your Personal Makerspace for 3D Printing 193

get a jump ahead by learning from our experience! Here are our
top items to consider when choosing the best environment for
your printer:
• Does the room temperature fluctuate too much? Garages
are notorious for heat and cold fluctuations. In the summer
they are too hot, in the winter too cold. Too-high tempera-
tures can negatively affect the viscosity of resin, as well as
causing stepper motors to not work properly and potentially
overheat. Find a place where you can control the tempera-
ture and keep it around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. We print in
our garage, so we bought a powerful heating and cooling air
conditioning unit to moderate the temperatures. Check the
BTU ratings before you buy, and make sure the ratings
match the size of your room.
• Do you have kids? We have a very curious three-year-old
who loves to get his hands on anything that is off limits.
Assume little hands will want to touch the sound-making,
toy-producing machine and place your 3D printer appropri-
ately out of their hands' reach. In addition to their safety, any
stray touch can upset the calibration of the printer bed and
cause prints to fail.
• Beware of airflow and sunlight. An errant breeze from an air
conditioning unit that you cannot feel unless your hand is
behind the printer can spell disaster on your printing pro-
cess, cooling some sections of your print but not others. An
open window can bring some unwanted heat or air currents
as well (you should have proper ventilation; just be sure to
place the printer not in line with air currents). If you're print-
ing with resin, you will want your print station away from
sources of UV light in order to not prematurely cure your
resin!
• Beware of unwanted movement. Whether you have a high-
traffic area or an unstable table that jerks too much when
the 3D printer head is moving back and forth, realize that
every bump and shake of the table can affect your printer in
unwanted ways! Earlier we mentioned that it's not a good
idea to have your 3D printer on the same desk as your com-
puter. This is why.
194 Getting Started with 3D Printing

• Your workstation should be within good distance of a power
outlet that you can use with surge protectors. It's preferred
that your work table not be placed against a wall so that you
can move around all sides freely. 3D printers need mainte-
nance, and some have components located on the back that
you might need to access frequently.
• 3D printers make noise. Some models can take hours or
days to print. We recommend not placing the printer in your
bedroom, of course, or near a shared wall of your bedroom.
• If your printer does not come with the ability to self-manage
its own prints, you will need to dedicate a computer to the
printing process for the entirety of the print. Make sure your
computer does not enter into sleep mode during the print!
• Store your materials properly! We talked about proper stor-
age and handling of both filament and resin in Chapters 4
and 5 respectively, but it is worth stating again. Many fila-
ments absorb moisture from the air, and keeping that mois-
ture out will be one key to successful prints. Though resin
does not have moisture issues, temperature changes can
cause failed prints when working with resin.
Setting up shop in your garage? Here are some special consid-
erations and suggestions to keep in mind:
• Dust is not your friend. Keeping the garage area, floor, and
workspace free of dust will help prevent dust from being an
unwanted part of your print!
• As mentioned before, try to get the temperature to stay as
consistent as possible. We have a lot of windows in our
garage, so using 3M foil tape helped keep the temperature
inside more consistent.
• Keep open windows about 6 feet away from your printer to
allow for proper ventilation. Or use a HEPA filter that is rated
for VOCs. Weather permitting, open the garage door to get
good ventilation.
• If possible, the environment in your garage should be rela-
tively dry because too much moisture could render the fila-
ment unusable. Filament should remain dry and stored
Setting Up Your Personal Makerspace for 3D Printing 195

properly in a plastic bin with silica packs, on the floor of the
garage.
• If you keep a refrigerator or freezer in your garage, set up
your workspace on the opposite side of the garage. We don't
recommend that your printer share power outlets with other
major appliances like refrigerators, freezers, washing
machines and dryers, etc.
• Learn more tips from online sources like the Google+ com-
munity for 3D printing. This community has over 200K
members and is very active.
Things We Recommend for Your
Home Setup
Whether you are printing with an SLA or an FDM printer, your
physical home makerspace setup will be similar. Keep in mind,
though, that SLA printing requires an extra water source/post-
processing area. Following is a list of things we recommend you
have for your personal 3D printing setup. As you develop your
skill and techniques, you may add more items to your list.
Setting up the space:
• Have at least a 3' x 3' x 3' space for the printer and your work
area.
• Get a standard tabletop or workbench. You may need one or
two of these depending on the size of your 3D printer. Each
should be at least 24" x 24" with a 28" sitting height.
• Locate and use a nearby electrical outlet with an attached
surge protector to protect the printer.
• Allocate a space for your computer (if your printer requires a
physical connection to one).
• Have handy a standard USB cable to connect the printer to
your desktop computer or laptop (if necessary). Your printer
may have come with one.
196 Getting Started with 3D Printing

Printing and processing items:
• Have one of the following to help prints stick to the build
plate: extra-strength glue stick, blue painter's tape (try to
find 2" wide or wider if possible), or for those of you printing
with a heated build plate, Kapton tape. If using painter's
tape, avoid brands with excessively waxy residue that might
prevent adhesion.
• Get a 3D printer toolkit (for edging and scraping excess glue
off the print bed after printing). Octave 3D Printer Tool Kit A
is a good choice for around $20.
• Buy a thin spatula (to help remove prints from the build
plate). We like using a thin cookie spatula, sometimes mar-
keted as a scrapbooking tool in arts & crafts stores.
• Consider a small blowtorch for resurfacing and finishing
print jobs.
• Buy flush-cut wire cutters. We recommend the Hakko
CHP-170 Micro Clean Cutter with 16-gauge maximum cut-
ting capacity (usually available from Amazon and other
online retailers for under ten dollars).
• Buy wide angle and needle nose pliers (for support structure
removal, as well as for removing parts from the build plate).
Cleaning up afterwards:
• A small wastebasket for discarded pieces of the print or
small pieces of filament you cut off when changing filament.
Or, for a failed print.
• Paper towels (and water) to clean the build plate if using the
glue stick.
• Clean cloth to remove excess glue from the print bed after
completing a print.
• A wire brush to clean the extruder's toothed gear if the teeth
get jammed with filament, or if the nozzle gets small pieces
of debris on it.
• .3mm (.012") guitar string to feed back up through your noz-
zle if you get a clog.
Setting Up Your Personal Makerspace for 3D Printing 197

Materials and storage:
• An airtight bin you can store your filament in to control mois-
ture absorption. Five-gallon paint buckets (with lids) are a
great option here!
• Rechargeable desiccant canisters to keep the air in the bin
as dry as possible.
• A suitable supply of "feedstock." This would be filament for
the FDM printers or resin for the SLA printers. For FDM, a
starting purchase of just one spool will last quite a long time,
and somewhere around 1 liter of resin will be a good starting
amount.
• Large storage unit (preferably with wheels) to store materi-
als such as unused filament, tools, cables, acetone, etc.
Miscellaneous:
• Good lighting (via light fixtures or natural, but indirect, light).
Remember that direct light from a window can negatively
affect the ambient room temperature.
• Indoor fans/heater (if the room doesn't have a way of regu-
lating the temperature already).
• Zip ties for securing wiring when repairing or tinkering with
the printer parts. (But hey, you are a maker and makers get
creative with the tools they need. If you have string or wire
tie-backs... use them.)
• Good WiFi access in your makerspace, so you can easily
access online tutorials and help on your laptop, desktop
computer, tablet, or smartphone, as needed.
Additional items for resin printing:
• Protective nonporous gloves (latex or nitrile). Either disposa-
ble or not, but the resin does not really ever dry, so those
gloves will need to be kept someplace where they will not get
resin on other things if you use nondisposable ones.
• A printing area away from direct sunlight, with good ventila-
tion to help mitigate the chemical smell of many resins.
198 Getting Started with 3D Printing

• A printing work area with an ambient temperature that is
around 70°F / 21°C to prevent resin from becoming too cold
or too hot (affects viscosity).
• A chisel and hammer to get tightly bonded prints off of the
print bed.
• Plastic container to wash your print off in isopropyl alcohol in
order to remove uncured resin from the surface. This could
be as simple as a plastic bag (running the risk of crushing
delicate prints, though), or a small plastic food container
that will be large enough for the maximum size of your print-
er's build area.
• 90% or above (the higher the better) isopropyl alcohol for
cleaning the prints. Denatured alcohol also works, but iso-
propyl alcohol is easier to find and relatively easier to work
with.
• Natural sunlight to post-cure the prints.
• In the absence of sunlight a container with some UV lights
installed. The UV lights need to be of the proper wavelength
to cure the specific resin you are using (see the resin curing
instructions from your resin manufacturer to find this out).
• One extra resin container for every type of resin you print
with. This is used to store the used resin so you do not con-
taminate the new resin with the used resin.
• A small strainer to strain the used resin from the build pro-
cess, mistakenly cured resin, as well as hair, dirt, etc.
• A supply of extra build vats/resin containers. For the major-
ity of resin printers, the resin vats are considered consuma-
ble, and have a finite lifespan, so having extra ones is a good
thing.
We realize that this is a long list of "things you should consider
having," but you probably own many of the items on this list
already, and many of the things you probably don't have are
commonly available (see Figure 12-7). In the beginning, get only
what you absolutely need and purchase new supplies and
equipment as you go. It may seem like a lot of prep work, but
creating a space in your home dedicated to creativity and explo-
ration can help provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment and is
worth the investment.

In the final chapter we will explore how 3D printing will change
your life by affecting your daily living, job, and access to technol-
ogy. Let's explore where this field is heading!
200 Getting Started with 3D Printing

PART IV
The Future


13/How 3D Printing
Will Change Your
(and Everyone Else's)
Life
In this book, you have learned how 3D printers work, how to set
up and use your own 3D printer, and how to create a personal
makerspace for 3D printing. You have also learned about some
of the third-party services that are available to handle aspects of
the 3D printing workflow for you. But the learning doesn't stop
here. You are an early adopter of this emerging technology, and
it will continue to grow and change rapidly in the coming months
and years.
For that reason, we urge you to engage with the 3D printing
community. There are many member-driven groups you can
join. One of the largest online groups for 3D printing is the Goo-
gle+ community for 3D printing, with over 200K members.
Figure 13-1 is a screen capture from the website. We recom-
mend that you find an online forum that suits your level and
interests, upload your 3D model creations to online repositories,
and attend 3D printing events in your community. It's a great
way to stay informed and up-to-date.
We don't have a crystal ball to see the future, but we do know
that 3D printing will increase in the coming years as more con-
tent is created, standards are defined, and the process of creat-
ing 3D models is made easier. 3D printing will change how we
make everything from pharmaceutical pills to hardware tools.
Here are some examples of what we think you can expect.
203

munity
We Are All Makers, and Companies
Will Foster That Even More
3D printing will eventually touch everyone's lives, and compa-
nies are starting to notice the potential. Consumers will all be
makers and companies are developing products, services, and
tools to help them participate even more in this technology.
Hardware stores in the future may not stock all items but rather
maintain CAD files of items (even ones that are no longer in pro-
duction) so you can print them at home or pick up 3D printed
copies at the store. You will even be able to modify it if you wish,
like the specialized wrench in Figure 13-2.
If your dishwasher breaks, you may be able to download the
CAD file for a replacement part via the manufacturers website
and 3D print it at home...even at 3 am when stores and repair
services are usually closed! This will save you the lengthy wait to
get the part delivered in the mail or you having to pick it up at
the store.
Companies know you want to save time and money. Companies
that offer downloadable CAD files as an option might also pro-
vide consumer installation instructions to limit unnecessary ser-
vice calls. If it's an easy install, consumers will be able to com-
plete the repair themselves.
204 Getting Started with 3D Printing

With 3D printing, you will no longer be bound to the set list of
possible choices offered by a manufacturer. You may become
the manufacturer yourself!
Figure 13-2. In the future, a tool manufacturer will let you down-
load the CAD file and 3D print it at home or at your local hard-
ware store
How 3D Printing Will Change Your (and Everyone Else's) Life 205

Companies Will Use 3D Printing to
Strengthen Their Connection with
You
3D printing offers organizations a unique branding opportunity.
Mass customization through 3D printing allows for the wide-
spread and relatively inexpensive manufacturing of one-off
objects. Brand managers know that most customers want prod-
ucts tailored to them. The ability to create something personal,
in partnership with their favorite brand, will strengthen brand
loyalty and make customers more involved than just passive
buyers.
In the future you will see more examples of branded "one-off"
gloves, hearing aids, hats, and more. It will be the new way to
monogram your purchases, with just the touch of a button, as
shown in Figure 13-3!
Figure 13-3. User-friendly interfaces will allow for mass customi-
zation of 3D printed goods over the Internet
Companies are motivated to acknowledge your unique needs,
interests, and tastes because doing so strengthens their con-
nection with you and increases sales. They will take your design
aesthetic and/or actual physical measurements into considera-
tion when they make your (literally your) item. Therefore, com-
petitors that don't offer you a 3D printed customized option
might come across as uncaring or unwilling to acknowledge
your preferences...and that never goes well for sales.
Companies will need to provide a very easy-to-understand user
interface when presenting their customers with so much choice
to minimize confusion. This combination of challenge and
206 Getting Started with 3D Printing

opportunity will certainly change the way companies offer
choices and promotional items to their customers in the near
future.
Textbook companies will undoubtedly adapt to this exciting new
technology, too. Imagine students being able to not only view
3D models online, but also to make these models take physical
form, as shown in Figure 13-4.
Figure 13-4. School textbooks will include 3D printable files as
part of the curriculum. Shown here is a 3D printed foot chosen by
the instructor for use in an anatomy class.
How 3D Printing Will Change Your (and Everyone Else's) Life 207

Organizations Will Increase
Profitability and Be More
Eco-Friendly
3D printing will offer all organizations (both profit and nonprofit)
other benefits than just generating brand loyalty and increased
sales. 3D printing will allow organizations to increase their prof-
itability and decrease their environmental footprint. Organiza-
tions will be able to make just what they need, as they need it,
without the waste normally associated with mass production.
Additionally, if a design flaw is found in a product, instant
changes can be made at much lower costs than would be the
case for retooling the entire production line.
3D printing drastically changes the supply chain by bringing
manufacturing closer to the end user and initiating the manu-
facturing of a product at the moment a customer wants to buy
it, not before. Environmentally conscious consumers will rejoice
in 3D printing's ability to produce one-offs that help control
inventory waste, reduce shipping distances, shorten lead times,
and minimize storage needs, as shown in Figure 13-5.
Organizations that stock more CAD files than physical items can
reduce the amount of wasted inventory that ends up as landfill
and, therefore, become more ecologically responsible. The dis-
tinction between shopping online and shopping at a brick-and-
mortar location may become less clear as your local garden
supply store, clothing store, or even pharmacy begins to include
CAD files in its inventory alongside the items on the shelves.
208 Getting Started with 3D Printing

sary or waiting to be sold
How 3D Printing Will Change Your (and Everyone Else's) Life 209

Local Economies Will Benefit from
the Commercial Use of 3D Printing
As we mentioned before, 3D printing will not replace mass pro-
duction but rather will integrate into current manufacturing
models. Specialized makers, potentially including you, will have
the ability to economically manufacture "low volume" produc-
tion runs ranging in numbers from 1 to 1,000 units.
With 3D printing, you will see products being made for hyper-
local markets like cities, towns, or even neighborhoods. This
hybrid model will help keep more revenue for local manufactur-
ing areas. In addition, local economies will also get the tax reve-
nues associated with the sales transactions.
There are organizations around the world that want to encour-
age an environment of local manufacturing. One such organiza-
tion is America Makes, a premier national accelerator for the 3D
printing industry that encourages the growth of US-based man-
ufacturing. A private/public initiative formed by the Obama
Administration in 2012. America Makes aims to bring back local
jobs and manufacturing to the USA through the application of
advanced additive manufacturing (another name for 3D print-
ing).
But job candidates will have to adapt. Local job seekers, wanting
local manufacturing jobs, will have to acquire new skills that pre-
pare them to work in this new manufacturing environment. Can-
didates entering this workforce will have more opportunities if
they are proficient in CAD modeling, 3D printing management,
and the related technologies.
210 Getting Started with 3D Printing

The Best Is Yet to Come
3D printing is already changing our lives financially, psychologi-
cally, socially, and creatively. As the industry and technologies
advance, 3D printing will continue to change our lives in ways we
can't even imagine.
Remember, this technology is still young and is expanding every
few months. 3D printing will continue to evolve and strengthen
as its ecosystem is deepened by new companies and new appli-
cations that emerge in this industry.
As you continue your journey into the world of 3D printing, keep
in mind that the most important application may have yet to be
discovered. Maybe it will be created by you!
