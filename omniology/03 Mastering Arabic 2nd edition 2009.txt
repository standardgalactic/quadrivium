Acknowledgements 
We are lucky enough to have benefited from the expertise and 
experience of some of the foremost experts in teaching Arabic across the 
two editions of Mastering Arabic. For their useful comments on this 
revised edition we would like to thank Nadia Adbulaal of the University 
of Manchester, Kassem Wahba of Georgetown University, Ghinwa 
Ma'mari and her team at the School of African and Oriental Studies, 
London University, and Osman Nusairi for his careful proofreading. For 
suggestions on the first edition, our thanks go to Dr Said Badawi of the 
American University in Cairo and Dr Avi Shivtiel of Leeds University. The 
course is immeasurably better for all of their input. 
We are also grateful to everyone at Palgrave Macmillan for their 
enthusiasm for this course, but specifically Dominic Knight, Helen Bugler 
and Isobel Munday who have supported us through both editions over 
two decades - a rare thing indeed in publishing these days. 
The authors and publishers wish to thank the following who have kindly 
given permission for the use of copyright material: Otto Harrassowitz 
Verlag for material from Hans Wehr, A Dictionary of Modern Arabic, 
ed. J. Milton Cowan, 1991. 
Every effort has been made to trace all the copyright holders but if any 
have been inadvertently overlooked the publishers will be pleased to 
make the necessary arrangement at the first opportunity. 

Preface to the second edition 
When we first set out to write this course there was very little material 
available that combined modern language teaching methods with 
learning Arabic. Mastering Arabic was our attempt to provide a friendly 
and fun introduction for the general learner, and we are gratified that it 
has proved popular with a wide range of students over the years. 
At the time of this second edition, the market for Arabic-teaching 
material has moved on and we have also learnt from our own subsequent 
experiences of teaching Arabic. We have tried to update and improve 
Mastering Arabic to keep it relevant and in the forefront, while not losing 
the essential elements that made it popular in the first place. 
What's new in the second edition? 
The second edition of Mastering Arabic has these additional features: 
• Clearer, more modern page design and layout 
• New 'Conversation' sections with accompanying audio, allowing 
learners to start talking right from the beginning 
• New 'Grammar index' for easy reference 
• More listening exercises to help with understanding spoken Arabic 
• Transliteration of examples and end-of-unit vocabulary lists 
throughout the course to help with pronunciation and reading 
• Some more advanced material moved to later units 
• Additional explanations to support individual learning 
• Individual amendments to take account of feedback received from 
both teachers and students of Arabic over the years. 
As publishers as well as educators by trade, we wrote in the first edition 
that the writing experience had left us 'feeling far more sympathetic 
towards authors than before we started'. As well as writing this second 
edition we have also painstakingly laid out the pages using the kind of 
computer publishing software only dreamt about at the time of the first 
edition. We now also feel far more sympathetic towards typesetters!

Introduction 
Arabic is spoken in over twenty countries, from North-West Africa to the 
Arabian Gulf. This makes it one of the most widely-used languages in the 
world, and yet it is often regarded as obscure and mysterious. This 
perception is more often based on an over-emphasis on the difficulty of 
the Arabic script and the traditional nature of some of the learning 
material than it is on the complexity of the language itself. There is 
certainly no reason why the non-specialist should not be able to acquire 
a general, all-round knowledge of Arabic, and enjoy doing so. 
Mastering Arabic will provide anyone working alone or within a group 
with a lively, clear and enjoyable introduction to Arabic. When you have 
mastered the basics of the language, then you can go on to study a 
particular area in more detail if you want. 
Before we go on to explain how to use this book, you should be 
introduced to the different kinds of Arabic that are written and spoken. 
These fall into three main categories: 
Modern Standard Arabic 
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the universal language of the Arab 
World, understood by all Arabic speakers. Almost all written material is in 
Modern Standard, as are formal and pan-Arab TV programmes, talks, etc. 
Classical Arabic 
This is the language of the Qur'an and classical literature. Its structure is 
similar to Modern Standard Arabic, but the style and much of the 
vocabulary is archaic. It is easier to begin by studying Modern Standard 
and then progress to classical texts, if that is what you wish to do. 
Colloquial dialects 
These are the spoken languages of the different regions of the Arab 
World. They are all more or less similar to the Modern Standard 
language. The colloquial dialects vary the most in everyday words and 
expressions, such as 'bread', 'how are you?', etc. 

xii 
Introduction 
We have chosen to teach the Modern Standard in Mastering Arabic as is it a 
good starting point for beginners. Modern Standard is universally under­
stood and is the best medium through which to master the Arabic script. 
However, whenever there are dialogues or situations where the colloquial 
language would naturally be used, we have tried to choose vocabulary 
and structures that are as close to the spoken form as possible. In this way, 
you will find that Mastering Arabic will enable you to understand Arabic in 
a variety of different situations and will act as an excellent base for 
expanding your knowledge of the written and spoken language. 
How to use Mastering Arabic 
This course has over two hours of accompanying audio and access to 
these recordings is essential, unless you are studying in a group where 
the tutor has the audio. Those parts of the book which are on the 
recording are marked with this symbol: ® 
We are assuming that when you start this book you know absolutely no 
Arabic at all and may be working by yourself. The individual units vary in 
how they present the material, but the most important thing to remember 
is to try not to skip anything (except perhaps the 'Structure notes' - see 
below). There are over 200 exercises in the book, carefully designed to help 
you practise what you have learnt and to prepare you for what is coming. 
Work your way through these as they appear in the book and you will find 
that the language starts to fall into place and that words and phrases are 
revised. Above all, be patient and do not be tempted to cut corners. 
Conversation sections 
These sections are designed to introduce you to basic conversational 
Arabic in social and everyday situations so that you can get talking right 
from the start. They appear in all the units in the first half of the course, 
and then as appropriate in the later units. 
Structure notes 
These occur at the end of some units and contain useful additional 
information about Arabic grammar. They are not essential to your 
understanding of basic Arabic but will be helpful to you in recognising 
some of the finer points when you read or hear them. 
Review units 
These occur at three points in the course. They will be very useful to you 
for assessing how well you remember what you have learnt. If you find 
you have problems with a particular exercise, go back and review the 
section or sections that deal with that area. 
So now you're ready to start learning with Mastering Arabic. We hope you 
enjoy the journey. 

Language units 

Getting 
started 
Letters of the alphabet: group 1 
Many Arabic letters can be grouped together according to their shapes. 
Some letters share exactly the same shape but have a different number 
of dots above or below; other shapes vary slightly. 
Look at this group of letters and listen to the recording: 
L J 
• 
:. 
'z J 
• 
U 
Name of letter 
Pronounced 
ba' 
'b' as in 'bat' 
ta' 
't' as in 'tap' 
tha' 
'th' as in 'thin' 
nOn 
'n' as in 'nab' 
ya' 
'y' as in 'yet' 
You can see that ba', ta' and tha' share the same shape, but the position 
and the number of dots are different; whereas nOn has a slightly 
different shape, more circular and falling below the line, and ya' has a 
much curlier shape (but is connected with the other letters, as you will 
see later in Unit 1). 
2 

Getting started 
When Arabic is written by hand, the dots often become 'joined' for the 
sake of speed. Compare the printed and the handwritten letters below. 
The most common Arabic printed style is called naskh, and the most 
common handwriting style riq'a.

4 
Unit 1 
• Handwriting practice 
(When practising handwriting, first trace the letters following the direction 
of the arrows, and then try writing them on lined paper.) 
The Arabic script is written from right to left, so the letters should be 
formed starting from the right: 
ba', ta', thai 
nOn 
ya' 
It's easier to finish the main shape first and then add the dots: 
ba' 
ta' 
tha' 
• 
nOn 
V 
ya' 
Tip: There are no capital letters in Arabic.

Getting started 
Vowels 
Arabic script is similar to SMS messages in that both types of writing 
leave out many of the vowels. The short vowels in Arabic are written 
above and below the letters. If you read the Arabic press or 
pick up a novel you will rarely see these vowels, as they are not usually 
written. The reader is expected to deduce the meaning of the word 
from its pattern and the context. 
This book will begin by showing all the short vowels and will 
gradually drop them as you become more proficient. 
. ' 
Look at these letters and listen to the recording: 
 
.Yo 
U (ba) 
U (bi) 
U 
(bu) 
• 
/ . 
• 
From this you can see: 
- A dash above the letter (..:.) is pronounced as a short 'a' following the 
letter. This vowel is called fat:a. 
- A dash below the letter (-:;-) is pronounced as a short 'i' following the 
letter. This vowel is called kasra. 
, 
- A comma shape above the letter (_) is pronounced as a short 'u' 
following the letter. This vowel is called 9amma. 
Ȱ Exercise 2 
Listen to the recording and write the correct vowels on these letters:

answers in the answer section.

Unit 7 
Joining letters: group 1 
Written Arabic is 'joined up'. When letters come at the end of a word 
they look very much as they do when standing alone. However, when 
they come at the beginning or in the middle of a word they get 
'shortened'. 
Look at how these letters combine: 
...- (read from right to left) 
ᅞ - ᅟ + U 
. 
.. 
u.J 
u + h 
:. 
+ 
+ 
:. 
U+-t - h 
U 
U 
. 
Notice how the letter gets 'chopped' and loses its final flourish, or 
'tail', when at the beginning or in the middle of a word, but still keeps its 
dots for recognition. 
The letters nOn and ya' have exactly the same shape as the other 
letters in this group when they come at the beginning or in the middle of 
a word, but they retain their differences when at the end: 
0-! = u +  u 
. 
. 
੧ 
,/ + U 
u.u 
h + '/ + u 
.. . 
. 
i + U + 
੦ 
u 
.. 
611 
ᅟ + U + i 
.. 

Getting started 
.. Handwriting practice 
Notice how these letters are joined when written by hand: 
ȭ -
:. 
U + U 
• 
()-! 
- u +  u

6 
'-
"
, 
u+ u + 
• 
• 
4J*! 
+ . + 
'I 
u 
U 
1/1 
It's easiest if you complete the main shape of the word and then go 
back to the right-hand side and add all the dots from right to left. 
Exercise 4 
Look at the newspaper headline. Two examples of the letters in group 1 
are circled. How many others can you find? 
Tip: When ya' is by itself or at the end of a word, you may see it without 
the two dots.

Unit 1 
Exercise 5 
Write out these combinations of letters. The first is an example: 
• 
.. 
\,)1.J - 0+ '1 + ᅝ 1 
.. 
'1+ 0 2 
- 0+ u + ᅝ 3 
ᅝ+ u + 0 4 
'1+ 0+ u + 'I 
5 
- t.S + ᅝ+ t.S + U 
6 
.. 
.. 
Adding vowels to words 
We can now add vowels to the combinations of letters to make words: 
.. 
(tub) u.J 
 
(b) u + (tu) ᅝ 
. 
(bin) ᅛ - (n) 0 + (bi) Ɂ 
o 
(bint) ੥ 
(t) ᅝ + (n) 0 + (bi) Ɂ 
 
0  
(bayna) ᅜ= (na) 0 + (y) t.S + (ba) ɂ 
.. 
SukOn 
If there is a small circle (sukun) above a letter (..:.) this indicates that no 
vowel sound follows that letter - see bint and bayna above. Notice how 
the sukun is not usually put above the last letter of a word. 

Getting started 
ȫ Exercise 6 
Listen to the recording and write the vowels on these words. Each word 
will be given twice. 
:. 
U+i 
4 
ᅘ 
1 
:. 
.. 
:. 
u-L:! 
5 
U'! · 
2 
. 
੡ 
6 
੤ 3 
Shadda 
9 
In addition to the three short vowels and the sukOn, there is another 
symbol: the shadda. This is a small w shape (..:.) written above the letter to 
show that it is doubled. For example: 
'" 
(bathth) ੣ = (th) 6 + (th) 6 + (ba) U 
'" .. 
.. 
. 
(bunn) 0-! - (n) 0 + (n) 0 + (bu) U 
The sound of a letter is lengthened when there is a shadda. Take care to 
pronounce this, otherwise you may change the meaning of the word. 
੢ 
Listen to these examples and repeat them with the recording. Each 
'I example is given twice: 
'" ..

the letter itself - see example 5.

Conversation sections 
These sections are designed to introduce you to basic conversational 
Arabic in social and everyday situations. They appear in all the units in 
the first half of the course, and then as appropriate in the later units. 
You'll find the conversational phrases on the recording, and you'll also 
be given the opportunity to take part in short dialogues with native 
speakers. Concentrate on speaking and listening in these sections. At 
first you may not be able to read all the Arabic script, but you will be 
able to recognise some of the letters and words.

_ g Conversation -- 
Greetings 
One of the most important conversational skills initially in any language 
is to know how to greet people. Arabic greetings can be elaborate and 
prolonged, but some all-purpose expressions will get you by: 
ᅓi (ahlan) Hello 
'f1J. / d; ᅓi (ahlan bik/biki) Hello to you (talking to a male/female) 
ɣI c: t..;..:, (3aba: al-khayr) Good morning

Unit 1 
Vocabulary learning 
Arabic presents some challenges to the beginner trying to learn 
vocabulary, as the words and the script are unfamiliar. However, you 
can use strategies to help you. One method recommended for learning 
vocabulary in new scripts is the use of flashcards, similar to the method 
used to teach young children how to read. 
Try the following method to learn your vocabulary: 
• Make a set of small cards, blank on both sides. 
• Get five envelopes and mark them 'Day I', 'Day 2', etc. 
• Write each Arabic word, with vowels, on one side of a card and the 
English on the other: 
This is good handwriting practice and will also help you remember 
the word. 
• Put all the cards in the envelope marked 'Day I'. 
• Each day, take the cards out of each envelope in turn starting with 
the highest-numbered envelope and working down to 'Day I'. (The 
first day you'll only have cards in the 'Day I' envelope, the next day 
you'll have 'Day 2' and 'Day I', and so on until you have completed 
five days.) 
• Put each card Arabic side up and say the Arabic aloud. Try to 
remember what it means. When you've finished, shuffle the cards 
and put them English side up, repeating the process. 
• If you remember a word, it progresses to the next envelope; if you 
forget, it goes back to Day 1:  
FORGET 
REMEMBER 
• If you can remember a word five days running you can throw the 
card away. (Or you can put it back in the Day 1 envelope without the 
vowels.) You can add up to 15 words a day to the Day 1 envelope.

Letters of the alphabet: group 2 
Look at the next group of letters and listen to the recording: 
Name of letter 
Pronounced 
L 
alit 
(see pages 17 and 20) 
Ȩ 
dal 
'd' as in 'dad' 
• 
ਗ਼ 
dhal 
'th' as in 'that' 
ȧ 
ra' 
rolled 'r' as in Spanish 'arriva' 
• 
:J 
lay 
'z' as in 'zone' 
:J-
waw 
'w' as in 'wet' 
You can see that the dal and dhal have the same basic shape, as do ra' 
and lay. The only difference is that dhal and lay have the dot over the 
basic shape. Pay special attention to the position and shape of these four 
letters - dal and dhal sit on the line while ra' and lay fall under the line. 
13 

1 4  
Unit 2 
Waw and alif have very distinctive shapes, but their connection with 
the other letters in this group will become clear later in this unit. 
As there are no dots to 'join up' in this group of letters, the 
handwritten versions tend to look very similar to the printed versions. 
Exercise 1 
Draw a line between the printed letters, their handwritten versions and 
the names of the letters, as in the example: 
alif 
I 
dal

zay 
•

dal, dhal 
ra', lay 
waw 
alif 
Remember, finish the shape first and then add any dots: 
I 
Joining letters: group 2 
The similarity between the letters in group 2 becomes clear when we look 
at how they are joined to other letters. All of the six letters in this group 
are joined to the letter before but cannot be joined to the letter after. Look 
at how alif joins in these combinations: 
w-
+ u  
ul - u + 
u4 - u + 1 +  u 

7 6  
Unit 2 
All the letters in this group have the same basic shape wherever they 
appear in a word, and always have a space after them because they do not 
join to the next letter. 
Jᄵ = J + J + ɂ 
Uo:!j = u + '! + j 
IJ,.JI = I + J + u + I 
. 
. 
The letters in group 2 are the only letters which cannot be joined to the 
letter following in a word. All other letters can be joined on either side. 
II> Handwriting practice 
Practise copying these words. Remember to write the whole word and 
then add the dots. 
Exercise 2 
Fill in the missing letters or words to match the example:

Long vowels 
In Unit 1 you met the three Arabic vowel signs: fat:a (a), kasra (i) and 
<;lamma (u). These are all pronounced as short vowels. They can be made 
long by adding the three letters alif (I), ya' (<f) and waw G). 
i) Look at the following and listen to the recording: 
L (ba) 
II! 
U 
. 
. 
੕ (bT) 
II! 
U 
y. 
y. 
,j-! (bO) 
II! 
U 
. 
From this you should be able to see that: 
fat:a + alif = a (long 'a' as in hair or as in heart) 
kasra + ya' = T (long 'i' as in meet) 
<;lamma + waw = 0 (long 'u' as in boot) 
(ba) 
(bi) 
(bu) 
Tip: In practice, the vowel signs are rarely written on long vowels as the 
extra letter already indicates the sound: ঠ .Y.  

1 8  
Unit 2 
Now listen to the pairs of words and repeat them after the recording. 
Listen carefully for the difference in the short and long vowels. Each pair 
is given twice:

(All of these words exist!) The answer is that you do not know automatically. 
However, when you have learned more about the structure and vocabulary 
patterns in Arabic, you will usually be able to tell from the context.

Unit 2 
Alif 
Alif is unique amongst Arabic letters because it does not have a definite 
sound. There are two main ways an alif is used: 
1 To form the long vowel a (see page 17). 
2 To 'carry' a short vowel. If a word begins with a short vowel, the vowel 
sign cannot simply hang in the air before the next letter. So the vowel 
sign is placed above or under an alif, as in these examples: 
(in) 01 
 
Վ 
(udh) jl 
ظ 
(ab) ul 
. 
The small 'c' shape (y) that accompanies the vowel sign is known as 
hamza. (For more details about hamza, see Unit 6, page 76.) 
ɦ Listen carefully to these words which begin with a vowel carried by 
W analif.

Introductions 
You learnt a few popular greetings in Unit 1 ,  so now you're ready to 
introduce yourself. The simplest way to say your name is to use the 
phrase you've learnt in this unit: ana ... (I'm ... ). You could then ask 
how someone is, or say you're pleased to meet him or her. 
Listen to these conversations on your recording and then have a go at 
introducing yourself.

'ch' as in Scottish 'loch' 
ha' 
'h' as in 'house' 
mTm 
'm' as in 'mastering' 
* Also pronounced 'g' as in 'gate' in parts of Egypt. 
There is an obvious similarity between the first three letters - jTm, kha' and 
¨a'. The main letter has exactly the same basic shape: only the position of 
the dots will tell you which one it is. 
The ha' and the mTm do not share their shapes with any other letters, 
but are included here for pronunciation and vocabulary reasons. 
The pronunciation of ¨a' and kha' may be unfamiliar sounds to your 
25

ear. kha' is a sound similar to that made when clearing your throat. 
:a' is a breathy 'h' sometimes confused with ha' by beginners, so we will 
take extra care in showing you how to distinguish the two sounds.

Unit 3 
Feminine words 
You have already seen that there are two genders in Arabic. All nouns 
(people, objects, ideas, etc.) are either masculine (male) or feminine 
(female). Luckily it is fairly easy to tell which gender a particular word is. 
There is a special feminine ending that is a 'bundled up' Ui' (..:,): ii. 
This is called ta' marbOěa (literally tied up ta'). When the word is said by 
itself, the ta' marbOěa is not usually pronounced: 
ᄲ ছ (madTna) city 
.. 
4 JJ (zawja) wife 
There are two main categories of words which are feminine: 
1 Female people or words that refer to females (girl, mother, etc.). 
Most countries are also considered female. 
2 Singular words that end in ta' marbOěa. (There are a few exceptions to 
this, but they are rare.) 
A word could fall into both categories, e.g. Ɣ".) (zawja) wife. 
There are a small number of feminine words that do not fall into either 
of these categories, often words connected with the natural world (wind, 
fire, etc.) or parts of the body (hand, leg, etc.). However, in general you 
can presume a word is masculine unless it falls into one of the two 
categories above. 
ɠ Exercise 4

Letters of the alphabet: group 4 
Listen to the recording, paying special attention to the pronunciation of 
the second pair of letters: 
Name of letter 
Pronounced 
sTn 
IS' as in 'sea' 
shTn 
Ish' as in 'sheet' 
strong, emphatic 's' 
strong, emphatic 'd' 
You can see that the letters sTn and shTn have the same basic shape, but 
shTn has three dots above. shTn and tha' are the only two letters in the 
Arabic alphabet that have three dots. Farsi (the language of Iran) has 
other letters with three dots above and below, and these are occasionally 
used for sounds that do not exist in Arabic (for example, p and v). 
Ĉad and <;lad have the same basic shape, but <;lad has one dot above. 
All the letters in group 4 have a Similarly shaped tail. 
Notice that when Arabic is written in English letters (transliterated), a 
dot is put under such letters as Ĉad, <;lad and ¨a' to distinguish them from 
their more familiar equivalents.

You can see that the handwritten letters look similar to the printed 
versions except that the three dots on shTn have become joined, as they 
did with tha' (..;.,). The 'w' shape at the beginning of sTn and shTn can also 
become 'smoothed out' in handwriting, like this: c.r-
c.:r!- .  
However, as a beginner, it's easier to stick to the more standard versions.

 Joining letters: group 4 
39 
All of the letters in group 4 work on the same principle as the other letters 
which have tails (e.g., r and 1"). The tail falling below the line gets 
'chopped' when the letters are joined to another following. Only when they 
are standing by themselves or at the end of a word do they keep their tails.

Unit 4 
åad and <;iad are emphatic letters and have no direct equivalent in 
English. The difference in the pronounciation of sTn and åad is similar to 
the difference between the initial sounds of the English words 'ˀit' and 
'ˁorry'; and dal and <;iad similar to the difference between 'gin' and 'got'. 
It is important to try to distinguish between emphatic and non-emphatic 
letters, as it is between ha' Co) and ¨a' Cc). Listen to these pairs of words

masculine singular + On = masculine plural 
masculine singular + at = feminine plural 
These plurals are known as the sound masculine plural and the sound 
feminine plural ('sound' here means 'complete' and does not refer to the 
pronunciation). All the jobs in this chapter can be made plural by 
adding the endings shown above. 
Notice that although there is only one word for 'we', u.=-:. (na:nu), the 
word for 'they' is r" (hum) for the masculine plural and ᄚ (hunna) for 
the feminine plural: 
.,. 
oUᄛ j..l.4 ੃ (hum mudarrisOn) They are (male) teachers. 
'" 
ouLw j..l.4 UA (hunna mudarrisat) They are (female) teachers. 
The feminine plural is not as common as the masculine plural as all 
members of a group must be female for it to be used. If the group is 
mixed, the masculine is always used. (Spoken dialects often use the 
masculine plural only whatever the gender of the group.)

Look again at the words listed in Exercise 3. Write the masculine and 
feminine plurals for these words.

_ " Conversation 
Talking about what you do 
If you want to ask someone what they do for a living you can ask: 
ġƗ lo (ma tamalak/-ik?) What's your job? (to a man/woman) 
.ᄖᄗ / U"ᄘᄙ L.:.i (ana mudarris/mumarriQa) I'm a teacher/a nurse. 
tamal means 'work' or 'job' and the ending -ak or -ik means 'your' (-ka 
and -ki in more formal Arabic). You could also ask where someone works: 
ġƗ 0-:!i (ayna tamalak/-ik?) Where's your job? 
'C>J..>:H .; / uক .; (fT lundun/fT bayrOt) In London/In Beirut. 
If you're studying at university or school you may want to say: 
.ᅑl.1. / ᅒl.1. L.:.i (ana talib/taliba) I'm a student (male/female) . 
. +, / , L.:.i (ana tilmTdh/tilmTdha) I'm a pupil (male/female). 
A good expression to express interest or admiration is: 
!Ull ̎L.:. lo (ma sha'a allah) Wonderful! 
Listen to the conversation and then take one of the roles yourself. 

48 
Unit 4 
Structure notes 
The structure note sections are intended to give more details about 
the structure of the Arabic language. They wil be useful mainly for 
recognition purposes and should not be slavishly learnt. If you require 
a more general understanding of Arabic, you can quickly skim 
through these sections or even skip them altogether. 
Case endings 
Arabic nouns and adjectives have case endings - grammatical endings 
that can be added to the end of nouns. However, unlike many 
languages, for example German, these endings are rarely pronounced 
and for practical purposes do not exist in spoken dialects. So learners 
of Arabic (and native speakers) can get by without a detailed 
knowledge of these endings. 
The sort of situations in which you are likely to meet the full endings 
are readings of classical literature (particularly the Qur'an), and more 
formal radio and TV broadcasts, especially if the speaker wishes to 
show his or her 'grammatical correctness'. You will rarely find them 
written in modern newspapers or literature. 
Having said that, there are some occasions in Modern Standard Arabic 
when the endings affect the spelling and pronounciation and so some 
knowledge of how they work is desirable. 
The nominative case (ar-raft) 
There are three cases. The first is the nominative. The easiest way to 
explain this case is to say that you can assume a noun is nominative 
unless there is a reason for it not to be. Almost all of the nouns you 
have met in the book so far have been in the nominative case. 
If we take the noun ğ (bint), girl/daughter, and add the full ending 
for the nominative case we have: 
ᄔ (pronounced 'bintun') 
oJ 
The ending (_ ) is written above the final letter like the vowels, and is 
pronounced 'un'. So the sentence ৥ Il.\ (hadha bayt), This is a 
house, would be ᄕ Il.\ (hadha bay tun) if fully pronounced. 
Look at these other nouns you know with their full endings: 
)Ș (najjarun) carpenter 
ੁ4-ੂ (zujajatun*) bottle 
.. 
ti ... " 
..:,L..:.̌ (mumarri<;latun*) nurses 

jobs 
* the ta' marbOta is pronounced 'at' when a case ending is added to 
the noun. 
The sound masculine plural is an exception and has a different 
ending: 
.. 
'it .. ѿ 
uY"-'.).u> (mudarrisOn(a) 
Here, the whole of the part underlined can be considered as the 
nominative case ending, but only the final 'a' is not usually 
pronounced in Modern Standard Arabic. 
Optional exercise 
Go back to Exercise 3 and say the sentences again, this time 
pronouncing the full endings on the words.

The fa' and qat have similar shapes, but the tail of the qat is rounder and 
falls below the line (a little like the difference between ,,:, and u)' 
The tail of the lam must also fall below the line and not sit on it like an 
English 'I'. Both lam and kat have distinctive shapes which are not shared 
with any other letter. 
Pronunciation of qat 
It takes practice to pronounce qat properly. You should soy a 'q' from the 
back of your throat. In Modern Standard Arabic, care must be taken to 
distinguish the pronunciation of kat and qat (listen again to the recording). 
However, spoken dialects tend to pronounce the qat either as a 'g' as 
50 

Describing things

in 'gate' or as a glottal stop. (A glottal stop is the sort of sound produced 
when you pronounce 'bottle' with a Cockney accent, or in 'Estuary 
English', dropping the 'tt'.) This book will pronounce the qat in the 
classical way, but be prepared to hear the same words pronounced with 
a 'g' or a glottal stop by native speakers.

*Tip: In spoken dialects these endings are usually simplified to -ak, -ik and -uh: 
kitabgk, kitabils, kitabuh. 
These endings are known as attached pronouns since they are 'attached' 
to the end of the word. Remember that when you add an ending to a

Exercise 9 
Try to describe some of your possessions, using the sentences you 
produced in Exercise 8 as models. 
Structure notes 
Indefinite and definite 
When you add JI (ai, the) to an indefinite noun, you make it definite. 
The case ending you met in Unit 4 changes slightly: 
.. ğ (bintun) a girl/daughter (indefinite) 
ਫ਼I (al-bintlJ) the girl/daughter (definite) 
The indefinite case ending -un becomes -u when the noun is definite. 
Nouns which have possessive endings are also definite, and this 
accounts for the 'u' which appears before the attached pronouns: 
;'I;"! (bintlJka) your (masculine) daughter 
, 
:'I;',! (bintlJki) your (feminine) daughter 
ჰ (bintlJhu) his daughter 
ჱ (bintlJha) her daughter 
But notice that when you add ,:? (i, my), the case ending is not included. 
Look at these sentences you have met in this unit with the full case 
endings added. Notice that the adjectives as well as the nouns carry 
the case endings.

IJ Letters of the alphabet: group 6 
ყ
.. 
This is the final group of letters. All of these sounds are less familiar to a 
ღ Western ear, so listen carefully to the recording: 
Name of letter 
Pronounced 
Strong, emphatic 't' 
Strong, emphatic 'z' 
Guttural 'ah' (see below) 
ghayn 
a gargling sound similar to a 
French 'r' 
You can see that the ta' and ?a' share the same basic shape, and tayn 
and ghayn also share the same basic shape. A single dot distinguishes 
each pair. 
Emphatic letters 
Altogether there are four emphatic letters which you should take care to 
distinguish from their non-emphatic equivalents. Listen to the recording 
and repeat the letters in the table on page 66.

Remember that when Arabic is written in English letters (transliterated), 
a dot is put under the emphatic letter to distinguish it.

Now check your answers and repeat the words after the recording. 
ghayn and tayn 
These two letters, especially tayn, represent unfamiliar sounds and take 
practice to pronounce. However, you will develop a feel for them and will 
gradually find them easier to say and recognise. 
- ghayn (0 is pronounced like the French 'gr' as in 'gratin', and is 
similar to the noise you make when you gargle. 

Where is it? 
67 
- tayn (t) is produced by tightening your throat and making an 'ah' 
sound by pushing out air from your lungs - easier said than done! 
Imagine you are at the dentist and the drill touches a nerve. Beginners 
often fail to hear tayn as a letter at all, but to native speakers it is no 
different from any other letter and leaving it out could lead to blank 
looks. tayn does not have a near equivalent in English and so the 
Arabic letter itself is used in the transliteration. 
Repeat the six words that you hear on the recording. They all contain the 
.' 
letter ghayn. 
Now repeat the next six words, which all contain the letter tayn. 
, Exercise 2 
Listen to the eight words on the recording. Decide if the word begins with 
a tayn or not. The first is an example. Each word is repeated.

W and Ĝa' are formed a bit like 3ad and <;lad, except there is no 
'kink' after the loop: 
- joined only to the letter after: 
... J, 
- joined on both sides: 
... .k. .. . 
- joined only to the letter before: 
ë .. . 
The downwards stroke and dot are usually added after the whole 
shape of the word is complete: 
stage 7: 
stage 2: 
Practise copying these words: 
tayn and ghayn 
Like ha' (.:.), these two letters change their shapes depending on where 
they appear in a word. 
- JOined only to the following letter they look like this: ... ة (like the 
isolated version without its tail) 
- Joined on both sides they look like this: ... ..£. ... 
- Joined only to the letter before they look like this: r:-... 
Look carefully at how these letters combine:

* = J + '1 + t 
უJ-4 = J + t+ j + !

Notice especially that tayn and ghayn each look very different at the 
end of a word, depending on whether or not they are joined to the 
previous letter (see the fourth and fifth examples above).

v--;-; 
'-' 
.. 
l 
. FJ.:!J..?o F ..)ਫ' (as-sayyara jadTda) The car is new. 
Notice that ʸI is pronounced ill-qamTĈ, but ჻.>4,.J1 is pronounced 
as-sayyara. This is because when JI (al-, the) is added to words beginning 
with particular letters, the lam is pronounced like the first letter of that 
word and not as a lam. The letter 'takes over' (assimilates) the 'I' sound of 
the lam. When this assimilation happens, the first letter of the word 
sounds as though it is pronounced twice: aŷ-ŷayyara. 
Letters like sTn, which assimilate the lam of al-, are known as 'sun 
letters' since the Arabic word shams,'sun', starts with shTn - one of the 
assimilating letters. The others are 'moon letters'. All sun letters are 
pronounced with your tongue at the top of your mouth, just behind your 
teeth. This is the same position as lam. Half the letters of the alphabet 
are sun letters. All of the letters in group 4 (sTn, shTn, Ĉad and <;lad) are sun 
letters, and none of the letters in group 3 (jim, ¨a',kha', mTm and ha').

Yes/no questions 
You can form a question in Arabic to which the answer is either 'yes' 
(৓, natm) or 'no' (':/, la) by adding the question marker JA (hal) in 
front of a sentence: 
.. ਛ IJ (hadha nahr) This is a river. 
R* IJ JA (hal hadha nahr) Is this a river? 
.ɝ j)J (hadhihi bintuha) This is her daughter.

Hamza 
The hamza shape thʹt you have seen sitting on an alit in words such as Bi 
(umm, mother) or ",:-,1 (ab, father) can also be found written in other 
ways. One of these is on a ya' letter shape with no dots, as in ii..wlo 
(ma'ida, table). Hamza is pronounced as a short pause when it falls in the 
middle of a word. There are detailed rules concerning how to write 
hamza, but it is best at first to learn each word as it appears.

Keying Arabic 
Keying Arabic is much simpler than handwriting in that the computer 
automatically joins the letters. An Arabic keyboard will show mainly 
separate letters (ჾ J (. , etc.). All you need to do is key the individual 
letters in a word and the computer will figure out how to join them. 
The previous character is altered, depending on the next one keyed. For 
example, the word ʺ, bag, is five keystrokes. As you key each 
character, you will see the one before alter to the correct form: 
keystroke 1: r 
-+ screen 1: 
r 
keystroke 2: ñ 
-+ screen 2: 
৐ 
keystroke 3: t./ 
-+ screen 3: 
ਕ 
keystroke 4: 
u 
-+ screen 4: 
ৎ 
. 
ѽ 
keystroke 5: 
I> 
-+ screen 5: 
আ 
When you key a space, the computer knows that this word is finished 
and the process begins again with the next word. 
Dialects 
--1 
_ g Conversation 
So far you have met some simple Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) phrases 
for greetings, for introducing yourself and your family, and for asking for 
things. These phrases will be understood throughout the Arab world. 
However, spoken dialects will vary from one region to another. 
MSA is the foundation that underpins all these dialects, and through MSA 
you will understand the principles that guide the Arabic language. 
However, there are some variations for basic words used in dialect and 
it is worth recognising the most common. Two of these are the 
question words 'what?' and 'where?' 
What's your name? 
Where's the door?

Structure notes 
The genitive case 
Unit 6 
Nouns that follow positional words, such as ა (in) or ȹ (on), are in 
the genitive case. This case is formed in a similar way to the 
nominative (see Unit 4), but using kasra, not <;lamma: 
Indefinite

So the sentence ...

Ⴥ.1.0 :.)਍ (3Qrat madrna) picture of a town 
83 
t1.)4.-l1 Ⴜ (ma3nat as-sayyarat) car factory ('factory of the cars') 
Putting two or more nouns directly together in this way is known as idafa 
('addition'). You have also met examples of i<;lafa in Units 3 and 4: Ⴡi ̍ 
(bint a:mad), Ahmad's daughter; .l..,J1 ƒ (TaqTbat al-walad), the boy's 
bag. Arabic uses i<;lafa to describe a close relationship, where English might 
use a possessive '5, of ('a bottle of water') or a compound ('clothes store'). 

84 
Unit 7 
The ta' marbOta is always pronounced on the first noun in an i<;lafa. 
Only the last noun in an i<;lafa can have al- (the). Whether or not the last 
noun has al- depends on the meaning. Look at the examples below: 
,-"..)..1-0  (bayt mudarris) a teacher's house 
,-",P..I.Al1  (bayt al-mudarris) the teacher's house 
, 
ঀ ༖ ༗..) (zujajat ta3Tr) a bottle of juice 
, 
༘ I ༖ ༗..) (zujajat al-ta3Tr) the bottle of juice 
An i<;lafa can consist of more than two nouns: 
U'"'P..I.Al1  ᅈᅇ (bab bayt al-mudarris) the door of the 
teacher's house 
l 
U.1fll Ⴛj U-?I (ibn amTr al-kuwayt) the son of the Emir of Kuwait

Group words 
Some words have a plural meaning, even though they are grammatically 
singular. For example: 
® (shajar) trees 
Ⴖ ɘJ (dajaj) poultry (hens) 
These words are group words (collective nouns). Most of these words refer 
to plants or animals that are naturally found together in groups. If a ta' 
marbOta is added to the word, then it refers to only one of the group . 
® (shajar) trees 
Ⴖ ɘJ (dajaj) poultry (hens) 
.; ® (shajara) a tree 
਄,-?-J (dajaja) a hen 
group word + .; 
= one of group 
Ⴕ Exercise 4 
Here are some more collective nouns. Listen to the words and then make 
them refer to just one of the group, as in the example.

6 ȉ (battikh) water melons 

86 
Unit 7 
More about plurals 
You have seen in Unit 4 how many words which refer to people can be 
made plural by adding certain endings. Remind yourself of the singular 
and plural for 'teacher':

The sound masculine plural (-On) is only used as a plural for words 
referring to male people. The sound feminine plural (-at) is used as a 
plural for words referring to female people, and also as the plural of a 
number of other words which are not people (and which may be 
masculine or feminine in the singular). Here are some words you already 
know that can be made plural using the sound feminine plural: 
Singular 
car 
:,) I (sayyara) 
bicycle 
KI,)J (darraja) 
television 
u,y.j go! Ii (tiITfizyOn) 
Plural
¡ :l 
ul,)I (sayyarat) 
u4-IJJ (darrajat) 
uL:,.>:!Ⴔ (tilTfizyOnat) 
Notice that you must remove the ta' marbOta before adding the sound 
feminine plural (-at). There are no rules to tell you which words can be 
made plural using the sound feminine plural, but many long words and 
words derived from other languages (for example, tilTfizyOn) can be 
made plural by adding this ending. 
More about adjectives 
In the description of the town you met this sentence: 
, , 
.Ⴓj J!j Ⴑ dUA 4' ৉ Ⴒ 
On the right of the bank, there's a black and ugly factory. 
Notice that the two adjectives come after the noun (and not before, as they 
would in English). The use of..J (wa, and) to separate the adjectives is 
optional. If you are referring to a specific factory, then you must add JI 
(ai, the) to the adjectives as well as the noun: 

Describing places 
(masnat aswad qab1J:1) 
Q black ugly factory 
ਆI JY'" uI c.. .. , ... JI (al-masnat al-aswad al-qab1J:1) 
the black ugly factory 
You also add JI to the adjective if the noun has a possessive ending: 
(TaqTbatT al-jadTda) my new bag 
(kalbuhu al-abyac,i ath-thaqil) 
his white heavy dog 
87 
l 
The presence and position of JI can change the meaning, and you must 
take care where you place it when describing things: 
.Ⴍ əI 
(al-bint jamTla.) The girl is beautiful. 
ਇI əI (al-bint al-jamil) the beautiful girl 
Ⴍ ৆ 
(bint jamila) a beautiful girl

Many Arabic names for countries are similar to the English. Names of 
foreign countries often end in a long a sound. You will find that you will 
become better at picking out these foreign names as you become more

country (mi3r) + (Ty) 
nationality (mi3rTy) 
Nisba adjective 
Adjectives describing nationality are made by adding -Ty to the noun, in 
this case the country. This ending has come into English through words 
adopted from Arabic, such as Kuwait!, Saudi, Oman!, Yemen!, etc. 
The -Ty adjectival ending is known as ʻ (nisba). Nisba is used to 
describe nationality, but is also commonly employed to make many 
other nouns into adjectives, for example turning ؞ (bayt), house, into 
ၠ (baytly), domestic, or Jၣ (shamal), north, into Jၣ (shamaITy), 
northern. Nisba adjectives are a very useful way of expanding your 
vocabulary quite easily. 
There are a few things to remember when adding the nisba ending: 
1 If the noun ends in ta' marbuta (+), a or ya, you need to remove this 
before adding the nisba ending: 
l:!.)Y-" (suriya) Syria 
ၦ 
ၧ')Y-" (surTy) Syrian 
ၤ.>'"i (amrTka) America ၦ 
ၥ->"i (amrTkTy) American 
W (libya) Libya 
ၦ 
ၨ (llbTy) Libyan 
4-0 (mihna) profession ၦ 
ၩ (mihnTy) professional 
ၡ,J-O (musTka) music ၦ 
ၢ,J-O (musTk1) musical 
2 If a country starts with al-, remove this before adding the nisba ending: 
ul..l.y.J1 (as-sudan) Sudan ၦ 
u4J1 (al-yaban) Japan ၦ 
JI..lY-" (sudan1) Sudanese 
Jl:! (yaban1) Japanese 
3 One nationality is unusual. Take a special note of it: 
IၪI (injiltara) England ၦ

Unit 9 
Plural of nisba 
As with many of the jobs you met in Unit 4, nationalities and other nisba 
adjectives can generally be made feminine by adding ta' marbOta, and 
plural by using the sound masculine plural (-On) or the sound feminine 
plural (-at): 
Mase. sing. 
Fern. sing.

Arabic numbers 1-10 
European languages adopted Arabic numerals in the Middle Ages to 
replace the very clumsy Roman numerals. Although Arabic and English 
figures are basically the same numbers, the shape varies somewhat. 
Compare the Arabic figures 1 to 10 with their English equivalents.

One unusual feature of Arabic numbers is that they are written from left 
to right, the same direction as English numbers. (Look at the Arabic ' • 
and the English 10.) This is the opposite direction to the rest of the Arabic 
script. You may see Arabs writing numbers backwards (as if you wrote 
12387 starting with the 7 and finishing with the 1). However, writing 
numbers backwards is a difficult art to master and it is common to leave 
a space and start the numbers from the left:

Handwritten numbers 
Most Arabic handwritten numbers look similar to the printed ones. 
1 7 7 
The main difference is that the r (2) is usually handwritten as ॸ (see the 
'Handwriting practice' panel). 
Tip: Watch out for the handwritten r (3). Sometimes the wavy shape at 
the top becomes smoothed out for the sake of speed, making it look 
more like a printed r .  Remember this, especially when reading 
handwritten prices.

Practise writing the numbers, starting at the dot. 
Now write out these numbers by hand: 57, 1 02, 956, 340, 788.

Unit 7 0  
English words in Arabic 
If English took its numbers from Arabic, then Arabic has taken quite a few 
words in return. For example, a frequently used word for 'bank' is ব. 
The word used for the Egyptian and British currency 'Pound' is ॷ 
(pronounced junayh or gunayh), originating from the English word 'guinea'. 
Some of the adopted words also have alternative words with Arabic 
roots (another word for 'bank' is ..jʿ (ma3raf), meaning 'place to 
change/cash money'). The word used varies from country to country, 
and also sometimes from spoken to written. 
Exercise 2 
Read these Arabic words, which are all adopted from European 
languages, and try to work out their meaning:

Four of the words in Exercise 2 can be made plural using the sound 
feminine plural ending -at (see page 86). Write them out again in the 
plural, as in the example: 

Counting things

Counting things 
Ǻ Look at the following and listen to the recording: 
The dual 
Notice how Arabic uses the plural for 'three teachers', but not for 'two 
teachers'. This is because there is a special dual ending, ul (-an), which is 
added to the singular: uL.ᄣ..I-o (mudarrisan) two teachers. There is no 
need to also use the number 2, ithnan, as the dual ending already gives 
you this information. So 'two dogs' would be u4J$: (kalban), 'two girls' 
uᄤ (bintan), etc. An alternative form of the dual ending is -ayn 
(kalbayn, bintayn), which is more common in spoken dialects. 

1 20 
Unit 1 0  
When the dual ending is added to feminine words ending in ta ' marbOta, 
this unties and so must be pronounced: 
Feminine singular 
Feminine dual 
ᄥᄣ..I.o (mudarrisa) teacher %/ ul.:i..ᄣ..1.0 (mudarrisalan/-1ayn) 
;)..)4,.,. (sayyara) car 
% / u\.:j..)4,.,. (sayyaralan/-1ayn) 
Plural with numbers 
1 The masculine plural uJ-"ᄣ..I.o (mudarrisOn) becomes ᄦᄣ..I.o 
(mudarriSIn) when it follows a number. The -Tn ending is an alternative 
sound masculine plural that is sometimes used in Modern Standard 
Arabic (see 'Structure notes' at the end of this unit for further 
explanation). Spoken dialects tend to use -Tn almost exclusively, so as a 
beginner you can do the same. 
2 You may see the numbers with or without the final ta ' marbOta, e.g. 
'three' as ..:,)U (thalath) or u)U (thalatha). Strictly speaking, a 
masculine noun should be preceded by the number including ta ' 
marbOta and a feminine noun by the number without ta ' marbOta, the 
opposite to what you might expect: 
ᄦᄣ..I.o u)U (thalaathat mudarrisTn) three (male) teachers 
-:.L..ᄣ..1.0 ..:,)U (thalaath mudarrisat) three (female) teachers 1 
This use of ta ' marbOta with the masculine is an unusual feature that even 
native speakers can overlook. Spoken dialects tend to simplify the rules, 
keeping the ta ' marbOta when the number is pronounced by itself, but 
dropping it when there is a noun following the number. As a beginner, 
you can do the same while being aware of the more formal rules. 
Exercise 4 
Say and write these words in the dual, as in the example. What do they 
mean?

(kam dan'ja) How many bicycles? 
kam

singular 
In addition, if the word following kam does not end in tal marbOta (Le. 
almost all masculine nouns), an extra ending is added: (, pronounced -an.

Describing what you have 
Arabic does not generally use a verb to express the meaning of 
the English 'have/has'. Instead a number of prepositions are used. 
ȳ (Ii, to), ̈ (t,inda, at) and ဪ (mata, with) are three of the most 
common prepositions used in this way. The preposition is followed by 
the possessor, as in the following examples: 

Counting things 
.b..l:!..J.:>- b.) ॴ (li-muTammad sayyara jadTda.) 
Mohammad has a new car. ('to Mohammad a new car') 
.,:-,-"j b..l)U b.)L.. ဟ (t!nda sara qiladat dhahab.) 
Sarah has a gold necklace. ('at Sarah a gold necklace') 
.লi ॵ အI (al-qalam mata ukhtT.) 
My sister has the pen. ('the pen is with my sister') 
727 
ȳ (Ii) is written as part of the word that follows. If it is put before al-, the 
combination becomes .. . ..1.l (Iil-): 
.ဣဤ.;.:iဥ '":"':'"Ƿ (Iil-muTasib kompyOtir qadTm.) I 
The accountant has an old computer. 
You can also use these prepositions with the attached pronouns (see Unit 5): 
.ঠ 
.. )ဢI ဝ ti J (IT akh fT l-barazT1.) 
I have a brother in Brazil. 
.ঝ လ uဟ (t!ndaha kalb 3aghTr.) 
She has a small dog. 
k 
.• -:!ট ॳ (matak kibrTt?) 
Do you have any matches? 
Plural attached pronouns 
The most common plural attached pronouns are Ɠ (-kum) your (plural), 
L:. (-na) our, and i"" (-hum) their. These can be attached to nouns or 
prepositions in the same way as the singular pronouns. 
ှJU:i..>-! ဠဟ JA (hal t!ndakum burtuqal?) Do you (pl.) 
have any oranges? 
.জi ছ ঞ.J A သ (baytna kabTr walakin bayt-hum

tt " Conversation 
In the market 
Put all you've learnt in this unit to good use in the market. You're going 
to buy some jewellery. You'll need to think about how to say the 
following in Arabic: 
- Good evening. 
- I'd like a silver ring, please. 
- How much is the ring? 
- Here you are. Seven pounds. 
- Do you have a bag*? 
-Thank you. Goodbye. 
Now join in the conversation on the recording, saying your part in the 
pauses. 
*Tip: A bag to take away purchases is ̉ (kTS). 
̊ (:aqTba) = handbag, suitcase, etc. 
Structure notes 
Case endings for the sound masculine plural 
The sound masculine plural does not have the same case endings as 
other nouns. The nominative is mudarrisOn, but the genitive is 
mudarrisIn. 
The numbers 3 to 1 0  are always followed by a plural noun in the 
genitive. This is what causes the sound masculine plural ending to 
change from -On to -Tn . 
. ȲI ა ॲǯ .!ll:..A (hunaka mu:asibOn fT I-bank) 
There are accountants in the bank. 
-
.ȲI ა U=+wǯ ॱ .!ll:..A (hunaka sitta muTasibIn fT I-bank) 
There are six accountants in the bank. 
This change is one of the few instances when a case ending affects the 
spelling, so it is important to know when it is used.

All these words have a connection with writing. Can you find the three 
letters that occur in all these words? 
You should be able to pick out quite easily the three common letters: 
cl 
kat

ba' 
. 
j 
1 3 1  

1 32 
Unit 1 1  
Notice how the letters always appear in the same order. The ba' does not 
come before the ta' in any of the words, nor the kat after the ta', etc. 
So we can say that if the sequence of letters '7'/.:;.,/.!l (reading from right 
to left) appears in a word, the word will have something to do with the 
meaning of 'writing'. These three letters are the root GĕI, al-ma3dar) 
connected with writing. 
The eight words above are made up of the three root letters, with 
different long and short vowels between them and sometimes with extra 
letters added onto the beginning and/or the end of the root letters:

The great majority of Arabic words are formed around a sequence of 
three root letters, and learning to recognise these will help you 
enormously with learning the language. 
You can often (but not always) find the root of a word by ignoring the 
vowels (long and short) and removing the extra letters at the beginning 
and end. As you learn more about the structure of Arabic, you will learn 
to recognise these extra letters. For the moment, it is enough to know

that mTm is a common extra letter on the front of a sequence (prefIX) and 
ta' marbOta is a common extra letter on the end (suffIX).

know, as in the example. The left-hand column tells you the general

Plural patterns 1 and 2 
You already know two ways of making words plural: 
1 Sound masculine plural. This can be used only with some words that 
refer to male people: 
(mudarrisOn/mudarrisTn) ਌P..l.o / u.,...PJ.o ... - (mudarris) U"PJ.o 
2 Sound feminine plura/. This can be used with most words that refer to 
female people, and with some other masculine and feminine words: 
(mumarriQat) uL.;w 
(mumarriQa) zw 
(sayyarat) ul.)v <OIl- (sayyara) :.)਒ 
(tilTfOnat) uxy ...- (tiITfOn) uy 

1 34 
Unit 1 1  
However, many Arabic words cannot be made plural in either of these 
ways. They are made plural by following different patterns which you 
will learn in the next few chapters.

Now write the vowels on the words. 
Broken plurals 
Notice that although the vowels on the singular words may vary, they 
are always the same in the plural pattern. These plural patterns are 
known as broken plurals because the word is 'broken apart' and different 
long and short vowels are arranged around the root letters. 
The two patterns you have met in this unit are examples of broken 
plurals. Arabic will also often fit loan words originated from other 
languages, such as 'film' and 'bank', into the broken plural patterns if 
they have three consonants (Le. letters that are not vowels). 
There are about a dozen significant different broken plural patterns, 
seven or eight of these being the most common. You will gradually be 
introduced to the different patterns.

Vocabulary learning 
From now on, try to learn each word with its plural. If you are using the 
card system (see Unit I), write the plural below the singular: 
Tip: Just writing the plural will help you to remember it. Make sure that 
you can remember both the singular and the plural before the card 
passes into the next envelope. 
What are these?

Notice that there are two different ways of saying 'these' in Arabic: 
hadhihi suyot (these are swords), or ha'ula'i mulOk (these are kings).

human plurals (masculine 
and feminine) 
Although ", "ijA (ha'ula'i) is the plural of 1.iA (hadha) and l>.iA (hadhihi), it 
is only used when talking about people. Arabic divides plurals into: 
1 
Humans (people) 
2 
Non-humans (objects, ideas, animals, etc.) 
In other words, you should use the same words with non-human plurals as 
you do with a feminine singular word. The same grammatical rules apply 
to non-human plurals as to the feminine singular. For example: 
• Use l>.iA: .jؙ l>.iA (These are swords.) 
• Use ȵ: b..wLJI ..,k ঐ ¬1.F")Ui 0-:!i (Where are my pens? They're 
on the table.) 
• Use an adjective with a ta' marbOƏa: ˯ u˰1 (The houses are 
beautiful.) 
Modern Standard Arabic grammar treats all non-human plurals as feminine 
singular. There is no exception to this.

Unit 1 1  
Structure notes 
The accusative case 
The third, and final, case in Arabic is the accusative (˱I, an-nasb). This 
is made by adding two fatDas (উ) on the end of the ˲ord for the 
'
indefinite 
(pronounced 'an') and one fatDa for the definite (pronounced 'a'). 
The table below is a summary of all the case endings: 
Indefinite 
Definite 
., 
, 
Nominative 
 (bintun) 
ȩI (al-binty) 
. 
Accusative 
ই (bintan) 
ঈI (al-bintg) 
Genitive 
 (bintln) 
ȩI (al-bintl) 
Note that the accusative indefinite has an extra alif written on the end 
of the word, called 'alif tanwTn'. The alif tanwTn is not written if the 
word ends in a ta' marbOƏa: 
. 
. 
1..I.o (madTnatan) 
;;.;4w (sayyaratan) 
The alif tanwin is one of the relatively few instances when a case 
ending can affect the basic script, so it helps if you understand why it 
is used. 
The accusative case is used for the object of a verb: 
.k࿰ ..u 
.. ) (urTd shumOtan) I'd like some candles. 
.. 
..
.;
 
Զ ... t 
.;;˳I ˴I ˵I (ufa<;l<;lil al-qubbatatg l-kabTra) I prefer the big hat. 
and for adverbial phrases where the meaning is 'with', 'by', 'in the', etc.: 
lfo (shukran) with thanks (i.e. 'thank you') 
, 
७८ (3abaDQD) in the morning 
The accusative is also used after the question word 03 (kam, how 
many?). This explains the extra alif which appears when a noun not 
ending in ta' marbOĝa follows kam: 
. 
0I.J.J 3 (kam waladQD) how many boys? 
. 
01..I.o 3 (kam madTnatQD) how many towns? 
Almost all nouns and adjectives, whether they are singular, dual, 
plural, masculine or feminine, have case endings in formal Arabic. 
The main exception to this is words of foreign origin (e.g.: .j-:!JI.; 
radyO) when, although theoretically possible, case endings would 
be very clumsy.

Unit 72 
Verbs in the past 
The verbs you have met in this unit describe things which have 
happened in the past. They are in the past tense (cLJI al-mii<;IT). You 
will have noticed that the end of the verb changes slightly, depending on 
who carried out the action (depending on the subject of the verb). 
Look at how this verb changes depending on the subject: 
?>,J (wajadtu) 
?>,J (wajadta) 
?>,J (wajadti) 
>,J (wajada) 
?>,J (wajadat) 
I found 
you (masc.) found 
you (fern.) found 
he found 
she found 
Notice how Arabic does not normally use the personal pronouns 
(L.:.i/ ..:.Wi/",..,., etc.) with the verb as the ending tells you if it is 'I', 'you', etc. 
Look again at the list above. You can see that the verb always begins 
with ॷJ (wajad). This is the stem of the verb and contains the three root 
letters. (The root letters oJ/ r;,l.J are connected with the meaning of 
'finding'.) The endings added to the stem tell you the subject of the verb:

757 
In spoken dialects the final vowel is often dropped after ana and anta, so 
both become wajadt, and for huwa, which becomes wajad. 
You may have noticed that without the vowels the word: 
1.:.I.).7'-,J 
could have at least four different meanings: 
u>,J I found 
u>,J you (masc.) found 
u>,J you (fern.) found 
u>,J she found 
There is no automatic way of telling which meaning is intended. 
However, the context will usually give you a good indication. 
Tip: The stems of the verbs are vowelled mainly with two fat:as (wQjQd). 
Sometimes, however, the second vowel can be a kasra (see the last two 
verbs in the table). Do not spend too much time trying to remember 
these. The most important thing is to listen for the root letters. 
Exercise 5 
Write the correct form of the verb in the gap. The first is an example:

Using a dictionary 
You have now reached the point where you should buy one or more 
dictionaries to help you expand your vocabulary by yourself and to look 
up words that you come across in magazines, newspapers, etc. 
It is possible to put Arabic in alphabetical order in two ways: 
1 According to the order of the letters in a word - as we do in English. 
2 According to the order of the root letters in a word. 
For example, imagine you want to look up this word: Ȥ (maktab). 
- with method 1 you would look under '-:' /..:. /.!l / ॗ (reading right to left). 
- with method 2 you would look under '-:' /..:. /.!l, the root letters. 
Although the first method is becoming more common, especially as it 
means that alphabetisation can be carried out by a computer, the 
second method is still used in many standard reference works. 
So far, we have written the root letters separately: '-:' /..:. /.!l. I 
For the sake of convenience, most linguists and dictionaries use 
the stem of the past tense to express the root. So we can say that 
ȥ is the root of ,-:,l:iS: (kiUib) and Ȥ (maktab); or that U",)J 
is the root of 6....,)..1.0 (madrasa). 
J 
There are a number of Arabic-English dictionaries on the market, some 
designed for native speakers and some for learners of Arabic. We suggest 
that you buy one designed for learners, as the others do not always show 
you the vowels or the plurals (as a native speaker you are expected to 
know them). 
The most popular dictionary designed for learners is A Dictionary of 
Modern Arabic by Hans Wehr (Otto Harrassowitz, 1993). Although 
originally compiled in the 1960s, it has been updated several times and 
is still the most respected Arabic-English dictionary for learners of 
Arabic. Words are listed under the root letters. 
Appendix I, which lists the Arabic letters in alphabetical order, will be 
a useful reference when you are using a dictionary. 
Page 162 shows an example page from the Hans Wehr dictionary, 
showing the entries under the root U",)J.

Structure notes 
Sound masculine plural and dual case endings 
The sound masculine plural (SMP) and dual case endings vary from the 
regular case endings. They affect the basic script and the pronounced part of 
the word. The SMP and dual endings are the same for both the definite 
and indefinite, so there are only two possible variations for each: 
SMP 
Dual 
Nominative 
U,")Ⴈ (najjarOn) UIJႨ (najjaran) 
Accusative + genitive 
U->..)Ⴈ (najjarIn) 
U->..)Ⴈ (najjar̓D) 
The article on page 147 has the title ȣ t-" ˸I (at -ta:qTq mata 
li33ayn, The investigation is with two thieves). The dual ending is 
genitive as ȣ (li33ayn) follows the preposition t-" (mata). 

7 64 
Unit 72 
Sound feminine plural 
The sound feminine plural (SFP) has regular case endings, except for the 
accusative indefinite, which is the same as the genitive indefinite: 
Nominative 
Accusative 
Genitive

Notice that the SFP accusative indefinite, like ta' marbOta, does not have 
the extra alif tanwTn:

To express plural and other patterns in Arabic, the three root letters J 
J I t/.j are used as a standard template (JU = 'to do/to make'). We can 
therefore say that the plural pattern 3 is the Jk,i (fital) pattern, and 
pattern 4 is the JU (futal) pattern. Here are the four broken plural

Notice that to say 'twenty-one', 'fifty-six', etc. in Arabic, you say waTid 
wa-t!shrTn ('one and twenty'), sitta wa-khamsTn ('six and fifty'), etc. The 
units come before the tens. 
Tip: The tens from 20 to 90 have an alternative ending, UJ (-On): t!shron, 
thalathOn, etc. However, most spoken dialects use the U-:! (-Tn) ending 
consistently and so this is the more useful pronunciation to learn initially. 
See the 'Structure notes' at the end of the unit for more details.

Unit 1 3  
Numbers 11 upwards with singular noun 
The numbers 11 upwards are followed by a singular noun. In addition, 
the singular noun following a number above 11 will have the extra alit 
tanwTn (-an ending) if the noun does not end in ta ' marbOta. This is similar 
to what happens after kam? (how many?). 
ी ,   (ithnatashar jabalan) 
ì Jु  .  (thalathTn sayyara) 
twelve mountains 
thirty cars 
It is as if in English we were to say 'three cars' but 'thirty car'. This may 
seem bizarre to a learner, but it is important to remember as it is true 
even of spoken dialects. 
In high-level Modern Standard Arabic, numbers used in a sentence 
can change slightly depending on whether they are referring to a 
masculine or a feminine noun, and what function they have in the 
sentence. However, these changes are complicated and not often seen or 
heard. Many native speakers do not remember them in detail, and as a 
beginner you can stick to the forms given here. Be prepared, however, to 
hear or see some variations.

Describing the weather 
Look at the newspaper weather chart on page 175. The right-hand 
column is a list of place names. Then there are two columns of figures. 
What do you think these represent? 
- The first (right-hand) column of figures is the minimum ('smallest') 
temperature: (SོI (a3-3ughra) 
, 
, 
- The second is the maximum ('biggest') temperature: (SཽI (al-kubra) 
The final left-hand column is a general description of the weather.

The numbers 20, 30, 40, etc. have the same endings as the sound masculine 
plural: they end in uJ -On in the nominative, and U:! -Tn in the accusative and 
genitive. Only in more formal Standard Arabic are the nominative numbers 
generally used. The -Tn pronunciation is more practical for a learner to use.

In Unit 10 you met some English words that have been adopted into

usually making their way into English via Arabic literature and science 
or from contact, through trade for example, between Arabic speakers 
and Europeans.

Hamza as a root letter 
Notice that ..>:؈ . ..f and ჂჃ both have hamza as one of their root 
letters. 
In the case of ..>;!-Oi, hamza is the first root letter; and in the case of 
˹˺, the second root letter. 
The fact that hamza is one of the root letters makes no difference to 
the patterns except that how the hamza is written may change. At the 
beginning of a word, hamza is written on an alif, but in the middle or 
at the end of a word you may also find it sitting on a ya' (with no 
dots), on a waw, or by itself on the line: 
Ⴢ..) (ra'Ts) 
"L..j..) (ru'asa') 
Hamza is listed in the dictionary un(jer alif. So for Ⴢ..) (ra'Ts) you 
would look under (.)"1..), and for ..>;!-Oi under y>1.

Note that a female minister, ambassador, etc. will have a ta' marbOőa

plural (-at):

subject: The minister convened a meeting; Zaynab opened the safe. 

All the President's men 
1 89 
Arabic order: 
3 rest of sentence 
English order: 
I 
The minister convened a meeting with . . .  
1 1SU I 
2 V!'b 
However, Arabic word order is more flexible than English and you 
sometimes find the verb and the subject the other way around. This is 
especially true of less formal Arabic as it reflects what happens in spoken 
dialects where the verb usually comes after the subject. For the moment, 
it is easier to stick to the more standard order above.

Tip: Notice how Arabic puts al- ('the') before every department, whereas 
English only sometimes does. 
Listen a few times to the recording of the cabinet ministers, looking at page 
190. Then listen again without looking at the text. Pause the recording 
after each minister and check whether you can remember the meaning. 
Exercise 8 
Look at the newspaper headlines below. Decide which two people, or 
groups of people, are the subject of each headline. 
Now describe the headlines, using one of the three model sentences below: 
.uद4 ༲ .uJ1 ǩ <=I >I 
Prince Abdullah received the Ambassador of Pakistan .

.l./׾ uऺ 
How many people are the subject of each sentence? 
-
The first sentence has only one subject: ၺ..>:!-"  ၷI (Prince Hassan). 
-
The second sentence has two subjects: Jၻ.,r.JI ..r'..jၼI.) ၺ..>:!-"  ၷI 
(Prince Hassan and the British minister). 
-
The third sentence has three subjects: ... ၽ..>:!-"  ၷI.) ... dy:.i..>:!-" ၷI 
'?झ uL.k ၾI.) (Prince Ashraf, Prince Mohammed and Mr Uthman 
Hamdi). 
All the verbs, however, are in the masculine singular. If a verb comes 
before its subject it will always be singular, even if the subject is plural. 
The verb will change according to whether the subject is masculine or 
feminine, but not according to whether it is singular or plural. 
Verbs that come after the subject will be Singular for a Singular subject 
and plural for a plural subject: 
plural verb 
after subject 
subject 
(masc. plural) 
Singular verb 
before subject 
The ministers received the French Ambassador and held a 
meeting.

All the President's men 
Structure notes 
More about i<;Jafa 
Look at these two phrases: 
;;LJ5I 6I the German Ambassador 
7LJi 8 the Ambassador of Germany 
7 95 
These are two different phrases expressing the same meaning. (The English 
translations are also different ways of expressing the same meaning.) 
The first phrase uses an adjective to describe the nationality of the 
ambassador. The adjective 'al-almanT' comes after the noun 'as-safTr' 
in Arabic, and both have the article 'al-' as the adjective describes a 
definite noun. 
The second phrase is an i<;iafa construction (two or more nouns 
together). Remember that only the last noun in an i<;iafa can have 
'al-' (although it does not have to). So, in the second phrase above, 
the word 'safTr' does not have 'al-', even though it means 'the 
ambassador'. 
If you want to use an adjective to describe an ic;Jafa, the adjective must 
come after the whole ic;Jafa. You cannot put an adjective in the middle 
of the nouns in an i<;iafa: 
JI>.!)'I 9,) . .;JI >.!:;,J the Iranian Minister of the Exterior 
You could also use an i<;iafa with three nouns that would have the 
same meaning as the above: 
ul>.!! 9.>L.:.. >.!:;,J the Minister of the Exterior of Iran 
Notice that the word kharijiyya doesn't have 'al-' as it is no longer the 
last word in the i<;iafa. 
Optional exercise 
Look back at the headlines in Exercise 8. List all the examples of 
phrases using an adjective for nationalities and those using just an 
i<;iafa. For example: 
ul:i...S:: 8 the Ambassador of Pakistan (i<;iafa) 
l?;1 <,)I the Egyptian President (noun + adjective) 
Now reverse the form of the phrases, for example: 
;;l:i...S:4J1 6I the Pakistani Ambassador 
= <.> the President of Egypt

In spoken Arabic you will often hear the regular (cardinal) numbers 
used with time, for example as-sata ithnayn/thalatha, two/three o'clock. 
Tip: ׺L.. (sata) can also mean 'clock' or 'watch' as well as 'hour'.

Arabic uses the words ni3f, half, and rubb quarter, to describe 30 and 
15 minutes as English does. In addition, the word thulth, third, is used to 
describe 20 minutes (a third of an hour).

Arabic doesn't have the equivalent of the English words 'at' or 'on' when 
talking about time. Days of the week and times are simply put directly

Unit 7 6  
Present tense 
In this unit you have met some verbs in the present tense, used when 
talking about what happens routinely or what is happening now. In the 
past tense, endings are added after the root letters to show the subject. 
The present tense is mainly formed by adding prefixes before the root, 
although there are sometimes also endings. 
Here is an example of a present verb, using the verb 'drink'. The 
prefixes and endings around the root are underlined. 
I drink 
you (mase.) drink 
you (fem.) drink 
he drinks 
she drinks 
we drink 
you (pl.) drink 
they drink 
(Qshrab) ,,:,໮i 
(rnshrab) ":'M 
(rnshrablna) ࢬM 
(tQshrab) ":'Ȫ 
(rnshrab) ":'M 
(nashrab) ,,:,.:,..1i 
(rnshrabuna) Uj-!M 
(tQshrabuna) Uj-!Ȫ 
'She' and the three words for 'you' all start with ta- in the present 
tense. The feminine 'you' ends in -Ina and the plural 'you' and 'they' end 
in -una. (In spoken dialects these endings are often shortened to -I and -u.) 
Note that when two alifs combine in Arabic, they are written as one 
with a wavy madda sign above, pronounced a. For example: 
Exercise 6 
I eat 
(akul) [ JSi + i ] JSf Ñ 
Think of three more questions and answers each for Mahmoud and 
Fatima, following the examples on page 217. 
Exercise 7 
Now talk about what you do everyday. First, think about your daily routine. 
What time do you have a wash? Have your breakfast? Leave the house in 
the morning? How do you travel? Return from work, university (˭Ǝ 
jam ita) or school? Have dinner? What do you drink in the evening? 

Every day 
Then write a paragraph about what you do every day. Start like this:

listen to Hisham talking about a typical day at university. Make notes in 
English about the following:

• his daily routine. 
Vocabulary learning 
The middle vowel of the present tense changes from one verb to the next: 
ྺ྿ 
Kf 
ಱ 
(yashrgb) drinks 
(yakhruj) goes out 
(yaghsll) washes 
There is no automatic way of knowing which is the middle vowel, but the 
dictionary will show the present tense vowel separately: 
ज gaaala(!)(gll8l) to wash ('-:' ., 
• B.O., s.th. 
with) ,  
launder 
('-:'

Words for places 
Many Arabic words for places begin with ma- (.:.), for example ສ 
(mattam, restaurant). These words are called nouns of place. The root 
letters connected with a particular activity are put into the pattern ˮ 
(maftal), or sometimes ili.o (maftala) or Jti.o (maftil), to mean the 
place where the activity happens. The roof letters F (t-t -m) are 
connected with food, and so the noun of place, ສ (mattam, 'place of 
food'), has come to mean 'restaurant'. 
Here are some more nouns of place you have already met: 
.t....).lo4 
'place of study', i.e. school, from root (,)"1,)..1 
ວ 
'place of writing', i.e. office or desk, from root  
ຣ 
'place of manufacture', i.e. factory, from root ຩ 
Ǧ 
'place for works of art', i.e. museum, from root ࣿ 
ओ 
'place of sitting', i.e. council, from root ȁ 

Eating and drinking 
23 7 
ᅨ, The plurals of nouns of place are predictable. Listen to these plurals and 
repeat the pattern.

Forms of the verb 
The verbs ऌ (naěaf, cleaned), ຄ (sakhkhan, heated), ຅ (jahhaz, 
prepared) and (..r:.i (akhraj, took out) all follow a slightly different 
pattern from the verbs you already know. This is because they are forms 
of the verb. 
In English you can sometimes find verbs which are derived from the 
same word, but which have slightly different endings which affect the 
meaning, for example: 
liquefy 
liquidate 
liquidise 
Arabic takes this concept of manipulation much further. The root 
letters of a verb can be put into a number of patterns to give different, 
but connected, meanings. These patterns are called forms. 

Eating and drinking 
235 
There are ten forms altogether, but the ninth is rare. The basic form of 
the verb is form I. This is the form you already know. For example: 
ფ/ ȓ (ghasal/yaghsil) to wash 
(.)IoJJქ/ (.)IoJJJ (daras/yadrus) to study 
The other verb forms fall into three groups that share characteristics: 
• Forms II, III and IV 
• Forms V and VI 
• Forms VII, VIII and X 
The verbs ...il;.:. (na??af), ຄ (sakhkhan), ຅ (jahhaz) and ऊ.?i (akhraj) 
all fall into the first group of verb forms. 
Forms II, III and IV 
In the past tense forms II, III and IV are formed as follows: 
• Form II: doubling the second root letter with a shadd a (..:.): 
(fattal ๿) ] (fatal) ๼ 
• Form III: adding a long a after the first root letter: 
(fatal ຀Li) ] (fatal) ๼ 
• Form IV: adding a short a before the first root letter (and a sukOn over it): 
(aft a I ๾h ] (fatal) ๼ 
In the present tense, form II retains its shadda, form III its long a and 
form IV its sukOn, but all three forms are vowelled with a <;lamma (..:.) as 
the first vowel and a kasra (_) as the last.

Form IV 
(aftal) J.UI 

236 
Unit 1 7  
The different forms have various general meaning patterns connected 
with them. For example, forms II and IV often make an action transitive 
(Le. carrying out the action on someone/something else). So ǟ 
(sakhan) means 'to be hot', but form II ຄ (sakhkhan) means 'to make 
hot' or 'to he.at'. In a similar way, (..? (kharaj) means 'to go out', but 
form IV (..?I (akhraj) means 'to take out' or 'to eject'. 
Form III can have the meaning pattern of doing something with 
someone else. For example, ȥ (katab) means 'to write', but ࣻl5: 
(katab) means 'to write to someone else' or 'to correspond with'. 
These meaning patterns are a guide which can help you expand your 
vocabulary through your knowledge of root letters. However, sometimes 
the reason why a particular form is used for a particular meaning is not 
obvious or has become altered over time, and you need to remember the 
individual verb. 
The variations in the forms of the verb do not affect the endings and 
prefixes used to show the subject. These remain the same as those you 
have already learnt - see pages 156 and 218. The exception is that the 
first vowel of the present verb becomes 'u' in forms II, III and IV rather 
than 'a' in all the other forms: 
ġ̐I ๻ JA Did you heat the bread? 
(hal sakhkhanta I-khubz?) (form II) 
. .),isl..b..J4 uāL.. We travelled by plane. 
(satarna biHa'ira) (form II) 
·J..J4jJl uध ࢏  	 Js Every day they take out the rubbish.

• 
- t 
.{W:a.a..J1 Ǡ .)J,.JWI ೈI I clean the table after dinner. 
(unaěif al-rna'ida batda I-tasha') (form II) 
Forms of the verb in the dictionary 
Very few root letters can be put into all the forms of the verb. Generally, 
most roots have some forms in common circulation. 
If you look up a verb in Wehr's dictionary, you will find the forms 
referred to by Roman numerals. In the example entry for the root ǟ 
on page 237, you can see that forms II and IV exist (although IV is not 
common). None of the other forms is used with this root.

Unit 7 7  
Attached pronouns 
In English we say 'our house', putting the pronoun 'our' before the noun 
'house'. However, with a verb we use a different pronoun and we put it 
after the verb: 'he saw us'. The same is true of 'their dog' and 'I helped 
them', 'its door' and 'she cleaned it', etc. 
Arabic doesn't make this distinction. The same pronouns can be used 
with a verb or a noun, and they all come attached to the end of the 
word. For this reason, they are known as attached pronouns. You have 
already learnt these attached pronouns with nouns (see pages 60 and 
127). Now you can also use them with verbs. The one small difference is 
that the attached pronoun -i (my) becomes -ni when used with a verb: 
इu.s: (kitabI) my book 
,;J..j.j-ll IJ i ! 1'; i ",1 (istaqbalanI al-wazTr) the minister received me 
Remember that non-human plurals are treated as feminine singular: 
his/him, its/it (masculine singular) = आ (-hu) 
her, it/its (feminine singular) = 4- (-ha) 
their/them (human plurals) = ๮ (-hum) 
their/them (non-human plural) = 4-(-ha) - same as feminine singular 
Exercise 10 
Look at the tasks on page 234 that Ahmed should have completed, and 
write three more questions and answers between the owner and Ahmed, 
following the examples on page 237.

Unit 77 
t is more common in Modern Standard Arabic and lo is more common 
in spoken Arabic, but both are acceptable. 
It can seem confusing that the past negative can be made with t and 
a present verb, but you can draw analogies to English - we say 'He washed 
the dishes' but 'he didn't wash the dishes'. 
๥en t is put in front of the present verb parts for ऀi (anti, you fern.), 
p:.1 (antum, you pI.) and ࣶ (hum, they), the verb loses the nOn on the 
end. An extra, silent alif is written after the final w?Jw.

Comparatives (taller, older, etc.) and superlatives (tallest, oldest, etc.) are 
formed in Arabic using the following pattern: 
J.:!ç tall/long --. root letters J/J/, --. J-i taller/tallest 
r":!࣯ old --. root /etters r-/J/(j --. r-ࣸi older/oldest 
Ǜǜ fast --. root letters t/J/. --. t/i faster/fastest 

246 
Unit 18 
Comparatives do not usually change according to whether they are 
describing something masculine, feminine or plural. The pattern 
remains the same: 
. .uJÍ1 . ࡥ (0i .jA It's the oldest palace in the country. 
(huwa aqdam qa3r fT d-dawla) 
.ఋ,)ఌI . ȍ J1i  She's the tallest girl in the school.

.ײ 'J J '11 j:. 'J j.A 0A t:.,.wi 2 They're faster than these boys. 
(hum asrat min ha'ula'i I-awlad) 
If the second and third root letters of an adjective are the same, they 
are written together with a shadda (..:..) in the comparative. If the third 
root letter is waw or ya', this changes to alif maq3Ora (see tip on page 77) 
in the comparative: 
I ไ light -> rot /eff", ,J/,J/i:. ->,: Áf Iighterllightest J 
L ๅ sweet --+ root letters J/J/r.. --+ ๆI sweeter/sweetest

Many sentences do not need the verb 'to be' in the present. However, it is 
required in the past. The verb uL5: (kan) is used. 
kan is a little different from the other verbs you have met so far as it 
seems to have only two root letters. The root is actually ulJ/ʴ, but the 
waw can change into a long or short vowel. In the past tense, the parts of 
the verb for huwa (he), hiya (she) and hum (they) have a long a in the 
middle, but the other parts of the verb have a short u. However, the 
endings indicating the subject are still the same as other verbs: 
I was

Unit 1 8  
When the information that follows the verb kan (the predicate) is a noun 
or adjective without ta ' marbOta, you need to add the additional alif 
tanwTn (1\ see page 144:

2 The weather was hot yesterday. 
3 I was in the office on Saturday. 
4 The tree was taller than my house. 
S Where were you (pl.) at 9 o'clock? 
6 We were in the centre of town.

Now join the sentences in Exercise 7 using USJJ (wa-Iakin), for example: 
, 
.1 W2I ࡍJ ศ ส.s; ห w-a ࣯ 
Can you make two or three comparisons in Arabic like this about your life 
now and in the past? 
Weak verbs 
Verbs like kan that have either waw (,) or ya' «.5) as one of the root letters 
are called weak verbs. This is because waw and -ya' are 'weak' letters that 
can be pronounced as consonants (w or y) or as vowels. 
Most irregularities in Arabic verbs are due to waw or ya' being one of 
the root letters, particularly the second or third root. The main 
consequence is that the root sound is often replaced by a long or short 
vowel, leaving only two obvious root consonants. 
The precise rules as to how weak verbs behave take time and practice 
to absorb. However, it is possible to follow some general principles. 
Hollow verbs 
Weak verbs with waw (,) or ya' «.5) as the second root letter are called 
hollow verbs since the middle root letter often disappears. kan is a hollow 
verb, as are many other common verbs. Their main charactistics are: 
In the past: 
- huwa, hiya and hum have a long a in the middle (d.LS: (kƋnat), she was; 
I.JL (bƋtO), they sold) 
- the other parts of the verb have a short vowel in the middle: u if the 
middle root letter is waw (:-,',S (kyntu), I was); and i if the middle root is 
ya' (ษ (b1tna), we sold). 
In the present: 
- there is a long vowel in the middle: T if the middle root letter is ya' 
(..u-.J.:! (yazTd), it increases); and usually 0 if the middle root letter is 
waw ()J.) (azOr), I visit). 
Defective verbs 
Weak verbs with waw (,) or ya' «.5) as the third root letter are called 
defective verbs. They are characterised by a long vowel at the end 
(˟/..;:.:.o (masha/yamsh1), to walk; A/1.5.:. (shakaJyashkO, to 
complain). 
In the past tense, this long vowel can change to ay or aw when an 
ending is added (:-'lࣰ';' 0 (mashaytu), I walked; L:.fo (shakawna), we 
complained), 

254 
Weak verbs in the dictionary 
You will need to look up weak verbs using the root letters, 
induding waw (,) or ya' «(5). 
Unit 18 
If  you see the past of a hollow verb written like this - .) lb  - or 
like this without vowels - u࣮ - you will not be able to tell 
whether the middle root letter is waw or ya'. You may have to 
look in the dictionary under both roots. When you find the 
correct root you will see an entry like this: 
( Ȋ) Jll. !(ira i (.JIȊ layartin) to fly; to 
fly away, fly off, take to the wing; to 
hasten, hurry, rush, fly (JI to) ; to be 
in a state of commotion, be jubilant, 
exult, rejoice; ..,. Jll. to snatch away,

Forms of the verb: V and VI 
The second group of verbal forms comprises forms V and VI. 
In the past tense, forms V and VI look like forms II and III with ...:; (ta-)

Form VI 
Many common verbs are form V, and, like form I, the meaning is often 
intransitive (something you do yourself rather than an action performed 
on someone/something else). In contrast, form VI often carries the 
meaning of doing something together, or as a group.

both, e.g. ฟ.j:U (tatadhakkar, you remember). In fact, the present tense of

Exercise 11 
Write a short letter to a friend telling him or her about a day trip you 
took yesterday to an historic town near you. Look back at page 180 to 
remind yourself of some useful general phrases for letter writing. Follow 
this plan for your letter: 
• open with some greetings 
• tell your friend where you were yesterday 
• ask your friend if he/she remembers this town 
• you were with your friends, Nadia and Anwar 
• you travelled by train because it's faster than the bus 
• the weather was very cold, but the town was beautiful 
• you visited the museum, but you didn't go to the market 
• you learnt about the history of the town 
• in the past, the museum was a palace (the oldest in the country) 
• you didn't eat in a restaurant, you took sandwiches (d :;.i.!,J࣭) 
This exercise is a chance for you to create your own letter. There's no 
definitive correct answer, but it is a good idea to show your letter to a 
teacher or an Arabic-speaking friend if possible.

If you look at the top of an Arabic newspaper or website, you 
may well see two dates. One refers to the Western calendar 
and one to the Muslim calendar. The most famous month of 
the Muslim calendar is Ramadan, the month of fasting. The 
Muslim date will have the letter ha' (..A) after it, which stands 
for hijra (b˜) or 'flight', as the calendar starts with the 
Prophet Muhammad's flight from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. 
The Wester':!- date is followed by a mTm (å), which stands for 
mTladTyya (ʦJ)4.0) or 'birth' (of Christ). 
There are also alternative names for the months of the 
Western calendar, which are used in some Arab countries. The 
more international names are used here, but the alternatives 
and the months of the Muslim calendar appear in Appendix 3 
for reference.

Other features of verbs 
You now have a good idea about how Arabic verbs work in general, 
including the past and present tenses, the future using sa- with the 
present tense, negative verbs, weak verbs, and forms of the verb. 
There are other features of Arabic verbs which will help you to 
recognise vocabulary and manipulate roots. For example, verbs can be 
turned into nouns or participles to create related words. These often 
follow predictable patterns, particularly with the forms of the verb. Here

In your final review, you're going to tell us about yourself, your job or 
studies, and what you did for your holiday last year. 
Firstly, prepare the following information in Arabic. Look back at the 
relevant units if you need to remind yourself of the language you'll need. 
• your name 
• where you're from 
• your occupation (job/student - look in a dictionary if necessary) 
• where you went for your holiday last year 
• what month it was 
• how you travelled 
• what the weather was like 
• one thing you did on holiday and one thing you ate 
• one thing you didn't do 
Now join in the conversations on the recording. You'll be asked questions 
which will prompt the information you have prepared. There is no single 
correct answer -the reply is up to you. Replay the conversation as many 
times as you like, making up different answers every time. 
Good luck! !ࢾ b

Unit 20 
Advice on further study 
You have now come to the end of this course and we hope that it has 
encouraged you to continue your study of Arabic. Mastering Arabic has 
given you a solid foundation in the Arabic script and informal standard 
Arabic, as used throughout the Middle East. 
You are now in a position to decide in which direction to go, and this 
obviously depends on your particular needs and interests. Your main 
options are: 
• to continue to study Modern Standard Arabic in more depth 
• to study a particular spoken dialect 
• to branch into the classical language. 
The following notes are intended to help you decide how you would like 
to continue your studies, and to tell you what material is available to 
you. You will probably want to concentrate on one of the above options, 
but they are not mutually exclusive and you may like to sample them all. 
Modern Standard Arabic 
If you have an interest in understanding Arabic in the form of TV and 
radio programmes, newspapers, comics, books, signs, advertisements, 
correspondence, conference proceedings, formal speeches, etc., then 
you should continue to expand your knowledge of Modern Standard 
Arabic (MSA). 
Course books 
There are a number of programmes for MSA which will take you beyond 
the scope of Mastering Arabic. Most have accompanying audio and some 
have video, although this can be expensive. Make sure you choose one 
that matches your needs. Some, for example, are designed for use in a 
classroom and are difficult to follow if you're working by yourself. Others 
may be traditional and not contain a variety of activities and exercises. 
Try to find one which suits your style of learning. You could classify your 
level now as 'early intermediate'. 
If you are interested in continuing to study MSA, you should also make 
sure you have good dictionaries and reference books for grammar, verbs 
and vocabulary. Again, choose carefully. It's better to take your time and 
browse than to choose a title blind and find that it doesn't suit your style 
of learning or your level. If pOSSible, try to find some reference titles that 
include an element of practice (not just the translation of unconnected 
sentences).

279 
Arabic media 
There is a wealth of other material for you to use to improve your 
knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic. The growth of Arabic TV satellite 
stations and internet sites has triggered a renaissance and revitalisation of 
'standard' Arabic. Pan Arab communication has suddenly become much 
more common and immediate than it was before. Politicians, leading 
personalities and members of the public from different parts of the Middle 
East now routinely take part in interviews and chat shows intended for a 
pan Arab audience. It is possible to hear a wide range of Arabic accents 
and levels of formality all within the same programme, and sometimes 
within the same sentence! Arabic-speakers from all walks of life are also 
growing more used to adjusting their language to make themselves 
understood outside their local area. 
Many of these satellite stations are available outside the Middle East, 
as are Arabic newspapers, magazines and comics. You can sometimes 
also find short comic strips and cartoons on Arabic websites. 
Literature 
In 1988 Naguib Mahfouz, an Egyptian writer, won the Nobel prize for 
literature. He died in 2006 at the age of 94. The prize created 
international interest in modern Arabic literature. Mahfouz himself has 
written many novels which can be found outside the Arab World both in 
the original Arabic and in translation. However, Mahfouz's Arabic style is 
difficult for a beginner and it would be better to start with graded 
extracts from literature and then progress to authors such as Taha 
Hussein or Jibran Khalil Jibran, who use a simpler style. Children's books 
and fables are also a good way of introducing yourself to Arabic stories. 
Look around you 
If you go to a part of town where there are a lot of Arabic-speakers, you 
can look at the signs, posters, labels on imported food, etc. A word of 
warning: other languages are also written in Arabic script (for example, 
Farsi and Urdu), so do not panic if you come across material in which all 
the words look totally unfamiliar and the script has some strange 
additions. You will also find ingredients and instructions written in 
Arabic on many food packages and household products. 
Spoken dialects 
Native speakers are not as aware as learners of the differences between 
spoken dialects and Modern Standard, and will slip in and out of them 
quite easily. In informal talk and chat you will find conversations 
difficult to follow if you cannot understand the dialect. 

280 
Unit 20 
If your main interest is in talking to Arabic-speakers in everyday 
informal situations, therefore, you should acquire a knowledge of the 
appropriate spoken dialect. These vary from region to region but are all 
more or less related to MSA, so your knowledge will be very useful. In this 
course, we have tried to point out where there are variations from MSA 
which are common to many spoken dialects, but to gain fluency you will 
need either access to native speakers or a course in your chosen dialect, 
or ideally both. 
There are many programmes designed to teach you the dialect of a 
particular country or region. If pOSSible, choose one that includes Arabic 
script as well as transliteration (English letters). Having mastered the 
script, you will find it useful to be able to compare dialect written in 
Arabic as well as transliteration. If you are unsure about which dialect to 
learn, then it is best to opt for either Egyptian or Levant (Syria, Jordan, 
etc.), as these are the most widely understood. 
Classical Arabic 
Classical Arabic, as used in the Qur'an and other religious and classical 
literature, is structurally not that different from MSA. It is the use of 
vocabulary and the style of the language that varies, just as 
Shakespearian English is different from English in The Times newspaper. 
There are specialist dictionaries and reference books for classical 
Arabic. They are not always very user-friendly, however, and may be old 
and difficult to follow. You may find it easier to continue to study Modern 
Standard and to combine this with reading classical texts which have 
translations alongside the Arabic, so that you acquire a feel for the style. 
o It only remains to wish you luck, and to hope that this book has given 
'-V you the foundation you need to continue to master Arabic.

You can form active and passive participles from verbs. An active 
participle will show the 'doer', or subject, of the action; a passive participle 
will show the 'receiver', or object, of the action. 
Basic verbs 
Active participles are formed using the pattern ඡu (fat!I): 
player/(someone) playing (Iat!b) ࣗ.{ 
.- to play ğ/Ġ 
Passive participles are formed using the pattern Jġ (maftOI): 
(something) broken (maksOr) .)ඟ .- to break.A/Ģ 
These participles can be used as either nouns or adjectives, for example 
.)˛ (maksOr) can mean 'broken' or 'a broken item'. 
Forms of the verb 
Active and passive participles are formed from forms of the verb by 
taking the present verb and: 
• replacing the initial ࢬ (yu-) or ච (ya-) with ࣕ (mu-) 
• vowelling with a final kasra (i) for the active participle and a final fat:a 
(a) for the passive participle: 
trainer (mudarrib) I..,)Ȏȏ .- trains (yudarrib) '-;-IȎࠔ 
trained (person) (mudarrab) I..,)ࠕȏ 
user (mustakhdim) f'ࠑ .- uses (yastakhdim) f'ࠒ 
used (item) (mustakhdam) f'ࠓ
