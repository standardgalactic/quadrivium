Introduction
A
rabic, the official language of over 20 countries, is the mother tongue of
over 300 million people. It’s spoken throughout the Middle East, from
Morocco to Iraq. Additionally, because Arabic is the language of the Koran
and Islam, it’s understood by more than 1.2 billion people across the world.
Due to recent geopolitical events, Arabic has catapulted to the top of the list
of important world languages. Even in countries where Arabic isn’t the offi-
cial language, people are scrambling to master this important and vital global
language.
For people in North America and Europe, at first glance Arabic seems like a
difficult language to master; after all, it isn’t a Romance language and doesn’t
use the Latin alphabet. However, like any other language, Arabic is governed
by a set of rules, and when you master these rules, you’re able to speak
Arabic like a native speaker!
Arabic For Dummies is designed to identify and explain the rules that govern
the Arabic language in the easiest and most interactive way possible. I orga-
nize each chapter in a straightforward and coherent manner and present the
material in an interactive and engaging way.
About This Book
Unlike most books on the Arabic language, Arabic For Dummies is designed in a
way that gives you the most accurate and in-depth information available on the
composition of the language. The book is modular in nature; every chapter is
organized in such a way that you don’t have to read the whole book in order to
understand the topic that’s discussed. Feel free to jump through chapters and
sections to suit your specific needs. Also, every grammatical and linguistic
point is explained in plain English so that you can incorporate the concept
immediately. I took great care to explain every concept clearly and succinctly.
To provide the best foundation and the widest usage for students of Arabic,
Arabic For Dummies focuses on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the
most widely used form of Arabic in the world. There are basically three differ-
ent types of Arabic: Koranic Arabic, local dialects, and MSA.

 Koranic Arabic is the Arabic used to write the Koran, the holy book for
Muslims. This form of Arabic is very rigid and hasn’t changed much since
the Koran was written approximately 1,500 years ago. Koranic Arabic is
widely used in religious circles for prayer, discussions of Islamic issues,
and serious deliberations. Its usage is limited primarily within a strict
religious context. It’s the equivalent of Biblical English.
 The regional dialects are the most informal type of Arabic. They tend
to fall into three geographical categories: the North African dialect
(Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya); the Egyptian dialect (Egypt, parts
of Syria, Palestine, and Jordan); and Gulf Arabic (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Iraq, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates). Even though the words are
pronounced differently and some of the everyday expressions differ
dramatically from region to region, speakers from different regions can
understand each other. The common denominator for the regional
dialects is that they’re all based on MSA.
 Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the most widely used and under-
stood form of Arabic in the world. It’s less rigid than Koranic Arabic
but a bit more formal than the local dialects. MSA is the language that
Arabic anchors use to present the news, professionals use to discuss
business and technical issues, and friends and families use to socialize
with one another.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout the book, each new Arabic word appears in boldface, followed
by its proper pronunciation and its English equivalent in parentheses.
Because this is a language book, I include some sections to help you master
the linguistic concepts with greater ease. Here’s a description of the specialty
sections you find in each chapter:
 Talkin’ the Talk dialogues: Here’s where you get to see Arabic in action.
These common Arabic dialogues show you how to use important vocab-
ulary words and terms you should be aware of. Select Talkin’ the Talk
dialogues have accompanying audio versions on the book’s CD.
 Words to Know blackboards: An important part of mastering a new 
language is becoming familiar with important words and phrases. Key
terms that I recommend you memorize are included in these sections,
which present the transcription of the Arabic word, the pronunciation,
and the translation.
 Fun & Games activities: The aim of Arabic For Dummies is to help you
master the Arabic language in an interactive and engaging way. With that
in mind, each chapter ends with a Fun & Games that lets you review the
key concept covered in the chapter in a fun but effective way.

Arabic For Dummies

What I Assume About You
In writing Arabic For Dummies, I made the following assumptions about my
likely readers:
 You’ve had very little exposure (or none at all) to the Arabic language.
 You’re interested in mastering Arabic for either personal or professional
reasons.

How This Book Is Organized
Arabic For Dummies is organized into five different parts, with each part
divided into chapters. The following part descriptions give you a heads-up on
what to expect in each part.
Part I: Getting Started
The first part of Arabic For Dummies is a must-read if you’ve never been
exposed to Arabic. I introduce the Arabic script and present the 28 letters of
the Arabic alphabet before explaining the difference between consonants and
vowels, which have a very peculiar relationship in Arabic. In addition, in this
part you get a detailed and thorough overview of Arabic grammatical and lin-
guistic constructs; for instance, you find out how nouns, verbs, and adjec-
tives interact with each other to create phrases and sentences. Finally, you
discover some of the most basic forms of greetings and are introduced to
basic words and phrases.
Part II: Arabic in Action
This part exposes you to key words and phrases that allow you to interact
with Arabic-speaking folks in a variety of different settings (such as in a
3
Introduction

restaurant, around town, at the office, or even at the mall). You discover how
to make small talk and how to ask for basic information about people you
speak to, such as their names, where they’re from, and their occupations.
Part III: Arabic on the Go
This part gives you the tools you need to take Arabic on the road with you.
Find out how to open a bank account, how to plan a trip, how to make a
reservation at a hotel, and how to ask for directions.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part share some of the nonverbal methods of communica-
tion that help you to better interact with Arabic-speaking people. For example,
you discover ten of the greatest Arabic proverbs, and you find out proper ways
to interact with people if you’re in an Arabic-speaking country. I also share my
recommendations on the best ways to acquire Arabic as quickly as possible.
Part V: Appendixes
This part is a useful reference if you need information quickly. One of the
appendixes in this part is a detailed list of regular and irregular verbs to help
you conjugate verbs in the past, present, and future tenses. I also include a
mini-dictionary in both Arabic–English and English–Arabic formats for quick
reference. Finally, you find an appendix that guides you through the audio
tracks on the CD.
Icons Used in This Book
In order to help you get in and get out of this book easily and efficiently, I use
icons (little pictures) that identify important pieces of information by cate-
gory. The following icons appear in this book:
When you see this icon, make sure you read carefully. It points to information

Discovering a new language can be a wonderful experience. However, there
are always potential pitfalls to avoid, whether grammatical, linguistic, or
cultural. This icon points out important notions about Arabic that may trip
you up.
Grammar is the glue that binds a language together. Even though this isn’t a
grammar book, it does include important grammar lessons you need to be
aware of. This icon is attached to major grammar points that will help you
master the Arabic language.
This icon points out nonverbal methods of communication common in
Arabic-speaking countries and among Arabic speakers. I use this icon to fill
the gap between language and culture so that you know the cultural contexts

arHaba (mahr-hah-bah; welcome) to the wonderful world of Arabic!
Arabic is the official language of over 20 countries and is spoken by
more than 300 million people across the globe! It’s the language in which the
Koran, the Holy Book in Islam, was revealed and written, and a large majority
of the over 1.3 billion Muslims across the world study Arabic in order to read
the Koran and to fulfill their religious duties. By speaking Arabic, you get
access to people and places from Morocco to Indonesia. (For more on
Arabic’s role in history, see the sidebar “Arabic’s historical importance.”)
In this chapter, I ease you into Arabic by showing you some familiar English
words that trace their roots to Arabic. You discover the Arabic alphabet and
its beautiful letters, and I give you tips on how to pronounce those letters so
that you can sound like a native speaker! Part of exploring a new language is
discovering a new culture and a new way of looking at things, so in this first
chapter of Arabic For Dummies, you begin your discovery of Arabic and its
unique characteristics.
Taking Stock of What’s Familiar
If English is your primary language, part of grasping a new lougha (loo-rah;
language) is creating connections between the kalimaat (kah-lee-maht; words)
of the lougha, in this case Arabic, and English. You may be surprised to hear
that quite a few English words trace their origins to Arabic. For example, did
you know that “magazine,” “candy,” and “coffee” are actually Arabic words?
Table 1-1 lists some familiar English words with Arabic origins.

Arabic’s historical importance
During the Middle Ages, when Europe was
plunged into the Dark Ages, Arab scholars and
historians translated and preserved most of the
works of the Greek scholars, thereby preserving
some of the greatest intellectual achievements
that are the cornerstone of Western civilization!

As you can see from the table, Arabic has had a major influence on the English
language. Some English words such as “admiral” and “arsenal” have an indirect
Arabic origin, whereas others, such as “coffee” and “cotton,” are exact
matches! The influence runs the other way, too, especially when it comes to
relatively contemporary terms. For example, the word tilifizyuun (tee-lee-fee-
zee-yoon; television) comes straight from the word “television.” As is often the
case with languages, Arabic and English tend to influence each other, and that’s
what makes studying them so much fun!
Discovering the Arabic Alphabet
Unlike English and other Romance languages, you write and read Arabic from
right to left. Like English, Arabic has both vowels and consonants, but the
vowels in Arabic aren’t actual letters. Rather, Arabic vowels are symbols that
you place on top of or below consonants to create certain sounds. As for con-
sonants, Arabic has 28 different consonants, and each one is represented by
a letter. In order to vocalize these letters, you place a vowel above or below
the particular consonant. For example, when you put a fatHa, a vowel repre-
senting the “ah” sound, above the consonant representing the letter “b,” you
get the sound “bah.” When you take the same consonant and use a kasra,
which represents the “ee” sound, you get the sound “bee.”
All about vowels
Arabic has three main vowels. Luckily, they’re very simple to pronounce
because they’re similar to English vowels. However, it’s important to realize
that Arabic also has vowel derivatives that are as important as the main
vowels. These vowel derivatives fall into three categories: double vowels, long
vowels, and diphthongs. In this section, I walk you through all the different
vowels, vowel derivatives, and vowel combinations.
11
Chapter 1: You Already Know a Little Arabic

Main vowels
The three main Arabic vowels are:
 fatHah: The first main vowel in Arabic is called a fatHa (feht-hah). A fatHa
is the equivalent of the short “a” in “hat” or “cat.” Occasionally, a fatHa
also sounds like the short “e” in “bet” or “set.” Much like the other vowels,
the way you pronounce a fatHa depends on what consonants come before
or after it. In Arabic script, the fatHa is written as a small horizontal line
above a consonant. In English transcription, which I use in this book, it’s
simply represented by the letter “a,” as in the words kalb (kah-leb; dog) or
walad (wah-lahd; boy).
 damma: The second main Arabic vowel is the damma (dah-mah). A
damma sounds like the “uh” in “foot” or “book.” In Arabic script, it’s
written like a tiny backward “e” above a particular consonant. In English
transcription, it’s represented by the letter “u,” as in funduq (foon-dook;
hotel) or suHub (soo-hoob; clouds).
 kasra: The third main vowel in Arabic is the kasra (kahs-rah), which
sounds like the long “e” in “feet” or “treat.” The kasra is written the
same way as a fatHa — as a small horizontal line — except that it goes
underneath the consonant. In English transcription, it’s written as an “i,”
as in bint (bee-neht; girl) or ‘islaam (ees-lahm; Islam).
Double vowels
One type of vowel derivative is the double vowel, which is known in Arabic as
tanwiin (tahn-ween). The process of tanwiin is a fairly simple one: Basically,
you take a main vowel and place the same vowel right next to it, thus creating
two vowels, or a double vowel. The sound that the double vowel makes
depends on the main vowel that’s doubled. Here are all possible combina-
tions of double vowels:
 Double fatHa: tanwiin with fatHa creates the “an” sound, as in ‘ahlan
wa sahlan (ahel-an wah sahel-an; Hi).
 Double damma: tanwiin with damma creates the “oun” sound. For
example, kouratoun (koo-rah-toon; ball) contains a double damma.
 Double kasra: tanwiin with kasra makes the “een” sound, as in SafHatin
(sahf-hah-teen; page).
Long vowels
Long vowels are derivatives that elongate the main vowels. Seeing as Arabic
is a very poetic and musical language, I believe a musical metaphor is in
order here! Think of the difference between long vowels and short (main)
vowels in terms of a musical beat, and you should be able to differentiate
between them much easier. If a main vowel lasts for one beat, then its long
vowel equivalent lasts for two beats. Whereas you create double vowels by
12
Part I: Getting Started

writing two main vowels next to each other, you create long vowels by adding
a letter to one of the main vowels. Each main vowel has a corresponding con-
sonant that elongates it. Here are a few examples to help you get your head
around this long-vowel process:
 To create a long vowel form of a fatHa, you attach an ‘alif to the conso-
nant that the fatHa is associated with. In English transcription, the long
fatHa form is written as “aa,” such as in kitaab (kee-taab; book) or baab
(bahb; door). The “aa” means that you hold the vowel sound for two
beats as opposed to one.
 The long vowel form of damma is obtained by attaching a waaw to
the consonant with the damma. This addition elongates the vowel “uh”
into a more pronounced “uu,” such as in nuur (noohr; light) or ghuul
(roohl; ghost). Make sure you hold the “uu” vowel for two beats and
not one.
 To create a long vowel form of a kasra, you attach a yaa’ to the conso-
nant with the kasra. Just as the ‘alif elongates the fatHa and the waaw
elongates the damma, the yaa’ elongates the kasra. Some examples
include the “ii” in words like kabiir (kah-beer; big) and Saghiir (sah-reer;
small).
The Arabic characters for the long vowels are shown in Table 1-2.

waaw

yaa’
To create a long vowel form of a kasra
Diphthongs
Diphthongs in Arabic are a special category of vowels because, in essence,
they’re monosyllabic sounds that begin with one vowel and “glide” into
another vowel. A common example in English is the sound at the end of the
word “toy.” Fortunately, Arabic has only two diphthong sounds used to dis-
tinguish between the yaa’ (
) and the waaw (
) forms of long vowels. When
you come across either of these two letters, one of the first questions to ask
yourself is: “Is this a long vowel or a diphthong?” There’s an easy way to
determine which is which: When either the yaa’ or the waaw is a diphthong,
you see a sukun (soo-koon) above the consonant. A sukun is similar to the
main vowels in that it’s a little symbol (a small circle) that you place above
13
Chapter 1: You Already Know a Little Arabic

the consonant. However, unlike the vowels, you don’t vocalize the sukun —
it’s almost like a “silent” vowel. So when a waaw or yaa’ has a sukun over it,
you know that the sound is a diphthong! Here are some examples:
 waaw diphthongs: yawm (yah-oom; day); nawm (nah-oom; sleep); Sawt
(sah-oot; noise)
 yaa’ diphthongs: bayt (bah-yet; house); ‘ayn (ah-yen; eye); layla (lah-ye-
lah; night)
All about consonants
Arabic uses 28 different consonants, and each consonant is represented by a
different letter. Because the Arabic alphabet is written in cursive, most of the
letters connect with each other. For this reason, every single letter that repre-
sents a consonant actually can be written four different ways depending on
its position in a word — whether it’s in the initial, medial, or final positions,
or whether it stands alone. In English transcription of the Arabic script, all
letters are case-sensitive.
Thankfully, most of the consonants in Arabic have English equivalents.
Unfortunately, a few Arabic consonants are quite foreign to nonnative speak-
ers. Table 1-3 shows all 28 Arabic consonants, how they’re written in Arabic,
how they’re transcribed in English, and how they sound. This table can help
you pronounce the letters so that you sound like a native speaker!

So there you have it — all 28 different consonants in the Arabic alphabet! To
sound as fluent as possible, memorize as many of the letters as you can and
try to associate each letter with the Arabic words in which it appears. The
trick to getting the pronunciation of some of these more exotic Arabic sounds
is repetition, repetition, and even more repetition! That old saying, “Practice
makes perfect” certainly applies to Arabic.
17
Chapter 1: You Already Know a Little Arabic

Speaking Arabic Like a Native
In this section, I share a couple of tricks to help you focus on pronunciation
of difficult letters that, if you can master, are sure to make you sound like a
native speaker! Here are some difficult letters and some related words you
should familiarize yourself with:
 Haa’: Hamraa’ (hahm-raah; red); Hassan (hah-san; man’s name); Hiwaar
(hee-war; conversation); Haziin (hah-zeen; sad)
 ‘ayn: ‘ajiib (ah-jeeb; amazing); ‘aziima (ah-zee-mah; determination);
‘ariiD (ah-reed; wide)
 qaaf: qif (kee-f; stop); qird (kee-red; monkey); qaws (kah-wes; bow)
 ghayn: ghaDbaan (rad-bahn; angry); ghurfa (goor-fah; room); ghadan
(rah-dan; tomorrow)
The difference between native Arabic speakers and nonnatives is enuncia-
tion. If you can enunciate your letters clearly — particularly the more difficult
ones — you’ll sound like you’re fluent! Practice these words over and over
until you feel comfortable repeating them really quickly and very distinctly.
With practice, you’ll sound more like a native and less like someone who’s
just trying to pick up the language! Plus, memorizing these words not only
helps with your pronunciation but also helps build your vocabulary!
Addressing Arabic Transcription
The transcription I use in this book is a widely used and universally recog-
nized method of transcribing Arabic to English. Students of Arabic across the
United States and around the world use this method. It’s very helpful for
beginners because it allows you to speak the language without actually know-
ing how to read Arabic script.
In the transcription method used in this book, every letter in Arabic is repre-
sented by a letter in Roman script. It’s important to note that this method is
case-sensitive, which means that a lowercase Roman letter represents a dif-
ferent letter in the Arabic script than a capital Roman letter.
Transcription is a very helpful tool for beginners, but it’s recommended that
intermediate and advanced students of Arabic master the fundamentals of
the Arabic script.

guage, from the basic parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, articles, and verbs)
to instructions on how to build both simple and descriptive sentences using
common regular and irregular verbs. In addition, I introduce prepositions,
demonstratives, and other parts of speech that will help you create phrases
and sentences and, in general, express yourself in Arabic.
As you work through different chapters and sections of Arabic For Dummies,

back to this chapter and review the grammar details that apply to your ques-
tion. You’ll be all set!
Introducing Nouns, Adjectives,
and Articles
Nouns and adjectives are two of the most essential elements in any language.
Nouns in Arabic, much like in English and other Romance languages, are
the parts of speech used to name a person, place, thing, quality, or action.

Adjectives, on the other hand, are the parts of speech that modify nouns.
Although nouns and adjectives go hand in hand, the best way to understand
how they work in Arabic is to address each one separately.
Getting a grip on nouns
In Arabic, every noun has a masculine, feminine, singular, and plural form.
Table 2-1 lists some common Arabic nouns. You’ll notice that I’ve listed both
singular and plural forms of some nouns as well as masculine (M) and femi-
nine (F) forms of others.

Notice that the masculine forms of the adjectives in Table 2-2 are manipulated
slightly to achieve the feminine adjective forms; essentially, all you do is add
the suffix -a to the masculine adjective to obtain its feminine form. This rule
applies to all regular adjective forms.
However, in addition to the regular adjective forms, another category of
adjectives exists in which the masculine and feminine forms are completely
different from each other. This is the irregular adjective form.
Fortunately, all irregular adjectives fall in the same category: color words;
and every color word is an irregular adjective. Put simply, ‘alwaan (al-wan;
colors) in Arabic are all irregular adjectives because the masculine color
form is radically different than its feminine version. Table 2-3 lists the most
common irregular adjectives.

Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

Every lawn (lah-wen; color) in Table 2-3 (as well as the lawn I didn’t have
space to list) must agree in gender with the noun it describes.
One of the biggest differences between adjective and noun interactions in the
English and Arabic languages is that nouns in Arabic come before the adjec-
tives. In English, nouns always come after their adjectives.
Discovering definite and indefinite articles
(and the sun and moon)
A common trait that nouns and adjectives share in the Arabic language is
that both can be modified using definite article prefixes. To refresh your
memory, an article is a part of speech that you use to indicate nouns or adjec-
tives and specify their applications. In English, there are two types of articles:
indefinite and definite articles. The indefinite articles in English are “a” and
“an,” such as in “a book” or “an umbrella.” The definite article is the word
“the,” as in “the book” or “the umbrella.”
Unlike English, Arabic has no outright indefinite article; instead, the indefinite
article in Arabic is always implied. For example, when you say kitaab (kee-
tab; book), you mean both “book” and “a book.” Similarly, madrasa (mad-rah-
sah; school) means both “school” and “a school.” However, Arabic does
employ a definite article, which is the prefix you attach to either the noun or
the adjective you want to define.
The rule
The definite article in Arabic is the prefix al-. When you want to define a noun
or adjective, you simply attach this prefix to the word. For example, “the
book” is al-kitaab, and “the school” is al-madrasa.
The inevitable exceptions
In the examples al-kitaab and al-madrasa, the prefix al- retains its original
form. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes, the “l” in the
prefix al- drops off and is replaced by a letter similar to the first letter of the
word being defined. For example, the word nuur (noor) means “light” in
Arabic. If you want to say “the light,” you may assume that you simply attach
the prefix al- and get al-nuur. However, that’s not quite right. Instead, the
appropriate way of saying “the light” in Arabic is an-nuur (ah-noor), where
you replace the “l” in al- with the first letter of the definite word, which in this
case is “n.” Another example of this definite article exception is the word
SabaaH (sah-bah), which means “morning.” When you define it, the resulting
word is aS-SabaaH (ah-sah-bah; the morning) and not al-SabaaH.

So how do you know whether to use al- or another definite article prefix
format? The answer’s actually quite simple and has something to do with a
really cool concept. Every single letter in Arabic falls into one of two cate-
gories: sun letters and moon letters. Put simply, every word that begins with
a moon letter gets the prefix al-, and every word that begins with a sun letter
gets the prefix a- followed by its sun letter. Table 2-4 lists all the sun letters.
Every other letter in Arabic is automatically a moon letter.

Understanding the interaction between
nouns and adjectives
Nouns and adjectives go hand in hand. In this section, I show you how you can
manipulate nouns and adjectives to create little phrases. Recall that unlike in
the English language, nouns in Arabic always come before the adjective.
You can create three types of phrases by manipulating nouns and adjectives.
This section examines the ways you can pair up nouns and adjectives to
create definite and indefinite phrases. (Later in the chapter, I show you how
to create a complete sentence by simply using a noun and an adjective.)
Indefinite phrases
One of the most important things to remember about nouns and adjectives
in Arabic is that they can be both defined and undefined using the definite
article prefix al-. Hence, to create an indefinite phrase, all you do is take an
undefined noun and add to it an undefined adjective. For example, to say “a
26
Part I: Getting Started

big book” or “big book,” you add the adjective kabiir (kah-beer; big) to the
noun kitaab (kee-tab; book). So the phrase kitaab kabiir means “a big book”
in Arabic. Here are some other examples of indefinite phrases featuring unde-
fined nouns and adjectives:
 walad Tawiil (wah-lad tah-weel; a tall boy)
 bint jamiila (bee-net jah-mee-lah; a pretty girl)
 rajul qawiiy (rah-jool kah-wee; a strong man)
 ‘imra’a laTiifa (eem-rah-ah lah-tee-fah; a nice woman)
 madrasa Saghiira (mad-rah-sah sah-gee-rah; a small school)
 Taawila Hamraa’ (tah-wee-lah ham-rah; a red table)
Notice that the adjectives agree with their corresponding nouns in gender.
For example, you say bint jamiila and not bint jamiil.
Adding more descriptive words to the noun is very simple: Because adjec-
tives follow the noun in Arabic, you just add an extra adjective and you’re
done! But don’t forget to add the conjunction wa (wah; and) between the
adjectives. Check out some examples:
 walad Tawiil wa kabiir (wah-lad tah-weel wah kah-beer; a tall and big boy)
 bint Tawiila wa jamiila (bee-net tah-wee-lah wah jah-mee-lah; a tall and
pretty girl)
 rajul qawiiy wa sarii’ (rah-jool kah-wee wah sah-reeh; a strong and
fast man)
 ‘imra’a laTiifa wa qawiiya (eem-rah-ah lah-tee-fah wah kah-wee-yah; a
nice and strong woman)
 madrasa Saghiira wa bayDaa’ (mad-rah-sah sah-gee-rah wah bay-dah; a
small and white school)
 Taawila Hamraa’ wa qaSiira (tah-wee-lah ham-rah wah kah-see-rah; a red
and short table)
Definite phrases
The biggest difference between creating an indefinite phrase and a definite
phrase is the use of the definite article prefix al-. Both noun and adjective must
be defined using the definite article prefix. For example, to say “the big book,”
you say al-kitaab al-kabiir. Here are some examples of definite phrases:
 al-walad aT-Tawiil (al-wah-lad ah-tah-weel; the big boy)
 al-bint al-jamiila (al-bee-net al-jah-mee-lah; the pretty girl)
 ar-rajul al-qawiiy (ah-rah-jool al-kay-wee; the strong man)
27
Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

 al-‘imra’a al-laTiifa (al-eem-rah-ah ah-lah-tee-fah; the nice woman)
 al-madrasa aS-Saghiira (al-mad-rah-sah ah-sah-gee-rah; the small school)
 aT-Taawila al-Hamraa’ (ah-tah-wee-lah al-ham-rah; the red table)
Using similar patterns, you can create a defined phrase using multiple adjec-
tives. Just like in indefinite phrases, make sure you use the conjunction wa in
between adjectives:
 al-walad aT-Tawiil wa al-kabiir (al-wah-lad ah-tah-weel wah al-kah-beer;
the tall and big boy)
 al-bint aT-Tawiila wa al-jamiila (al-bee-net ah-tah-wee-lah wah al-jah-mee-
lah; the tall and pretty girl)
 ar-rajul al-qawiiy wa as-sarii’ (ah-rah-jool al-kah-wee wah ah-sah-reeh;
the strong and fast man)
 al-‘imra’a al-laTiifa wa al-qawiiya (al-eem-rah-ah al-lah-tee-fah wah al-
kah-wee-yah; the nice and strong woman)
 al-madrasa aS-Saghiira wa al-bayDaa’ (al-mad-rah-sah ah-sah-gee-rah
wah al-bay-dah; the small and white school)
 aT-Taawila al-Hamraa’ wa al-qaSiira (ah-tah-wee-lah al-ham-rah wah al-
kah-see-rah; the red and short table)
Creating Simple, Verb-Free Sentences
There are two ways to form sentences in Arabic: You can manipulate definite
and indefinite nouns and adjectives, or you can pull together nouns, adjec-
tives, and verbs. In Arabic, it’s possible to create a complete sentence with a
subject, object, and verb without actually using a verb! This concept may
seem a little strange at first, but this section helps you quickly see the logic
and reasoning behind such a structure.
To be or not to be: Sentences without verbs
Before you can construct verb-free sentences, you need to know that there’s
actually no “to be” verb in the Arabic language. The verb “is/are” as a proper
verb simply doesn’t exist. That’s not to say that you can’t create an “is/are”
sentence in Arabic — you can. “Is/are” sentences are created without the use
of an actual verb. In other words, you create “to be” sentences by manipulat-
ing indefinite and definite nouns and adjectives, similar to what I cover in the
section “Understanding the interaction between nouns and adjectives” earlier
in this chapter.
28
Part I: Getting Started

When you put an indefinite noun with an indefinite adjective, you create an
indefinite phrase. Similarly, when you add a definite adjective to a definite
noun, you end up with a definite phrase. So what happens when you combine
a definite noun with an indefinite adjective? This combination — defined
noun and undefined adjective — produces an “is/are” sentence similar to
what you get when you use the verb “to be” in English.
For example, take the defined noun al-kitaab (the book) and add to it the
indefinite adjective kabiir (big). The resulting phrase is al-kitaab kabiir,
which means “The book is big.” Here are some more examples to illustrate
the construction of “is/are” sentences:
 al-walad mariiD. (al-wah-lad mah-reed; The boy is sick.)
 al-bint SaHiiHa. (al-bee-net sah-hee-hah; The girl is healthy.)
 as-sayyaara khadraa’. (ah-sah-yah-rah kad-rah; The car is green.)
 aT-Taaliba dakiiya. (ah-tah-lee-bah dah-kee-yah; The student is smart.) (F)
 al-mudarris qaSiir. (al-moo-dah-rees kah-seer; The teacher is short.) (M)
 al-‘ustaadh Tawiil. (al-oos-taz tah-weel; The professor is tall.) (M)
If you want to use additional adjectives in these verb-free sentences, you
simply add the conjunction wa. Here are some examples of “is/are” sentences
with multiple adjectives:
 al-walad mariiD wa Da’iif. (al-wah-lad mah-reed wah dah-eef; The boy is
sick and weak.)
 al-bint SaHiiHa wa qawiiya. (al-bee-net sah-hee-hah wah kah-wee-yah;
The girl is healthy and strong.)
 as-sayyaara khadraa’ wa sarii’a. (ah-sah-yah-rah kad-rah wah sah-ree-ah;
The car is green and fast.)
 aT-Taaliba dakiiya wa laTiifa. (ah-tah-lee-bah dah-kee-yah wah lah-tee-
fah; The student is smart and nice.) (F)
 al-mudarris qaSiir wa dakiiy. (al-moo-dah-rees kah-seer wah dah-kee;
The teacher is short and smart.) (M)
 al-‘ustaadh Tawiil wa Sa’b. (al-oos-taz tah-weel wah sahb; The professor
is tall and difficult.) (M)
This construct is fairly flexible, and if you change the nature of one of the
adjectives, you radically alter the meaning of the jumla (joom-lah; sentence).
For instance, the examples all show a defined noun with two indefinite adjec-
tives. What happens when you mix things up and add an indefinite noun to an
indefinite adjective and a definite adjective?
29
Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

Consider the example al-bint SaHiiHa wa qawiiya (The girl is healthy and
strong). Keep al-bint as a definite noun but change the indefinite adjective
SaHiiHa into its definite version, aS-SaHiiHa; also, drop the wa, and keep
qawiiya as an indefinite adjective. The resulting phrase is al-bint aS-SaHiiHa
qawiiya, which means “The healthy girl is strong.”
You can grasp what’s going on here by dividing the terms into clauses: The first
clause is the definite noun/definite adjective combination al-bint aS-SaHiiHa
(the healthy girl); the second clause is the indefinite adjective qawiiya
(strong). Combining these clauses is the same as combining a definite noun
with an indefinite adjective — the result is an “is/are” sentence. Here are more
examples to help clear up any confusion you have regarding this concept:
 al-walad al-mariiD Da’iif. (al-wah-lad al-mah-reed dah-eef; The sick boy
is weak.)
 as-sayyaara al-khadraa’ sarii’a. (ah-sah-yah-rah al-kad-rah sah-ree-ah; The
green car is fast.)
 aT-Taaliba ad-dakiiya laTiifa. (ah-tah-lee-bah ah-dah-kee-yah lah-tee-fah;
The smart student is nice.) (F)
 al-mudarris al-qaSiir dakiiy. (al-moo-dah-rees al-kah-seer dah-kee; The
short teacher is smart.) (M)
 al-‘ustaadh aT-Tawiil Sa’b. (al-oos-taz ah-tah-weel sahb; The tall profes-
sor is difficult.) (M)
Notice that a simple change in the definite article changes the meaning of the
phrase or sentence. For example, when the noun is defined and both adjec-
tives are indefinite, you create an “is” sentence, as in “The boy is big.” On the
other hand, when both noun and adjective are defined, the adjective affects
the noun directly, and you get “the big boy.”
Building sentences with 
common prepositions
In grammatical terms, prepositions are words or small phrases that indicate a
relationship between substantive and other types of words, such as adjec-
tives, verbs, nouns, or other substantives. In both English and Arabic, prepo-
sitions are parts of speech that are essential in the formation of sentences.
You can add them to “is/are” sentences to give them more specificity. Table
2-6 lists the most common prepositions you’re likely to use in Arabic.

girl is in front of the school.)

 al-walad al-laTiif ma’a al-mudarris. (al-wah-lad ah-lah-teef mah-ah al-
moo-dah-rees; The nice boy is with the teacher.)
In addition, you can use multiple adjectives with both the subject and object
nouns:
 al-‘imra’a al-jamiila fii as-sayyaara as-sarii’a. (al-eem-rah-ah al-jah-mee-lah
fee ah-sah-yah-rah ah-sah-ree-ah; The beautiful woman is in the fast car.)
 al-mudarissa ad-dakiyya ‘amaama al-madrasa al-bayDaa’. (al-moo-dah-

teacher is in front of the white school.) (F)
 al-kursiiy aS-Saghiir waraa’a aT-Taawila al-kabiira. (al-koor-see ah-sah-
geer wah-rah-ah ah-tah-wee-lah al-kah-bee-rah; The small chair is behind
the big table.)
Using demonstratives and 
forming sentences
A demonstrative is the part of speech that you use to indicate or specify a
noun that you’re referring to. Common demonstratives in English are the
words “this” and “that.” In English, most demonstratives are gender-neutral,
meaning that they can refer to nouns that are both feminine and masculine.
In Arabic, however, some demonstratives are gender-neutral whereas others
are gender-specific.
How do you know whether a demonstrative is gender-neutral or gender-
specific? Here’s the short answer: If a demonstrative refers to a number of
objects (such as “those” or “these”), it’s gender-neutral and may be used for
both masculine and feminine objects. If, on the other hand, you’re using a sin-
gular demonstrative (“this” or “that”), it must be in agreement with the
gender of the object being singled out.
Following are demonstratives in the singular format:
 haadhaa (hah-zah; this) (M)
 haadhihi (hah-zee-hee; this) (F)
 dhaalika (zah-lee-kah; that) (M)
 tilka (teel-kah; that) (F)
32
Part I: Getting Started

Here are the plural demonstratives, which are gender-neutral:
 haa’ulaa’i (hah-oo-lah-ee; these)
 ‘ulaa’ika (oo-lah-ee-kah; those)
You can combine demonstratives with both definite and indefinite nouns and
adjectives. For example, to say “this boy,” add the definite noun al-walad
(boy) to the demonstrative haadhaa (this; M); because demonstratives
always come before the nouns they identify, the resulting phrase is haadhaa
al-walad. Here are more examples of this construct:
 haadhihi al-bint (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net; this girl)
 ‘ulaa’ika al-banaat (oo-lah-ee-kah al-bah-nat; those girls)
 haa’ulaa’i al-‘awlaad (hah-oo-lah-ee al-aw-lad; these boys)
 tilka al-‘ustaadha (teel-kah al-oos-tah-zah; that professor) (F)
 dhaalika al-kitaab (zah-lee-kah al-kee-tab; that book)
When you use a demonstrative, which is, in essence, a definite article, the
meaning of the phrase changes depending on whether the object is defined
or undefined. When a demonstrative is followed by a defined noun, you get a
definite clause, as in the examples in the preceding list. However, when you
attach an indefinite noun to a demonstrative, the result is an “is/are” sen-
tence. For instance, if you add the demonstrative haadhaa to the indefinite
subject noun walad, you get haadhaa walad (hah-zah wah-lad; This is a boy).
Using the examples from the preceding list, I show you what happens when
you drop the definite article from the subject noun in a demonstrative clause:
 haadhihi bint. (hah-zee-hee bee-net; This is a girl.)
 ‘ulaa’ika banaat. (oo-lah-ee-kah bah-nat; Those are girls.)
 haa’ulaa’i ‘awlaad. (hah-oo-lah-ee aw-lad; These are boys.)
 tilka ‘ustaadha. (teel-kah oos-tah-zah; That is a professor.) (F)
 dhaalika kitaab. (zah-lee-kah kee-tab; That is a book.)
When you combine a demonstrative clause with a definite subject noun and
an indefinite adjective, the resulting phrase is a more descriptive “is/are” 
sentence:
 haadhihi al-bint jamiila. (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net jah-mee-lah; This girl is
pretty.)
 ‘ulaa’ika al-banaat Tawiilaat. (oo-lah-ee-kah al-bah-nat tah-wee-lat; Those
girls are tall.)
 tilka al-madrasa kabiira. (teel-kah al-mad-rah-sah kah-bee-rah; That
school is big.)
33
Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

Conversely, when you combine a demonstrative clause with a definite subject
noun and a definite adjective, you get a regular demonstrative phrase:
 haadhaa ar-rajul al-jamiil (hah-zah ah-rah-jool al-jah-meel; that hand-
some man)
 dhaalika al-kitaab al-‘ajiib (zah-lee-kah al-kee-tab al-ah-jeeb; that amaz-
ing book)
 tilka al-madiina aS-Saghiira (teel-kah al-mah-dee-nah ah-sah-gee-rah; that
small city)
Forming “to be” sentences using 
personal pronouns
Every language has personal pronouns, the parts of speech that stand in for
people, places, things, or ideas. Arabic is no different, except that personal
pronouns in Arabic are a lot more comprehensive and specific than personal
pronoun structures in other languages, such as English. Table 2-7 presents all
the major personal pronouns in the Arabic language.
In the translation and conjugation tables in this section and throughout
Arabic For Dummies, in addition to singular and plural denotations, you see a
form labeled dual. This number form, which describes a pair or two of an
item, doesn’t exist in English.

In addition to the personal pronouns common in English and other lan-
guages, Arabic makes a gender distinction with “you” in the singular and mas-
culine forms. Furthermore, Arabic includes special pronouns reserved for
describing two items (no more, no less). So all in all, personal pronouns in
Arabic may describe one thing, two things, and three or more things.
The personal pronoun always comes before the predicate noun that it desig-
nates, and it also creates an “is/are” sentence. For instance, when you say
hiya bint (hee-yah bee-net), you mean “She is a girl.” Similarly, huwa walad
(hoo-wah wah-lad) means “He is a boy.” The meaning changes slightly when
the subject noun is defined. For example, hiya al-bint means “She is the girl,”
and huwa al-walad means “He is the boy.” Here are some more examples to
familiarize you with this concept:
 ‘anaa rajul. (ah-nah rah-jool; I am a man.)
 ‘anaa ar-rajul. (ah-nah ah-rah-jool; I am the man.)
 hum ‘awlaad. (hoom aw-lad; They are boys.)
 hiya al-’imra’a. (hee-yah al-eem-rah-ah; She is the woman.)

Creating negative “to be” sentences
Although Arabic doesn’t have a “to be” regular verb to create “I am” or “you
are” phrases, it does have a verb you use to say “I am not” or “you are not.”
This special irregular verb laysa (lay-sah) creates negative “to be” sentences.

“To be” in the past tense
Arabic’s verb for “was/were” (in other words, “to be” in the past tense) is
kaana (kah-nah; was/were). Similar to the negative form of “to be,” the past
form is an irregular verb form conjugated using all the personal pronouns.

Working with Verbs
You’ll be very pleased to know that verb tenses in Arabic, when compared to
other languages, are fairly straightforward. Basically, you only need to be
concerned with two proper verb forms: the past and the present. A future
verb tense exists, but it’s a derivative of the present tense that you achieve
by attaching a prefix to the present tense of the verb.
In this section, I tell you everything you need to know about ‘af’aal (af-al;
verbs) in Arabic! I examine the past tense followed by the present and future
tenses, and then I show you irregular verb forms for all three tenses.
Digging up the past tense
The structural form of the past tense is one of the easiest grammatical struc-
tures in the Arabic language. Basically, every regular verb that’s conjugated
in the past tense follows a very strict pattern. First, you refer to all regular
verbs in the past tense using the huwa (hoo-wah; he) personal pronoun.
Second, the overwhelming majority of verbs in huwa form in the past tense
have three consonants that are accompanied by the same vowel: the fatHa
(fat-hah). The fatHa creates the “ah” sound.
For example, the verb “wrote” in the past tense is kataba (kah-tah-bah); its
three consonants are “k,” “t,” and “b.” Here are some common verbs you may
use while speaking Arabic:
 ‘akala (ah-kah-lah; ate)
 fa’ala (fah-ah-lah; did)
 dhahaba (zah-hah-bah; went)
 qara’a (kah-rah-ah; read)
 ra’a (rah-ah; saw)
The following table shows the verb kataba (kah-tah-bah; wrote) conjugated
using all the personal pronouns. Note that the first part of the verb remains
constant; only its suffix changes depending on the personal pronoun used.

Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

Compare the conjugations of darasa and kataba and you probably see a clear
pattern emerge: Every personal pronoun has a corresponding suffix used to
conjugate and identify the verb form in its specific tense. Table 2-8 outlines
these specific suffixes.

Anytime you come across a regular verb you want to conjugate in the past
tense, use these verb suffixes with the corresponding personal pronouns.
At this stage, you should know that not all regular verbs in the past tense
have three consonants. Some regular verbs have more than three conso-
nants, such as:
 tafarraja (tah-fah-rah-jah; watched)
 takallama (tah-kah-lah-mah; spoke)
Even though these verbs have more than three consonants, they’re still consid-
ered regular verbs. To conjugate them, you keep the first part of the word con-
stant and only change the last consonant of the word using the corresponding
suffixes to match the personal pronouns. To get a better sense of this conver-
sion, take a look at the verb takallama (spoke) conjugated in the past tense.
Notice that the first part of the word stays the same; only the ending changes.

When you know how to conjugate verbs in the past tense, your sentence-
building options are endless. Here are some simple sentences that combine
nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the past tense:
 ‘al-walad dhahaba ‘ilaa al-madrasa. (al-wah-lad zah-hah-bah ee-lah al-
mad-rah-sah; The boy went to the school.)
 al-bint takallamat fii al-qism. (al-bee-net tah-kah-lah-mat fee al-kee-sem;
The girl spoke in the classroom.)
 ‘akalnaa Ta’aam ladhiidh. (ah-kal-nah tah-am lah-zeez; We ate delicious
food.)
 dhahaba ar-rajul ‘ilaa al-jaami’a fii as-sayaara. (zah-hah-bah ah-rah-jool
ee-lah al-jah-mee-ah fee ah-sah-yah-rah; The man went to the school in
the car.)
Examining the present tense
Conjugating verbs in the past tense is relatively straightforward, but conjugat-
ing verbs in the present tense is a bit trickier. Instead of changing only the
ending of the verb, you must also alter its beginning. In other words, you need
to be familiar not only with the suffix but also the prefix that corresponds to
each personal pronoun.
41
Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

To illustrate the difference between past and present tense, the verb kataba
(wrote) is conjugated as yaktubu (yak-too-boo; to write), whereas the verb
darasa (studied) is yadrusu (yad-roo-soo; to study).
Here’s the verb yaktubu (to write) conjugated using all the personal pro-
nouns. Notice how both the suffixes and prefixes change in the present tense.

Aside from prefixes and suffixes, another major difference between the past
and present tenses in Arabic is that every verb in the present tense has a domi-
nant vowel that’s unique and distinctive. For example, the dominant vowel in
yaktubu is a damma (dah-mah; “ooh” sound). However, in the verb yaf’alu
(yaf-ah-loo; to do), the dominant vowel is the fatHa (fat-hah; “ah” sound). This
means that when you conjugate the verb yaf’alu using the personal pronoun
‘anaa, you say ‘anaa ‘af’alu and not ‘anaa ‘af’ulu. For complete coverage of
Arabic vowels (damma, fatHa, and kasra), check out Chapter 1.
The dominant vowel is always the middle vowel. Unfortunately, there’s no
hard rule you can use to determine which dominant vowel is associated with
each verb. The best way to identify the dominant vowel is to look up the verb
in the qaamuus (kah-moos; dictionary).
In this list, I divided up some of the most common Arabic verbs according to
their dominant vowels:
 damma
• yaktubu (yak-too-boo; to write)
• yadrusu (yad-roo-soo; to study)
• ya’kulu (yah-koo-loo; to eat)
• yaskunu (yas-koo-noo; to live)
 fatHa
• yaf’alu (yaf-ah-loo; to do)
• yaqra’u (yak-rah-oo; to read)
• yadhhabu (yaz-hah-boo; to go)
• yaftaHu (yaf-tah-hoo; to open)
43
Chapter 2: The Nitty-Gritty: Basic Arabic Grammar

 kasra
• yarji’u (yar-jee-oo; to return)
• ya’rifu (yah-ree-foo; to know)
When you conjugate a verb in the present tense, you must do two things:
1. Identify the dominant vowel that will be used to conjugate the verb
using all personal pronouns.
2. Isolate the prefix and suffix that correspond to the appropriate per-
sonal pronouns.
Peeking into the future tense
Although Arabic grammar has a future tense, you’ll be glad to know that the
tense has no outright verb structure. Rather, you achieve the future tense by
adding the prefix sa- to the existing present tense form of the verb. For exam-
ple, yaktubu means “to write.” Add the prefix sa- to yaktubu and you get
sayaktubu, which means “he will write.”
To illustrate the future tense, here’s the verb yaktubu conjugated in the
future tense.

Examining irregular verb forms
Arabic uses both regular and irregular verbs. Regular verbs have a specific
pattern and follow a specific set of rules, but irregular verbs do not. Because
these irregular forms include some of the most common verbs in the lan-
guage (such as “to buy,” “to sell,” and “to give”), you should examine them
separately. This section looks at some of the most common irregular verbs in
the Arabic language.
The verb “to sell” is conjugated as baa’a (bah-ah; sold) in the past tense. In
the conjugation that follows, notice that unlike regular verbs, baa’a has only
two consonants (the baa’ and the ‘ayn).

n Arabic culture, you can’t underestimate the importance of greetings.
First impressions in the Middle East are crucial, and knowing both the
verbal and nonverbal nuances of greeting people is one of the most impor-
tant aspects of mastering Arabic.
In this chapter, I show you how to greet people in Arabic, how to respond to
basic greetings, and how to interact with native Arabic speakers. You find out
when it’s appropriate to use formal and informal terms, how to make small
talk, and how to introduce yourself. HaDHan sa’iidan! (had-dan sa-ee-dan;
Good luck!)
Greetings!
In Arabic, you have to choose between formal and informal ways of greeting
people. The greeting you use depends on whom you’re addressing: If you’re
greeting someone you don’t know for the very first time, you must use the
more formal greetings. On the other hand, if you’re greeting an old family
friend or a colleague you know well, feel free to use the more informal forms
of greeting. If you’re not sure which form to use, you’re better off going
formal. I cover both types of greetings as well as some other handy pleas-
antries in this section.

You say hello . . .
The formal way of greeting someone in Arabic is ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum (ass-sa-
laam-ou a-lai-koum). Even though it translates into English as “hello,” it liter-
ally means “May peace be upon you.” Arabic is a very poetic language, so
you’re going to have to get used to the fact that a lot of the phrases used in
everyday life are very descriptive!
Using ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum is appropriate when
 You’re greeting a potential business partner.
 You’re at a formal event, dinner, or gala.
 You’re meeting someone for the first time.
The most common reply to ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum is wa ‘alaykum ‘as-salaam
(wa a-lai-koum ass-sa-laam; and upon you peace).
The phrase ‘ahlan wa sahlan (ahel-an wah sah-lan) is a very informal way of
greeting a person or group of people. Translated into English, it resembles
the more informal “hi” as opposed to “hello.” When someone says ‘ahlan wa
sahlan, you should also reply ‘ahlan wa sahlan.
Using the informal ‘ahlan wa sahlan is appropriate when
 You’re greeting an old friend.
 You’re greeting a family member.
 You’re greeting someone at an informal gathering, such as a family lunch.
Although ‘ahlan wa sahlan is one of the friendliest and most informal greet-
ings in Arabic, you can actually greet someone you know very well, such as a
close friend or family member, by simply saying ‘ahlan! Because it’s the most
informal way of greeting someone in Arabic, make sure that you use ‘ahlan
only with people you’re very comfortable with; otherwise you may appear
disrespectful even if you’re trying to be friendly! (Nonverbal signs may also
convey disrespect; see the sidebar “Sending the right nonverbal message.”)
Kinship, family relations, and tribal connections are extraordinarily impor-
tant to people from the Middle East. In the early period of Islam when traders
and nomads roamed the Arabian Peninsula, they identified themselves as
members of one nation — the ‘ahl al-islaam (ah-el al-is-laam; kinship of
Islam). They greeted each other by identifying themselves as part of the ‘ahl
(ah-el; kin) by saying ‘ahlan. This is how the phrase ‘ahlan wa sahlan origi-
nated, although today it’s simply a friendly way of greeting people.

. . . I say goodbye
Saying goodbye in Arabic is a little more straightforward than greetings
because, even though there are different ways of saying goodbye, they aren’t
divided into formal or informal options. Here are the most common ways of
saying goodbye in Arabic:
 ma’a as-salaama (ma-a ass-sa-laa-ma; go with peace, or goodbye)
 ‘ilaa al-liqaa’ (ee-laa al-li-kaa; until next time)
 ‘ilaa al-ghad (ee-laa al-gad; see you tomorrow)
How are you doing?
After you’ve greeted someone by saying ‘ahlan wa sahlan or ‘as-salaamu
‘alaykum, the next part of an Arabic greeting is asking how the person’s doing.
The most common way of asking someone how he’s doing is kayf al-Haal?
(ka-yef al-haal). When you break down the phrase, you discover that Haal
means “health” and kayf means “how.” (The prefix al- attached to Haal is a
definite article, so al-Haal means “the health.”) Therefore, the phrase kayf al-
Haal? literally means “How is the health?,” but for all intents and purposes,
you can translate it into English as “How are you?”
kayf al-Haal is a gender-neutral phrase for asking people how they’re doing,
but you should also be aware of gender-defined greeting terms, which are
derivatives of the kayf al-Haal phrase:
 When addressing a man, use kayf Haaluka (ka-yef haa-lou-ka).
 When addressing a woman, use kayf Haaluki (ka-yef haa-lou-kee).
Another variation of kayf al-Haal is kayf Haalak? (ka-yef haa-lak; How is your
health?). You can use either greeting, but kayf al-Haal is preferred when
you’re meeting someone for the first time because kayf Haalak is a bit more
personal and informal.
I’m doing well!
When someone asks you how you’re doing, if you’re doing just fine, the typi-
cal response is al-Hamdu li-llah (al-ham-dou lee-lah). al-Hamdu li-llah liter-
ally means “Praise to God,” but in this context, it translates to “I’m doing
well.” Typically, after you say al-Hamdu li-llah, you follow up by saying
shukran (shouk-ran; thank you). As you expose yourself to more and more
51
Chapter 3: ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum!: Greetings and Introductions

Arabic phrases and terms, you’ll notice that the reference to Allah is wide-
spread. Modern Arabic evolved from the Koran, and many everyday phrases
still contain religious references. That’s why a phrase as mundane as “I’m
doing well” takes on religious overtones.
A greeting wouldn’t be complete if both sides didn’t address each other. So
after you say al-Hamdu li-llah, shukran, you need to ask the other person
how he or she is doing:
 If you’re speaking with a man, you say wa ‘anta kayf al-Haal (wa an-ta
ka-yef al-haal; And you, how are you?).
 If you’re speaking with a woman, you say wa ‘anti kayf al-Haal (wa an-
tee ka-yef al-haal; And you, how are you?).

Making Introductions
Carrying on a conversation with someone you haven’t exchanged names with
is awkward, to say the least. But it’s an awkwardness that’s easy enough to
remedy when you know a few key phrases. This section explains how to ask
people for their names and how to share your name using the possessive
form, which may be one of the easiest grammar lessons and linguistic con-
cepts you’ll encounter in Arabic!
Asking “What’s your name?”
After you go through the basic greeting procedure, which is covered in the pre-
ceding section, you’re ready to ask people their names. This task is relatively
easy given that you only need to know two words: ‘ism (name) and maa
(what). If you’re addressing a man, you ask maa ‘ismuka? (maa ees-moo-ka;
What’s your name?) (M). When addressing a woman, you ask maa ‘ismuki?
(maa ees-moo-kee; What’s your name?) (F).
If you say maa ‘ismuk without using the suffixes –a or –i at the end of ‘ismuk,
you’re actually using a gender-neutral form, which is perfectly acceptable.
You can address both men and women by saying maa ‘ismuk? (maa ees-
mook; What’s your name?) (GN).

Sending the right nonverbal message
Although familiarizing yourself with the lan-
guage is the first step to interacting with people
from the Middle East, you also need to under-
stand some of the nonverbal signs that can be
as meaningful as words in communicating with
native speakers. For example, when shaking
someone’s hand, be sure to avoid pressing the
person’s palm with too much force. In the
United States, a firm and strong handshake is
encouraged in order to display a healthy dose
of confidence. In most Arab countries, how-
ever, a forceful handshake is viewed as an
openly hostile act! The reasoning is that you
use force against people whom you don’t con-
sider friends, so a forceful handshake indicates
that you don’t consider that person a friend.
Therefore, the most acceptable way to shake
hands in the Arab world is to present a friendly,
not-too-firm grip.

Responding with the possessive
“My name is . . .”
The possessive form is one of Arabic’s easiest grammatical lessons: All you
do is add the suffix –ii (pronounced ee) to the noun, and — voila! — you have
the possessive form of the noun. For example, to say “my name,” you add –ii
to ‘ism and get ‘ismii (ees-mee; my name). So to say “My name is Amine,” all
you say is ‘ismii amiin. It’s that simple!
Saying “It’s a pleasure to meet you!”
When someone introduces himself or herself, a polite response is tasharraf-
naa. (tah-shah-raf-nah; It’s a pleasure to meet you.) tasharrafnaa is a formal
response, whereas ‘ahlan wa sahlan (ahel-an wah sah-lan; Nice to meet you.)
is much more informal.
sharafa is the Arabic term for “honor,” which means that tasharrafnaa liter-
ally translates to “We’re honored.” In English, it’s the equivalent of “It’s a plea-
sure to meet you.”
‘ahlan wa sahlan is a phrase with a dual role: When used at the beginning of
a dialogue, it means “hi” (see the section “You say hello . . .” earlier in this
chapter for further explanation). When used right after an introduction,
you’re informally saying “Nice to meet you.”

Talking About Countries
and Nationalities
With the growing internationalism of the modern world, when you meet
someone for the first time, you may want to know what country he or she is
from. Fortunately for English speakers, the names of countries in Arabic are
very similar to their names in English. Even more good news is the fact that
the terms for nationalities are derivatives of the country names.
Asking “Where are you from?”
If you’re speaking with a man and want to ask him where he’s from, you use
the phrase min ‘ayna ‘anta (min ay-na ann-ta). Similarly, if you want to ask a
woman “Where are you from?,” you say min ‘ayna ‘anti? (min ay-na ann-tee).
If you want to ask if a man is from a certain place — for example, America —
you say hal ‘anta min ‘amriikaa? (hal ann-ta min am-ree-kaa; Are you from
America?) (M). If you’re speaking with a woman, you simply replace ‘anta
with ‘anti.
Telling where “I am from . . .”
To say “I am from . . .,” you use the preposition min (from) and the personal
pronoun ‘anaa (I/me). Therefore, “I’m from America” is ‘anaa min ‘amriikaa.
It’s that simple!
To help you both understand responses to the question “Where are you
from?” (see the preceding section) and give your own response to such ques-
tions, Table 3-1 lists the names of various countries and corresponding
nationalities in Arabic.

Arabic in Action

In this part . . . 
You get to know key words and phrases that allow you
to interact with Arabic-speaking folks in a variety of
different settings (such as in a restaurant, around town, at
the office, or even at the mall). You discover how to make
small talk and how to ask for basic information about
people you speak to, such as their names, where they’re
from, and their occupations.

k
alaam khafiif (kah-laah-m khah-feef; small talk, literally “light talk”) plays
an important role during interactions with Arabic speakers. Sometimes
you need to engage in kalaam khafiif when you meet people for the first
time; you may know their ‘ism (ee-sehm; name), but you want to find out
more about them, such as where they’re from and what they do. kalaam
khafiif allows you to find out more about the person you’re interacting with
as well as lets you tell a little bit about yourself. kalaam khafiif may also take
place between people who know each other but prefer to make small talk in
order to avoid awkward silence! Whatever the case, the ability to engage in
kalaam khafiif is important.
You need to be aware of a number of rules when you make small talk in
Arabic. Some cultural, social, and personal topics are off-limits, and you may
offend someone unnecessarily if you don’t know what topics to avoid. This
chapter explains how to make kalaam khafiif in Arabic, including how to ask
simple questions to find out more about the person or people you’re talking
to. I review how to talk about your ‘usra (oos-rah; family), your mihna (meeh-
nah; job), and your hiwaayaat (hee-waa-yat; hobbies). I also share how to
chat about aT-Taqs (aht-tah-kes; the weather). Finally, you discover key words
that will allow you to engage in kalaam khafiif like a native speaker!

Part II: Arabic in Action
Asking Key Questions
One of the best ways to start a conversation is to ask a su’aal (soo-aahl; ques-
tion). To get you started, here are some key question words in Arabic:
 man? (meh-n; Who?)
 ‘ayna? (eh-yeh-nah; Where?)
 mataa? (mah-taah; When?)
 maa? (maah; What?)
 maadhaa? (maah-zaah; What?) (used with verbs)
 lii maadhaa? (lee maah-zaah; Why?)
 kayfa? (keh-yeh-fah; How?)
 bikam? (bee-kah-m; How much?)
 kam min? (kam meen; How many?)
You may use these question words to ask more elaborate and detailed ques-
tions. Here are some examples:
 maa ‘ismuka? (maah ees-moo-kah; What’s your name?) (MS)
 maa ‘ismuki? (maah ees-moo-kee; What’s your name?) (FS)
 maa mihnatuka? (maah meeh-nah-too-kah; What do you do?; literally
“What is your job?”) (MS)
 maa mihnatuki? (maah meeh-nah-too-kee; What do you do?; literally
“What is your job?”) (FS)
 maadha taf’al? (maah-zaah tah-feh-al; What are you doing?) (MS)
 maadha taf’aliina? (maah-zaah tah-feh-alee-nah; What are you doing?) (FS)
 min ‘ayna ‘anta? (meh-n eh-yeh-nah ahn-tah; Where are you from?) (MS)
 min ‘ayna ‘anti? (meh-n eh-yeh-nah ahn-tee; Where are you from?) (FS)
 maadha yaktubu? (maah-zaah yah-keh-too-boo; What is he writing?)
 hal tuHibbu al-qiraa’a? (hal too-hee-buh al-kee-raa-ah; Do you like to
read?) (MS)
 hal haadhaa kitaabuka? (hal hah-zah kee-tah-boo-kah; Is this your book?)
 ‘ayna maHaTTatu al-qiTaar? (eh-yeh-nah mah-hah-tah-too al-kee-taar;
Where is the train station?)
 mataa satadhhab ‘ilaa al-maTaar? (mah-taah sa-taz-hab ee-laah al-mah-taar;
When did she go to the airport?)
 ‘ayna ‘aHsan maT’am? (eh-yeh-nah ah-sah-n mah-tam; Where is the best
restaurant?)

 lii maadhaa dhahabta ‘ilaa as-suuq? (lee maah-zaah za-hab-tah ee-laah
ass-sook; Why did you go to the market?) (MS)
Notice that some of the questions above refer to either masculine or feminine
subjects. When you ask a question in Arabic, you choose the gender of the
subject by modifying the gender suffix of the noun in question. For example,
kitaab (kee-tab) means “book,” but kitaabuka (kee-tah-boo-kah) means “your
book” (M), and kitaabuki (kee-tah-boo-kee) means “your book” (F). So if you
want to ask a man for his book, you use kitaabuka.

Talking About Yourself and Your Family
When you meet someone for the first time, you want to get to know a little
more about them. One of the best ways to get acquainted with the person
you’re talking to is by finding out more about his or her ‘usra (oos-rah; the
family). The ‘usra is one of the best topics of conversation because it gener-
ates a lot of interest and endless conversation. Table 4-1 lists some important
members of the ‘usra who may come up in casual conversation.

The role of family in Arab culture
The ‘usra plays a very important role in Arab life,
society, and culture, and the Arab ‘usra struc-
ture is very different than the Western family
unit. The notion of the ‘usra is much more com-
prehensive and reinforced in the Arab world
and the Middle East than it is in America or
other Western countries. The family unit most
prevalent in the West is the nuclear family —
generally comprised of two parents and their
children — but the ‘usra in the Arab world is an
extended, close-knit family network made up of
parents, children, grandparents, aunts, uncles,
and cousins.
It’s not uncommon to find an Arab household in
which children live not only with their parents
but also with their aunts and uncles, cousins,
and grandparents. In Arab culture, the idea of
the immediate family extends to second- and
even third-degree cousins! In addition, lineage
is important, and the terms for family relatives
are specifically designed to differentiate
between cousins from the mother’s side (‘ibn al-
khaal) and cousins from the father’s side (‘ibn
al-’amm). Thus, if you’re talking to an Arab about
his or her family, you can be sure that you’ll have
a lot to talk about!

Making Small Talk on the Job
You can generally find out a lot about a person based on his or her mihna
(meeh-nah; job). A lot of people identify themselves with their occupations,
so being able to make small talk about jobs is essential.
Professions in Arabic always have a gender distinction. If you want to ask
someone about his or her profession, you have two options:
 maa mihnatuka? (maah meeh-nah-too-kah; What is your job?; literally
“What do you do?”) (M)
 maa mihnatuki? (maah meeh-nah-too-kee; What is your job?; literally
“What do you do?”) (F)
 ‘ayna ta’mal? (eh-yeh-nah tah-mal; Where do you work?) (M)
 ‘ayna ta’maliina? (eh-yeh-nah tah-mah-lee-nah; Where do you work?) (F)
Table 4-2 contains some important words relating to different occupations.

Table 4-2 gives the masculine forms of professions. You’ll be pleased to know
that converting the masculine forms of professions into the feminine forms
involves simply adding a fatHa to the end of the masculine profession. For
example, to say “translator” in the feminine, you add a fatHa to muTarjim to
get muTarjima (moo-tar-jee-mah; translator) (F).

Talking About Hobbies
hiwaayaat (hee-wah-yat; hobbies) are a really great topic for kalaam khafiif.
Almost everyone has a hobby, and because a hobby, by definition, is an activ-
ity that a person is really passionate about, you can be sure that he or she
will enjoy talking about it! People really like to talk about their hobbies, so
knowing how to engage in kalaam khafiif related to hiwaayaat is important.
Here are some activities that may be considered hiwaayaat:
 raqS (rah-kes; dancing)
 ghinaa’ (ree-nah; singing)
70

 kurat al-qadam (koo-raht al-kah-dam; soccer)

Shooting the Breeze: Talking About 
the Weather
If you want to engage in kalaam khafiif, shoot the breeze, or chitchat with a
friend or stranger, talking about Taqs (tah-kes; weather) is a pretty safe topic.
In conversations about Taqs, you’re likely to use some of the following words:
71
Chapter 4: Getting to Know You: Making Small Talk

 shams (shah-mes; sun)
 maTar (mah-tar; rain)
 ra’d (rah-ed; thunder)
 barq (bah-rek; lightning)
 suHub (soo-hoob; clouds)
 Harara (hah-rah-rah; temperature)
 daraja (dah-rah-jah; degrees)
 bard (bah-red; cold)
 sukhoun (suh-koon; hot)
 ruTuuba (roo-too-bah; humidity)
 riiH (ree-eh; wind)
 ‘aaSifa (ah-tee-fah; storm)
 thalj (thah-lej; snow)
 qawsu quzaH (kah-wuh-suh koo-zah; rainbow)
If you want to express the temperature, as in “It’s x degrees,” you must use
the following construct: al-Harara (insert number) daraja. So, al-Harara 35
daraja means “It’s 35 degrees.”
Because the weather is a quasi-universal topic that interests almost every-
one, here are some expressions you can use to start talking about Taqs:
 hal sayakun maTar al-yawm? (hal sah-yah-koon mah-tar al-yah-oum; Is it
going to rain today?)
 yawm sukhoun, na’am? (yah-oum suh-koon, nah-am; Hot day, isn’t it?)
 ‘inna yahubbu al-bard faj’atan. (ee-nah yah-hoo-boo al-bah-red fah-jeh-
ah-tan; It’s gotten cold all of a sudden.)
 hal sayabqaa aT-Taqs haakadhaa kul al-usbuu’? (hal sah-yab-kah at-tah-
kes hah-kah-zah kool al-oos-boo; Will the weather remain like this all
week?)
It would be difficult to chat about the weather without mentioning the fuSuul
(fuh-sool; seasons):
 Sayf (sah-yef; summer)
 khariif (kah-reef; fall)
 shitaa’ (shee-tah; winter)
 rabii’ (rah-beeh; spring)
72
Part II: Arabic in Action

Temperatures in the majority of the Middle Eastern countries are stated in
Celsius and not Fahrenheit. If you hear someone say that al-harara 25 daraja
(al-hah-rah-rah 25 dah-rah-jah; It’s 25 degrees), don’t worry that you’re going
to freeze! They actually mean that it’s almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit. To con-
vert degrees from Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the following formula:
(Celsius × 1.8) + 32 = Degrees Fahrenheit

Talking Numbers
Knowing how to express numbers in Arabic is a basic language lesson. You’re
bound to encounter Arabic numbers in all sorts of settings, including kalaam
khafiif. For example, when you’re talking with someone about the weather,
you need to know your numbers in order to reference the temperature or
understand a reference if the other person makes one. In this section, I intro-
duce you to the Arabic ‘arqaam (ah-reh-kam; numbers). (The singular form of
‘arqaam is raqm (rah-kem; number).)
Arabic ‘arqaam are part of one of the earliest traditions of number notation.
Even though the Western world’s number system is sometimes referred to as
“Arabic numerals,” actual Arabic ‘arqaam are written differently than the ones
used in the West. One of the most important aspects of Arabic numbers  to
keep in mind is that you read them from left to right. That’s right! Even though
you read and write Arabic from right to left, you read and write Arabic num-
bers from left to right! Table 4-3 lays out the Arabic ‘arqaam from 0 to 10.

Hurray, it’s raining!
One of the happiest times of the year for people
of the Middle East is when the rain comes. After
all, these hot desert countries get very little rain-
fall. You will almost never hear anyone complain-
ing about rain in Arabic — there are no equivalent
expressions for “rain, rain, go away.” Actually, the
opposite is true! There’s a song that farmers, 
students, and children sing when the rain starts
falling: ah shta-ta-ta-ta-ta / ‘awlaad al-Harata;
Sabbi, Sabbi, Sabbi / al-’awlad fii qubbi (ah-
sheh-tah-tah-tah-tah-tah / ah-ou-lad al-hah-rah-tah; 
sah-bee, sah-bee, sah-bee / al-ah-ou-lad fee koo-
bee; Oh rain, rain, rain, rain, rain / Children of the
plowman; Pour, pour, pour / The children are in the
hood of my jellaba). A jellaba is a long, flowing
garment worn by farmers in the Middle East. It
has a big hood in which the farmer puts objects.
Of course, children can’t fit in the hood of the
jellaba, but the hood is big enough that it symbol-
izes protection against the rain. This is a happy
song that expresses people’s joy when it rains!

The ‘arqaam from ‘iHdaa ‘ashar (11) to tis’ata ‘ashar (19) are obtained by
combining a derivative form of the number ‘ashra (10) — specifically ‘ashar
(tenth) — with a derivative form of the singular number. In the case of the
‘arqaam from thalaathata ‘ashar (13) through tis’ata ‘ashar (19), all you do is
add the suffix -ta to the regular number and add the derivative form ‘ashar!
After you’re familiar with this pattern, remembering these ‘arqaam is much
easier.
75

Referring to Days and Months
When you’re engaged in kalaam khafiif, you may find that you need to refer to
certain days of the week or months. Fortunately the days of the ‘usbuu’ (ooh-
seh-booh; week) are number derivatives — that is, they’re derived from Arabic
numbers. So recognizing the roots of the words for days of the week is key:
 al-‘aHad (al-ah-had; Sunday)
 al-‘ithnayn (al-eeth-nah-yen; Monday)
 ath-thulathaa’ (ah-thoo-lah-thah; Tuesday)
 al-‘arbi’aa’ (al-ah-reh-bee-ah; Wednesday)
 al-khamiis (al-khah-mees; Thursday)
 al-jumu’a (al-joo-moo-ah; Friday)
 as-sabt (ass-sah-bet; Saturday)
76
Part II: Arabic in Action

Notice that ‘aHad (Sunday) is derived from waaHid (1); al-‘ithnayn (Monday)
from ‘ithnayn (2); ath-thulathaa’ (Tuesday) from thalaatha (3); al-‘arbi’aa’
(Wednesday) from ‘arba’a (4); and al-khamiis (Thursday) from khamsa (5). 
In the Islamic calendar, Sunday is the first day, Monday the second day, and 
so on.
al-jumu’a gets its name from jumu’a, which means “to gather;” it’s the day
when Muslims gather around the mosque and pray. Similarly, as-sabt is the
day of rest, similar to the Jewish Sabbath.
Arabs use three different types of calendars to note the passage of time.
 The Gregorian calendar is basically the same calendar as the one used
throughout the Western world.
 The Islamic calendar is partly based on the lunar cycle and has radi-
cally different names for the months than its Western counterpart.
 The lunar calendar is based entirely on the moon’s rotations and is
used to identify specific religious holidays, such as the end and begin-
ning of the holy month of Ramadan, in which Muslims fast from the
break of dawn until dusk.
Tables 4-7 and 4-8 show the ash-hur (ah-shuh-hur; months) in the Gregorian
and Islamic calendars, because they’re the most widely used calendars.

T
a’aam (tah-am; food) is a great way to explore a new culture. You can find
out a lot about a people by exploring what they eat, how they eat it, and
how they prepare it. Like in many other cultures, Ta’aam plays a central role
in Arabic culture. In this chapter, you expand your vocabulary with the
Arabic words for some popular meals and foods, and you find out how to
place an order at a restaurant and how to interact appropriately with your
waiter or waitress.
All About Meals
The three basic wajbaat (waj-bat; meals) in Arabic are:
 fuTuur (foo-toor; breakfast)
 ghidaa’ (gee-dah; lunch)
 ‘ashaa’ (ah-ashaa; dinner)
Sometimes when you’re feeling a little jaai’ (jah-eeh; hungry) but aren’t ready
for a full course wajba, you may want a small wajba khafiifa (waj-bah kah-fee-
fah; snack) instead.

Breakfast
I’m sure you’ve heard it before, but fuTuur is the most important wajba of
the day: When you start your day on a full stomach, you feel better and
accomplish more. In the mornings, I like to start my day with a cup of qahwa
(kah-wah; coffee). I usually like to drink it kaHla (kah-lah; black), but some-
times I add a little Haliib (hah-leeb; milk) and some sukkar (soo-kar; sugar) to
give it a bit of flavor. Some days, I prefer to drink shay (shay; tea) instead of
qahwa. My favorite accompaniments for my qahwa or shay are khubz (koo-
bez; bread) and mu’ajjanaat (moo-ah-jah-nat; pastries).
Here are some other things you can expect in a regular fuTuur:
 ‘asal (ah-sal; honey)
 qahwa bi Haliib (kah-wah bee hah-leeb; coffee with milk)
 qahwa bi sukkar (kah-wah bee soo-kar; coffee with sugar)
 qahwa bi Haliib wa sukkar (kah-wah bee hah-leeb wah soo-kar; coffee
with milk and sugar)
 shay bi ‘asal (shay bee ah-sel; tea with honey)
 khubz muHammar (koo-bez moo-hah-mar; toasted bread)
 khubz bi zabda (koo-bez bee zab-dah; bread with butter)
 khubz bi zabda wa ‘asal (koo-bez bee zab-dah wah ah-sal; bread with
butter and honey)
 shefanj (sheh-fanj; donuts)
 Hubuub al-fuTuur (hoo-boob al-foo-toor; breakfast cereal)
 bayD (bah-yed; eggs)
Having fuTuur fii al-manzil (foo-toor fee al-man-zeel; breakfast at home) is a
nice, relaxing way to start the day.

Having a piece of faakiha (fah-kee-hah; fruit) such as a burtuqaala (orange)
or tuffaaHa (apple) is a healthy addition to any fuTuur. Because fawaakih
(fah-wah-keeh; fruits) play an important role in any healthy meal, here are
some of the more common fawaakih:
86
Part II: Arabic in Action

 tuuta (too-tah; strawberry)
 ‘ijaaS (ee-jas; pear)
 dallaaHa (dah-lah-hah; watermelon)
 baTTiikh (bah-teek; cantaloupe)
 khawkha (kaw-kah; peach)
 ‘inab (ee-nab; grapes)
 laymoon (lay-moon; lemon)
 laymoon hindii (lay-moon heen-dee; grapefruit)
 laymoon maaliH (lay-moon mah-leeh; lime)
 al-anbaj (al-ann-baj; mango)
Lunch
Eating your fuTuur keeps you shab’aan (shab-an; satisfied) for a few hours —
time to get some work done and remain productive. Later, though, you’re
bound to get jaai’ (jah-eeh; hungry) again. Perhaps a piece of faakiha will
keep you going until it’s time for al-ghidaa’ (al-gee-dah; lunch).
al-ghidaa’ is a very important wajba. In most Middle Eastern countries, work-
ers don’t sit in their cubicles and eat their ghidaa’. Rather, most offices close
and employees get two hours or more for al-ghidaa’!
Unlike fuTuur, the Ta’aam during the ghidaa’ is quite different. Here are
some of the common Ta’aam you can expect during the ghidaa’:
 laHam (lah-ham; meat)
 laHam al-baqar (lah-ham al-bah-kar; beef)
 laHam al-ghanam (lah-ham al-gah-nam; lamb)
 laHam al-‘ajal (lah-ham al-ah-jel; veal)
 samak (sah-mak; fish)
 dajaaj (dah-jaj; chicken)
 ruz (rooz; rice)
Sometimes, your ghidaa’ may consist of a simple sandwiish (sand-weesh;
sandwich). Other times, you may prefer a nice, healthy shalada (shah-lah-dah;
salad). I’m convinced that khudar (koo-dar; vegetables) make or break the
shalada. Here are some khudar to help you make your shalada ladhiidha
(lah-zee-zah; delicious):
87
Chapter 5: This Is Delicious! Eating In and Dining Out

 khass (kass; lettuce)
 TamaaTim (tah-mah-teem; tomatoes)
 khurshuuf (koor-shoof; artichokes)
 baTaaTis (bah-tah-tees; potatoes)
 hilyoon (heel-yoon; asparagus)
 ‘afookaat (ah-foo-kat; avocado)
 qarnabiiT (kar-nah-beet; broccoli)
 qunnabiiT (koo-nah-beet; cauliflower)
 dhurra (zoo-rah; corn)
 khiyaar (kee-yar; cucumber)
 fuul (fool; beans)
 ‘ayshu al-ghuraab (ay-shoo al-goo-rab; mushrooms)
 baSla (bass-lah; onions)
 baziilya (bah-zee-lee-yah; peas)
 ‘isfaanaakh (ees-fah-nak; spinach)
In order to make a sandwiish even more delicious, add some of the following
Tawaabil (tah-wah-beel; condiments):
 SalSa min aT-TamaaTim (sal-sah meen at-tah-mah-teem; ketchup)
 khardal (kar-dal; mustard)
 miiyooniiz (mee-yoo-neez; mayonnaise)
 mukhallalaat (moo-kah-lah-lat; pickles)

The most important fi’l (fee-al; verb) you should know relating to Ta’aam is the
verb ‘akala (ah-kah-lah), which means “ate” in the maaDii. In the muDaari’, it’s

Chapter 5: This Is Delicious! Eating In and Dining Out

Dinner
‘ishaa’ (eeh-shah; dinner) is an important meal in the course of the day. In
most Arab countries, ‘ishaa’ is usually eaten very late, around 9 p.m. or even
10 p.m. Because ghidaa’ and fuTuur are the meals at which people eat a lot
and because of the traditionally late hour of ‘ishaa’, most people in the Arab
world have light meals during ‘ishaa’.
A typical ‘ishaa’ usually consists of some sort of samak (sah-mak; fish),
dajaaj (dah-jaj; chicken), or other kind of laHm (lah-hem; meat).
Enjoying a Meal at Home
Grabbing a quick bite on the go is often convenient if you have a busy sched-
ule, but there’s nothing like a home-cooked meal. This section covers the key
terms to help you prepare and set the table for a wajba ladhiida fii al-manzil
(waj-bah lah-zee-zah fee al-man-zeel; a delicious home-cooked meal)!
Here are some common items you might find in your maTbakh (mat-bak;
kitchen):
 farraan (fah-ran; oven)
 thallaaja (thah-la-jah; refrigerator)
 maghsala (mag-sah-lah; sink)
 khizaanaat (kee-zah-nat; cupboards)
 milH (mee-leh; salt)
 fulful (fool-fool; pepper)
 zayt az-zaytuun (zah-yet ah-zay-toon; olive oil)
When you’re done Tibaakha (tee-bah-kah; cooking) daakhil (dah-keel; inside)
the maTbakh, you’re ready to step into the ghurfat al-‘akel (goor-fat al-ah-kel;
dining room) and set up the Ta’aam on top of the maa’ida (mah-ee-dah;
dining table). Here are some items you may find on your maa’ida:
 ‘aS-SHaan (ass-han; plates)
 ‘aTbaaq (at-bak; dishes)
 ku’uus (koo-oos; glasses)
 ‘akwaab (ak-wab; tumblers)
 ‘awaan fiDDiyya (ah-wan fee-dee-yah; silverware)
 shawkaat (shaw-kat; forks)
92
Part II: Arabic in Action

 malaa’iq (mah-lah-eek; spoons)
 sakaakiin (sah-kah-keen; knives)
 manaadil (mah-nah-deel; napkins)
Dining Out
Going to a nice maT’am (mat-am; restaurant) is one of my favorite things to
do. I enjoy interacting with the khaadim al-maT’am (kah-deem al-mat-am;
waiter) and the khaadimat al-maT’am (kah-dee-maht al-mat-am; waitress),
and I like taking my time picking and choosing from the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam
(kah-ee-mah ah-tah-am; menu). In this section, you find out how to make your
trip to the maT’am as enjoyable as possible, from interacting with the khaadim
al-maT’am to displaying proper dining etiquette and choosing the best food
from the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam.
The dining experience in most restaurants in the Middle East, as well as in
Middle Eastern restaurants all over the world, is truly an enchanting and
magical experience. The décor is usually very ornate and sumptuous, with
oriental patterns and vivid colors adorning the rooms. The wait staff usually
wears traditional jellaba (jeh-lah-bah), which are long, flowing garments that
are pleasing to the eye, and the food is very exotic, spicy, and delicious.
When you go to a Middle Eastern restaurant, allow at least a couple of hours
for the dining experience — don’t be surprised if you end up savoring a five-
or even seven-course meal!
Perusing the menu
As in other restaurants, the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam in Middle Eastern restau-
rants is usually divided into three sections:
 muqabbilaat (moo-kah-bee-lat; appetizers)
 Ta’aam ra’iisii (tah-am rah-ee-see; main course/entrees)
 taHliya (tah-lee-yah; dessert)
Appetizers
In the muqabbilaat section of the menu, you find some Ta’aam khafiif (tah-
am kah-feef; light food) to help build your appetite. Here are some common
muqabbilaat:
 rubyaan (roob-yan; shrimp)
 baadhinjaan (bah-zeen-jan; eggplant)
93
Chapter 5: This Is Delicious! Eating In and Dining Out

 kam’a (kam-ah; truffles)
 thuum muHammar (toom moo-hah-mar; roasted garlic)
 waraq ‘ay-nab (wah-rak ay-nab; stuffed vine leaves)
 ‘adas (ah-das; lentils)
 Hasaa’ (hah-sah; soup)
 Hariira (hah-ree-rah; Middle Eastern soup)
Entrees
The Ta’aam ra’iisii consist of dishes featuring dajaaj (chicken), various other
laHam (meat), and samak (fish). samak is usually a very popular dish because
it’s tasty, healthy, and light. Most restaurants have a pretty extensive selection
of samak, including:
 salmoon (sal-moon; salmon)
 al-qood (al-kood; cod)
 tuun (toon; tuna)
 al-’uTruuT (al-oot-root; trout)
 ‘isqoomrii (ees-koom-ree; mackerel)
 shabbooT (shah-boot; carp)
 moosaa (moo-sah; sole)
 qirsh (kee-resh; shark)
Desserts
Like a lot of people, my favorite part of a restaurant menu is, of course, the
taHliya! The taHliya is a great way to wrap up a nice wajba. I like the taHliya
because there are a lot of Halawiyyaat (hah-lah-wee-yat; sweets) to choose
from. Here are some popular taHliya:
 ka’k (kahk; cake)
 ka’k ash-shuukuulaat (kahk ah-shoo-koo-lat; chocolate cake)
 Halwa al-jaliidiiya (hal-wah jah-lee-dee-yah; ice cream)
 ‘aTbaaq (at-bak; pudding)
 al-jubun (al-joo-boon; cheese)
Beverages
In addition to Ta’aam, you may also notice a portion of the menu — or an
entirely different menu — introducing different kinds of mashruubaat (mash-
roo-bat; drinks). The following are some mashruubaat you may come across
in the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam:
94
Part II: Arabic in Action

 maa’ (mah; water)
 maa’ ghaaziya (mah gah-zee-yah; soda water)
 ‘aSiir al-laymoon (ah-seer ah-lay-moon; lemonade)
 al-khamer (al-kah-mer; alcohol)
 biirra (bee-rah; beer)
 nabiidh (nah-beez; wine)
 nabiidh ‘aHmar (nah-beez ah-mar; red wine)
 nabiidh ‘abyaD (nah-beez ab-yad; white wine)
Placing your order
After you peruse the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam, you’re ready to place your order
with the khaadim al-maT’am (waiter) or khaadimat al-maT’am (waitress).
maT’am staff are usually highly trained individuals who know the ins and
outs of the Ta’aam that the maT’am serves, so don’t be afraid of asking lots
of ‘as’ila (ass-ee-lah; questions) about things on the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam that
sound good to you.

Finishing your meal and paying the bill
When you finish your meal, you’re ready to leave the maT’am. But before you
do, you need to take care of your Hisaab (hee-sab; bill). You may ask your
waiter for the bill by saying al-Hisaab min faDlik (al-hee-sab meen fad-leek; the
bill please). Another option is to ask the waiter or waitress kam al-kaamil?
(kam al-kah-meel; What’s the total?).
Like in the United States, tipping your waiter or waitress is customary in
Arabic-speaking countries and Middle Eastern restaurants. The amount of the
baqsheeh (bak-sheesh; tip) depends on the kind of service you received, but
usually 15 to 20 percent is average.

Going Shopping
In This Chapter
 Browsing inside the store
 Comparing items and costs
 Identifying clothing sizes and colors
W
hether you’re in a foreign country or at the local mall, shopping can
be a lot of fun. Not only do you get to buy things to maintain your
lifestyle, but you also can discover new items and buy things you hadn’t even
considered.
This chapter exposes you to the important words and terms that help you
shop, whether you’re in an Arabic-speaking country or simply interacting
with an Arabic-speaking store owner. Discover how to choose the right dress
size, how to choose the best item from an electronics store, and even how to
shop for nice jewelry! You also find out how to interact with sales staff so that
you’re sure to find and purchase the item that you want.
Going to the Store
When you want to buy something, you head to the dukkaan (doo-kan; store).
Depending on your shopping list, you can choose from different types of
dakaakiin (dah-kah-keen; stores). If you want to buy some khubz (koo-bez;
bread), then you want to head to the makhbaza (mak-bah-zah; bakery). If
you’re trying to find a particular kitaab (kee-tab; book), then your destination
is the maktaba (mak-tah-bah; bookstore/library). To buy malaabis (mah-lah-
bees; clothes), head to dukkaan al-malaabis (doo-kan al-mah-lah-bees; cloth-
ing store). And if you want to buy a midyaa’ (meed-yah; radio) or tilifizyoon
(tee-lee-feez-yoon; television), the dukkaan al-iliktroniyaat (doo-kan al-ee-
leek-troo-nee-yat; electronics store) is your best bet.

Here are some additional specialty dakaakiin you may need to visit:
 dukkaan al-Halawiyyaat (doo-kan al-hah-lah-wee-yat; pastry shop)
 dukkaan al-baqqaal (doo-kan al-bah-kal; grocery store)
 dukkaan as-samak (doo-kan ah-sah-mak; fish store)
 jawharii (jaw-hah-ree; jeweler)
Not all dakaakiin sell only goods or products. Other types of dakaakiin pro-
vide services, such as haircuts and manicures. Here are some dakaakiin that
are more service-oriented:
 maktab as-siyaaHa (mak-tab ah-see-yah-hah; travel agency)
 Hallaaq (hah-lak; barber/hairdresser)
 dukkaan al-jamal (doo-kan al-jah-mal; beauty parlor)
If you need to shop for a variety of goods, then your destination is the
dukkaan kabiir (doo-kan kah-beer; department store/mall). At the dukkaan
kabiir, you can find almost everything and anything you want. Or if you’re
not sure what to buy, going to the dukkaan kabiir is a great idea because you
have so many choices that you’re bound to find something that you need or
want to purchase!
Browsing the merchandise
If you’re at the dukkaan and aren’t quite sure what to purchase, then browsing
and checking out the different items is a good idea. You don’t have to buy any-
thing, and that’s what can be so much fun about window shopping. Feel free to
look through the dukkaan naafida (doo-kan nah-fee-dah; window) for any items
that may attract your attention. While you’re browsing, a khaadim ad-dukkaan
(kah-deem ah-doo-kan; store clerk) (M) or a khaadima ad-dukkaan (kah-dee-
mah ah-doo-kan; store clerk) (F) may ask:
 hal yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’iduka? (hal yoom-keen an oo-sah-ee-doo-kah?; May
I help you?) (M)
hal yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’iduki? (hal yoom-keen an oo-sah-ee-doo-kee?; May I
help you?) (F)
 hal turiidu shay’ khaaS? (hal too-ree-doo shay kas?; Are you looking for
anything in particular?) (M)
hal turiidiina shay’ khaaS? (hal too-ree-dee-nah shay kas?; Are you look-
ing for anything in particular?) (F)

If you need musaa’ada (moo-sah-ah-dah; help/assistance), simply respond by
saying na’am (nah-am; yes). (For more on how to ask for and get musaa’ada,
skip to the section “Asking for a Particular Item,” later in this chapter.)
Otherwise, if you want to continue browsing, laa shukran (lah shook-ran; no
thank you) should do the trick.
Getting around the store
If you visit a dukkaan kabiir, you probably need some sort of musaa’ada
because department stores can be very big and very confusing. If you want
tawjiihaat (taw-jee-hat; directions), head to the maktab al-’i’laamaat (mak-tab
al-eeh-lah-mat; information desk) to have your ‘as’ila (ass-ee-lah; questions)
answered. Here are some common ‘as’ila you may ask:
 hal yumkin ‘an tusaa’idunii? (hal yoom-keen an too-sah-ee-doo-nee; Is it
possible for you to help me?)
 ‘ayna aT-Tabiq al-’awwal? (ay-nah ah-tah-beek al-ah-wal; Where is the

 ‘ayna al-miS’ad? (ay-nah al-mees-ad; Where is the elevator?)
 ‘ayna maHall al-malaabis? (ay-nah mah-hal al-mah-lah-bees; Where is the

Getting to know the verb “to search”
Shopping usually involves searching for particular items. In order to help
with your baHth (bah-heth; search), you should be familiar with the verbs
baHatha (bah-hah-thah; searched) and yabHathu (yab-hah-thoo; searching).
Luckily, baHatha is a regular verb, meaning that it has three consonants and
is conjugated in the maaDii (mah-dee; past) tense and muDaari’ (moo-dah-
reeh; present) tense using the same patterns of prefixes and suffixes as most
other regular verbs.
Here’s the verb baHatha in the maaDii form:

Asking for a Particular Item
Oftentimes, you head to the dukkaan not to window shop or browse around
the store but because you have a specific item in mind that you want to pur-
chase. When you want to direct a khaadim ad-dukkaan to a particular item,
you’re likely to need a demonstrative word, such as “that one” or “this” or
“those over there.” Demonstratives are the little words we use to specify par-
ticular items. Arabic has a number of different demonstratives, depending on
the number of items (singular or plural) and gender (in case of human nouns),
as well as state (present or absent). Table 6-1 presents the common demon-
stratives in Arabic:

Chapter 6: Going Shopping

Notice that the singular demonstratives (haadhaa, haadhihi, dhaalika, and
tilka) are all gender-defined, meaning that you use a specific demonstrative
corresponding to whether the object being referred to is masculine or femi-
nine. On the other hand, the plural demonstratives, haa’ulaa’ii and ‘ulaa’ika,
are gender-neutral, meaning that the gender of the object being pointed to
doesn’t matter.
In a sentence, you always place the demonstrative word before the object
being pointed to, which is often a noun. In addition, the noun must be defined
using the definite prefix pronoun al-. Here are some examples to illustrate the
use of the definite prefix pronoun:
 haadhaa al-walad (hah-zah al-wah-lad; this boy)
 haadhihi al-bint (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net; this girl)
 dhaalika ar-rajul (zah-lee-kah ah-rah-jool; that man)
 tilka al-mar’a (teel-kah al-mar-ah; that woman)
 haa’ulaa’ii al-banaat (hah-oo-lah-ee al-bah-nat; these girls)
 ‘ulaa’ika an-nisaa’ (oo-lah-ee-kah ah-nee-sah; those women)
It’s important to not only follow the specific order of the demonstrative
phrase (demonstrative word followed by the noun) but also to make sure the
noun is defined. If the noun isn’t defined with the definite article prefix al-,
the meaning of the demonstrative phrase changes dramatically. Arabic has
no verb “to be” in the present tense, but because every language requires
“is/are” sentences to function appropriately, “is/are” sentences are created in
Arabic by manipulating these little definite articles. If you include a demon-
strative followed by an undefined noun, you create a demonstrative “is/are”
sentence. Using the examples from the earlier list, look at what happens to
the demonstrative phrase when the definite article isn’t included:
 haadhaa walad (hah-zah wah-lad; this is a boy)
 haadhihi bint (hah-zee-hee bee-net; this is a girl)
 dhaalika rajul (zah-lee-kah rah-jool; that is a man)
 tilka mar’a (teel-kah mar-ah; that is a woman)
 haa’ulaa’ii banaat (hah-oo-lah-ee bah-nat; these are girls)
 ‘ulaa’ika nisaa’ (oo-lah-ee-kah nee-sah; those are women)
As you can see by comparing these two lists, one small prefix can radically
alter the meaning of a sentence.

Comparing Merchandise
Have you ever been shopping and found yourself debating between two or
more comparable items? Perhaps you have a general idea of what you want
to buy — a television, for instance — but you aren’t sure what year, make, or
model you want. In these instances, being able to compare merchandise is
important. In this section, you discover how to evaluate comparable (and
incomparable) items based on a variety of important criteria, such as price,
quality, and durability.
In order to be able to compare different items, it’s necessary to have an
understanding of degrees of adjectives and superlatives. In English, degrees
of adjectives have straightforward applicability. For example, in order to say
that something is bigger than another thing, you simply add the suffix -er to
the adjective; hence “big” becomes “bigger.” Furthermore, when you’re com-
paring two or more items, you use comparatives, meaning you use both the
degree of adjectives followed by the preposition “than.” For instance, “the
truck is bigger than the car.” To say that something is the biggest, you only
need to add the suffix -est to the adjective; so “big” becomes “biggest,” as in
“it’s the biggest car.” This form is called a superlative.
Fortunately, the structures of degrees of adjectives, comparatives, and
superlatives in Arabic are fairly similar to those in English.
Comparing two or more items
Adjectives are the linguistic backbone that allow for comparisons between
different items, products, or goods. Table 6-2 lists some of the most common
adjectives followed by their comparative forms.

Place these adjectives in their appropriate context in the phrase or sentence —
using these adjectives independently changes their meanings. Similar to the
English language structure, the comparative form of adjectives always follows
this pattern:
noun + adjective comparative form + preposition min (meen; than) +
second adjective
It’s essential that you include the preposition min right after every compara-
tive adjective. In addition, all nouns being compared need to be defined by
attaching to them the definite article prefix al-.
Here are some common examples of comparative sentences using the adjec-
tive forms:
 al-bint ‘akbar min al-walad. (al-bee-net ak-bar meen al-wah-lad; The girl
is bigger than the boy.)
 at-tilifizyuun ‘aghlaa min al-midyaa’. (ah-tee-lee-fee-zee-yoon ag-lah
meen al-meed-yah; The television is more expensive than the radio.)
 as-sayyaara ‘asra’ min as-shaaHina. (ah-sah-yah-rah as-rah meen ah-shah-
hee-nah; The car is faster than the bus.)
 aj-jakiiTa ‘arkhas min al-qamiis. (ah-jah-kee-tah ar-kas meen al-kah-mees;
The jacket is cheaper than the shirt.)
110
Part II: Arabic in Action

When forming these types of sentences, you may add demonstratives to be
even more specific. Here are examples of comparative sentences used in con-
junction with demonstratives:
 haadhihi al-bint ‘akbar min dhaalika al-walad. (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net
ak-bar meen zah-lee-kah al-wah-lad; This girl is bigger than that boy.)
 haa’ulaa’ii as-sayyaaraat ‘asra’ min ‘ulaa’ika as-shaahinaat. (hah-oo-lah-
ee ah-sah-yah-rat as-rah meen oo-lah-ee-kah ah-shah-hee-nat; These cars
are faster than those buses.)
 tilka al-‘imra’a ‘ajmal min dhaalika ar-rajul. (teel-kah al-eem-rah-ah aj-
mal meen zah-lee-kah ah-rah-jool; That woman is prettier than that man.)
 haadhaa al-walad ‘akbar min ‘ulaa’ika al-banaat. (hah-zah al-wah-lad
ak-bar meen oo-lah-ee-kah al-bah-nat; This boy is bigger than those girls.)
Notice in the examples that the adjective comparative form remains constant
whether the nouns being compared are a combination of singular/singular,
singular/plural, or plural/plural. In other words, the adjective comparatives
are gender-neutral: They remain the same regardless of both gender and
number.
Picking out the best item
A superlative describes something that is of the highest order, degree, or
quality. Some common superlatives in English are “best,” “brightest,”
“fastest,” “cleanest,” “cheapest,” and so on. Superlatives in Arabic are actu-
ally very straightforward and shouldn’t be hard for you to understand if you
have a good grasp of comparatives (see the preceding section).
Basically, a superlative in Arabic is nothing more than the comparative form
of the adjective! The only difference is that comparatives include the preposi-
tion min (than) and superlatives don’t include any preposition. For example,
to tell someone, “This is the biggest house,” you say haadhaa ‘akbar manzil
(hah-zah ak-bar man-zeel).
The biggest differences between superlatives and comparatives are:
 The superlative adjective always comes before the noun.
 When expressing a superlative, the noun is always undefined.
Here are some common examples of superlative sentences:
 haadhihi ‘ajmal bint. (hah-zee-hee aj-mal bee-net; This is the prettiest
girl.)
 dhaalika ‘ab’ad dukkaan. (zah-lee-kah ab-ad doo-kan; That is the far-
thest store.)
111
Chapter 6: Going Shopping

If you switch the order of the words to demonstrative + noun + superlative,
be sure to define the noun. That’s the only other way you can construct a
superlative sentence. For example:
 haadhihi al-bint ‘ajmal. (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net aj-mal; This girl is the
prettiest.)
 dhaalika ad-dukaan ‘ab’ad. (zah-lee-kah ah-doo-kan ab-ad; That store is
the farthest.)

More Than a Few Words About 
Buying and Selling
Perhaps the two most important verbs relating to shopping are yashtarii
(yash-tah-ree; to buy) and yabii’u (yah-bee-ooh; to sell). Unlike other verbs in
Arabic, these two critical verbs are irregular, which means they don’t follow a
particular pattern. Because these verbs are widely used and have their own
pattern, you should be familiar with how to conjugate them.
Use the form baa’a (bah-ah; sold) to conjugate yabii’u in the maaDii (past):

Shopping for Clothes
For many people, one of the most essential items to shop for is malaabis
(mah-lah-bees; clothes). Whether you’re in a foreign country or shopping at
the local mall, chances are that malaabis make it on your shopping list. Table
6-3 lists some basic articles of clothing and accessories you should know.

An important consideration when you’re out shopping for malaabis is al-
Hajem (al-hah-jem; size). The four standard clothes sizes are:
 Saghiir (sah-geer; small) (American size [Men’s]: 34–36; American size
[Women’s]: 6–8)
 waSat (wah-sat; medium) (American size [Men’s]: 38–40; American size
[Women’s]: 10–12)
 kabiir (kah-beer; large) (American size [Men’s]: 42–44; American size
[Women’s]: 14–16)
 zaa’id kabiir (zah-eed kah-beer; extra large) (American size [Men’s]: 46
and above; American size [Women’s]: 18–20)
Another important consideration in clothes shopping is the lawn (lah-wen;
color). Because ‘alwaan (al-wan; colors) are adjectives that describe nouns, a
lawn always must agree with the noun in terms of gender. If you’re describing
a feminine noun, use the feminine form of the lawn. When describing mascu-
line nouns, use the masculine forms. How do you know whether a noun is
feminine or masculine? In about 80 percent of the cases, feminine nouns end
with a fatHa, or the “ah” sound. For the rest, simply look up the word in the
qaamuus (kah-moos; dictionary) to determine its gender. The masculine and
feminine forms of some common colors appear in Table 6-4.

P
art of the fun of mastering a new language is putting your growing lan-
guage skills to good use; one of the best ways to do that is by exploring
a madiina (mah-dee-nah; city). Whether you’re visiting a city in your home
country or traveling in a Middle Eastern city, this chapter introduces you to
key words, phrases, and concepts to help you navigate any madiina — from
entertainment spots to cultural venues — like a native Arabic speaker!
Telling Time in Arabic
When you’re exploring a madiina, you’re guaranteed to have a difficult time
catching buses to get around or buying tickets for specific events if you can’t
tell or ask the time. And telling waqt (wah-ket; time) in Arabic is an entirely
different proposition than telling time in English. In fact, you have to accept a
fundamental difference right off the bat: Arabic doesn’t use an a.m./p.m. con-
vention to denote the time of day, nor does it use the 24-hour military clock
(according to which, for example, 10:00 p.m. is written as 22:00). So how do
you know which part of the day it is if you can’t use the 24-hour system or the
a.m./p.m. convention? It’s actually very simple: You specify the time of day!
So you say, for example, “It’s 10:00 in the morning,” or “It’s 10:00 at night.”
Easy enough, don’t you think? (For more on this issue, see the section
“Specifying the time of day” later in this chapter.)
If you want to ask someone for the time, you ask the following question: kam
as-saa’a? (kam ah-sah-ah; What time is it?). If someone asks you this question,
the appropriate response is as-saa’a followed by the ordinal of the hour. So you

would say, for instance, “It’s the second hour” as opposed to saying “It’s 2:00.”
Because as-saa’a is a feminine noun, you use the feminine form of the ordinal
numbers, which are listed in Table 7-1. (See Chapter 4 for more on numbers.)

You need to use the definite prefix article al- with the ordinals because you’re
referring to a specific hour and not just any hour.
The following are some additional key words related to telling time in Arabic:
 saa’a (sah-ah; hour)
 daqiiqa (da-kee-kah; minute)
 thaaniya (thah-nee-yah; second)
 ba’da (bah-dah; after)
 qabla (kab-lah; before)

 qabla al-baariHa (kab-lah al-bah-ree-hah; the day before yesterday)
122
Part II: Arabic in Action

Specifying the time of day
Because Arabic uses neither the a.m./p.m. system nor the 24-hour military
clock, when giving the time, you need to specify the time of day by actually
saying what part of the day it is.
Here are the different times of day you’re likely to use:
 aS-SabaaH (ah-sah-bah; morning, or sunrise to 11:59 a.m.)
 aDH-DHuhr (ah-zoo-her; noon, or 12:00 p.m.)
 ba’da aDH-DHuhr (bah-dah ah-zoo-her; afternoon, or 12:01 p.m. 
to 4:00 p.m.)
 al-‘asr (al-ah-ser; late afternoon, or 4:01 p.m. to sunset)
 al-masaa’ (al-mah-sah; evening, or sunset to two hours after sunset)
 al-layl (ah-lah-yel; night, or sunset to two hours to sunrise)
For example, if the time is 2:00 p.m., then you attach ba’da aDH-DHuhr to the
proper ordinal. If sunset is at 6:00 p.m. and you want to say the time’s 7:00 p.m.,
then you use al-masaa’ and the ordinal because al-masaa’ applies to the two-
hour period right after sunset; if sunset is at 6:00 p.m. and you want to say the
time’s 9:00 p.m., then you use al-layl and the ordinal because 9:00 p.m. falls 
outside the scope of the evening convention (see the preceding list).
The convention used to specify the part of the day is fairly straightforward:
as-saa’a + ordinal number + fii (fee; in) + part of the day
So when someone asks you kam as-saa’a, your literal reply in Arabic is “It’s
the ninth hour in the morning,” for instance. The following are some exam-
ples to better illustrate responses to the question kam as-saa’?:
 as-saa’a al-waaHida fii ba’da aDH-DHuhr. (ah-sah-ah al-wah-hee-dah fee
bah-dah ah-zoo-her; It’s 1:00 in the afternoon.)
 as-saa’a al-khaamisa fii al-‘asr. (ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-sah fee al-ah-ser; It’s
5:00 in the late afternoon.)
 as-saa’a al-Haadiya ‘ashra fii aS-SabaaH. (ah-sah-ah al-hah-dee-yah 
ah-shrah fee ah-sah-bah; It’s 11:00 in the morning.)
 as-saa’a at-taasi’a fii al-layl. (ah-sah-ah ah-tah-see-ah fee ah-lah-yel; It’s
9:00 in [at] night.)
 as-saa’a as-saabi’a fii al-masaa’. (ah-sah-ah ah-sah-bee-ah fee al-mah-sah;
It’s 7:00 in the evening.)
123
Chapter 7: Around Town

Specifying minutes
When telling time in Arabic, you can specify minutes in two different ways:
noting the fractions of the hour, such as a half, a quarter, and a third, or actu-
ally spelling out the minutes. Because these methods have different conven-
tions, this section examines each method separately.
Using fractions of the hour
When using the fraction method of telling minutes, use the following structure:
as-saa’a + ordinal number + wa (wah; and) + fraction
So what you’re in fact saying is “It’s the second hour and a half,” for example.
In English transliteration, that’s the equivalent of “It’s half past two.”
The main fractions you use are:
 an-niSf (ah-nee-sef; half)
 ath-thuluth (ah-thoo-looth; third)
 ar-rubu’ (ah-roo-booh; quarter)
 ‘ashara (ah-sha-rah; tenth)
The following examples show you how to use the fraction method to specify
minutes when telling time:
 as-saa’a ath-thaaniya wa ar-rubu’. (ah-sah-ah ah-thah-nee-yah wah 
ah-roo-booh; It’s quarter past two.)
 as-saa’a at-taasi’a wa an-niSf. (ah-sah-ah ah-tah-see-ah wah ah-nee-sef; It’s
half past nine.)
 as-saa’a al-waaHida wa ath-thuluth. (ah-sah-ah al-wah-hee-dah wah 
ah-thoo-looth; It’s twenty past one.)
 as-saa’a al-khaamisa wa ar-rubu’. (ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-sah wah 
ah-roo-booh; It’s quarter past five.)
 as-saa’a al-Haadiya ‘ashra wa an-niSf. (ah-sah-ah al-hah-dee-yah ah-shrah
wah ah-nee-sef; It’s half past eleven.)
Using this system, you can cover ten past the hour, quarter past the hour,
twenty past the hour, and half past the hour, which are the major fractions.
But what if you want to say “It’s quarter of” or “It’s twenty of”? In those cases,
you need to use the preposition ‘ilaa (ee-lah), which means “of” or “to.” If you
think of the preposition wa as adding to the hour then think of ‘ilaa as sub-
tracting from the hour.
124
Part II: Arabic in Action

Because ‘ilaa subtracts from the hour, you must add one hour to whatever
hour you’re referring to. For example, if you want to say “It’s 5:45,” then you
must say “It’s quarter of six” and not “It’s a quarter of five,” which would be
4:45. Here are some examples that use ‘ilaa:
 as-saa’a as-saadisa ‘ilaa ar-rubu’. (ah-sah-ah ah-sah-dee-sah ee-lah ah-roo-
booh; It’s quarter to six, or 5:45.)
 as-saa’a al-waaHida ‘ilaa ath-thuluth. (ah-sah-ah al-wah-hee-dah ee-lah
ah-thoo-looth; It’s twenty to one, or 12:40.)
If you want to express minutes as a fraction and specify which time of day
(a.m. or p.m.), you simply add fii and the time of day. For example, as-saa’a 
al-waaHida wa an-niSf fii ba’da aDH-DHuhr means “It’s 1:30 in the after-
noon.” Here are other examples:
 as-saa’a ath-thaaniya ‘ashra wa ar-rubu’ fii al-layl. (ah-sah-ah ah-thah-
nee-yah ah-shrah wah ah-roo-booh fee ah-lah-yel; It’s 12:15 at night, or
12:15 a.m.)
 as-saa’a as-saabi’a wa an-niSf fii al masaa’. (ah-sah-ah ah-sah-bee-ah wah
ah-nee-sef fee al-mah-sah; It’s 7:30 in the evening.)
 as-saa’a ath-thaamina wa ar-rubu’ fii aS-SabaaH. (ah-sah-ah ah-tha-nee-
yah wah ah-roo-booh fee ah-sah-bah; It’s 8:15 in the morning.)
 as-saa’a al-khaamisa ‘ilaa ar-rubu’ fii al-’asr. (ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-sah
ee-lah ah-roo-booh fee al-ah-ser; It’s quarter to five in the late afternoon,
or  4:45 p.m.)

Spelling out minutes
When expressing time, you can specify the minutes by actually spelling them
out. (Check out Chapter 4 for full coverage of cardinal numbers.) Use the fol-
lowing format:
as-saa’a + ordinal/hours + wa + cardinal/minutes + daqiiqa
So as-saa’a al-khaamisa wa ‘khamsat daqiiqa (ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-sah wah
kam-sat dah-kee-kah) means “It’s 5:05.” Here are some other examples:
126

 as-saa’a ath-thaamina wa khamsa wa ‘arba’iin daqiiqa fii aS-SabaaH.
(ah-sah-ah ah-thah-mee-nah wah kam-sah wah ar-bah-een dah-kee-kah; It’s

Visiting Museums
I love museums because I can learn so much about virtually any topic, from
irrigation systems during the Roman Empire to the brush techniques of the
Impressionist artists. The matHaf (mat-haf; museum) plays a central role in the
Arab madiina (mah-dee-nah; city); Arab people have a deep sense of history
and their role in it, and one way to preserve some of that history, in the form of
great Arab and Islamic works of art and achievements, is in the matHaf.
Here are some Middle Eastern museums worth visiting, in both the United
States and the Middle East:
 The Dahesh Museum in New York, New York
 The Arab-American Museum in Detroit, Michigan
 al-ahram Museum in Cairo, Egypt
 Baghdad Museum in Baghdad, Iraq

A ziyaara (zee-yah-rah; visit) to a matHaf can be a wonderful experience as
long as you follow a number of qawaa’id (kah-wah-eed; rules). These qawaa’id
ensure that your experience and the experiences of others at the matHaf are
jamiila (jah-mee-lah; pleasant).
The word mamnuu’ (mam-nooh) means “prohibited,” and the word Daruurii
(dah-roo-ree) means “required”; whenever you see the word mamnuu’ on a
sign, it’s usually accompanied by a picture of the item that’s prohibited with a
red line across it. Make sure to pay attention to the qawaa’id so that you
don’t get into trouble with the matHaf management!
When visiting a matHaf, you may see signs that say the following:
 Suwar mamnuu’a. (soo-war mam-noo-ah; Taking pictures is 
prohibited.)
 dukhuul mamnuu’. (doo-kool mam-nooh; Entering is prohibited.)
 sijaara mamnuu’a. (see-jah-rah mam-noo-ah; Smoking is prohibited.)
 Ta’aam mamnuu’. (tah-am mam-nooh; Food is prohibited.)
 maa’ mamnuu’. (mah mam-nooh; Water is prohibited.)
 Hidhaa’ Daruurii. (hee-dah dah-roo-ree; Shoes required.)
 malaabis Daruuriya. (mah-lah-bees dah-roo-ree-yah; Proper attire
required.)

Arabic scholars and Western civilization
Many of the works of the ancient Greek masters,
such as Aristotle and Plato, were preserved by
Islamic scholars when Europe was plunged into
the Dark Ages (from about the Fifth through the
Tenth centuries). Islamic scholars throughout the
Muslim world, in Cordoba, Spain, and elsewhere
translated gargantuan amounts of texts from
Greek and Latin into Arabic. They studied these
texts extensively and added a significant amount
to the pool of knowledge. Thanks to the work of
these Islamic scholars, much of the knowledge
that serves as the basis of Western thought and
civilization was preserved. In fact, while Europe
was in the Dark Ages, Islam went through a
revival and renaissance period not experienced
anywhere else in the world.

Although most verbs in Arabic have three consonants — such as kataba
(kah-tah-bah; to write), jalasa (jah-lah-sah; to sit), or darasa (dah-rah-sah; to
study) — zaara (zah-rah), the verb form for “to visit,” contains only two con-
sonants. This difference makes zaara an irregular verb.
If you want to visit a lot of different places around the madiina, being able to
conjugate the irregular verb zaara in both the maaDii (past) and the muDaari’
(present) tenses is particularly helpful. Because zaara is irregular, there’s no
specific form — like the one available for regular verbs in Chapter 2 — where
a pattern is apparent.
For the maaDii form of visited, use zaara (zah-rah):

Going to the Movies
Going to see a shariiT siinimaa’ii (sha-reet see-nee-mah-ee; movie) in a
maSraH siiniima’ii (mas-rah see-nee-mah-ee; movie theater) is a very popular
pastime for people in the Middle East. American action movies are a particu-
larly favorite genre — don’t be surprised if you walk into a movie theater in a
Middle Eastern city and see Clint Eastwood on the big screen! Most of the
movies shown in these maSraH siiniima’ii are actually the original versions
with tarjamat al-Hiiwaar (tar-jah-mat al-hee-war; subtitles) at the bottom of
the screen. Here are some other popular movie genres:
 mughaamara (moo-gah-mah-rah; action/adventure)
 maSraHiyya (mas-rah-hee-yah; comedy)
 draamii (drah-mee; drama)
 ru’aat al-baqar (roo-aht al-bah-kar; western)
 wathaa’iqii (wah-tha-ee-kee; documentary)
 rusuum al-mutaHarrika (roo-soom al-moo-tah-hah-ree-kah; cartoon)
The verb most commonly associated with going to the movies is dhahaba
(za-hah-bah; to go). Using the conjugations that follow, you can say dhahabtu
‘ilaa al-maSraH as-siiniima’ii (za-hab-too ee-lah al-mas-rah ah-see-nee-mah-ee;
I went to the movie theater), or yadhhabu ‘ilaa al-maSraH as-siiniima’ii (yaz-
hah-boo ee-lah al-mas-rah ah-see-nee-mah-ee; He is going to the movies) and
much, much more.

Touring Religious Sites
If you ever get a chance to go to the Middle East, I suggest you visit some of
the beautiful religious sites that are spread across the land. If you’re in a
Middle Eastern or Arab city, be sure to check out a masjid (mas-jeed;
mosque). The largest masaajid (mah-sah-jeed; mosques) in the Muslim world
are located in Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia, and in Casablanca, Morocco.
A few rules to keep in mind
When visiting masaajid, you must follow certain qawaa’id (rules):
 If you’re Muslim, you’re allowed to walk into any masjid you like; but
before entering, you must remove your shoes and say the shahada
(shah-hah-dah; religious prayer): laa ‘ilaaha ‘illaa allah wa muHammad
rasuul allah (lah ee-lah-hah ee-lah ah-lah wah moo-hah-mad rah-sool 
ah-lah; There is no god but God and Muhammad is his Prophet.).
138
Part II: Arabic in Action

 If you’re non-Muslim, entry into a masjid is generally forbidden,
whether you’re in the Middle East, the United States, or anywhere
around the world. However, certain mosques, such as the masjid Hassan
II in Casablanca, have designated wings that are open to both Muslims
and non-Muslims. These wings are set aside more as exhibition rooms
than as religious or prayer rooms, so you’re allowed to enter them, but
you still must remove your Hidaa’ (hee-dah; shoes).
The word masjid comes from the verb sajada (sah-jah-dah), which means “to
prostrate” or “to kneel.” Another word for “mosque” is jaami’ (jah-meeh),
which comes from the word jama’a (jah-mah-ah; to gather). So the Arabic
words for “mosque” are related to what one actually does in the mosque,
which is to gather in a religious setting and pray.
The Hajj
One of the most popular events during the year for Muslims is the Hajj (haj),
which is the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The Hajj, which generally
lasts for five days, takes place once a year and is actually one of the five pil-
lars of Islam. Technically, attending the Hajj is mandatory for Muslims, but
because the pilgrimage can be expensive, it’s widely accepted that one can
be a Muslim without actually having to attend the Hajj.
During the Hajj, Hajjaaj (hah-jaj; pilgrims) must follow a number of qawaa’id.
As soon as the Hajjaaj arrive in Mecca, they must shed all their worldly cloth-
ing and possessions and change into sandals and a simple ihram (eeh-ram),
which basically consists of a white cloth wrapped around the body. Other
than these two items, the Hajjaaj aren’t allowed to wear any watches, jewelry,
or any other types of clothes. The logic behind wearing only the ihram is that
every Hajjaaj is equal before God, and because no difference exists between a
king and a beggar during the Hajj, everyone must wear the same thing.
After they don the ihram, the Hajjaaj begin a ritual known as the Tawaf (tah-
waf; to turn), in which they walk around the ka’ba (kah-bah), a cubelike
structure located in the middle of the masjid al-Haraam (mas-jeed al-hah-ram;
The Sacred Mosque of Mecca). According to the Koran and other religious
texts, the ka’ba was built by the Prophet Abraham for the purpose of wor-
ship. The Hajjaaj must circle the ka’ba seven times in an anti-clockwise
manner. After the Tawaf, the Hajjaaj walk to the hills of Safa and Marwah
before walking to Medina, the city where the Prophet Muhammad is buried.
From Medina, the Hajjaaj walk to the hill of Arafat, then to the city of Mina,
before returning to the ka’ba for a final Tawaf.
139
Chapter 7: Around Town

Because the Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, literally millions upon
millions of people make the voyage to Saudi Arabia to participate in this pil-
grimage every year, making it by far the largest religious pilgrimage in the
world. In fact, it’s not uncommon to have at least 5 million Hajjaaj in the
cities of Mecca and Medina during the Hajj. Once a Muslim has performed
the Hajj, he or she receives a special status in society, complete with a title:
A man who has completed the Hajj is called al-Hajj (al-haj), and a woman
who has done the Hajj is called al-Hajja (al-hah-jah).
Saudi Arabian law prohibits non-Muslims from entering Mecca during the
‘amra (am-rah; the time of year when the Hajj takes place). If you’re non-
Muslim, you may be able to visit Saudi Arabia and some of its other mosques
and religious sites during this period, but you won’t be permitted to visit the
ka’ba and some of the other religious sites related to the Hajj.

anguage teachers may not want you to hear this, but if you want to prac-
tice a new language, move outside the classroom. Doing things you like,
such as playing sports, creating music, or playing card games, is one of the
best ways to immerse yourself in your chosen language. In this section, I
introduce new words and phrases to help you have fun in Arabic!
Starting Out with the Verbs fa’ala (Did)
and yaf’alu (To Do)
One of the most frequently used verbs in the Arabic language is fa’ala (fah-ah-
lah; did). In the maaDii (mah-dee; past tense), use the fa’ala form; for the
muDaari’ (moo-dah-reeh; present tense), use yaf’alu (yah-feh-ah-loo; to
do/doing). Use the verb fa’ala to describe activities or riyaaDa (ree-yah-dah;
sports) you’re taking part in.
Here’s the verb fa’ala conjugated in the maaDii form:

Here are a few examples of the verb fa’ala in action:
 al-walad dhahaba ‘ilaa al-maktaba wa fa’ala waajibuhu. (al-wah-lad
zah-hah-bah ee-lah al-mak-tah-bah wah fah-ah-lah wah-jee-boo-hoo; The
boy went to the library and did his homework.)
 fa’alat al-‘amal ‘alaa aT-Taawila. (fah-ah-lat al-ah-mal ah-lah ah-tah-wee-
lah; She did the work on the table.)
 fa’altu at-tamriinaat fii al-manzil. (fah-all-too ah-tam-ree-nat fee al-man-
zeel; I did the exercises at home.)
Then use the form yaf’alu to conjugate “to do” in the muDaari’:

paperwork right now.)
 taf’alu at-tajriibaat fii al-Hadiiqa. (tah-fah-loo ah-taj-ree-bat fee al-hah-

 hal taf’aluuna al-‘amal li al-ghad? (hal tah-fah-loo-nah al-ah-mal lee 
al-gad; Are you doing the work for tomorrow?)
Sporting an Athletic Side
I don’t know about you, but I love playing riyaaDa, whether it’s an individual
sport such as al-ghuulf (al-goo-lef; golf) or a team sport like kurat al-qadam
(koo-rat al-kah-dam; soccer).
kurat al-qadam is one of the most popular sports among Arabic-speaking
people; in the Middle East, it comes as close as any sport to being the
“national” sport. One reason why kurat al-qadam is so popular is because it’s
a riyaaDa mushaahada (ree-yah-dah moo-sha-hah-dah; spectator sport). In a
typical mubaara (moo-bah-rah; game), one fariiq (fah-reek; team) with 11
players plays another fariiq in a mal’ab (mah-lab; stadium). Fans follow the
natiija (nah-tee-jah; score) closely, hoping that their fariiq manages a fawz
(fah-wez; win). Not surprisingly, excited fans react to every khata’ (kah-tah;
foul), often disagreeing with the Hakam (hah-kam; referee).
If you find yourself enjoying kurat al-qadam or a number of other team sports
with a friend who speaks Arabic, the following terms may come in handy:
 malaabis riyaaDiyya (mah-lah-bees ree-yah-dee-yah; uniforms)
 khasar (kah-sar; loss)
145
Chapter 8: Enjoying Yourself: Recreation

 kura (koo-rah; ball)
 laa’ib (lah-eeb; player) (MS)
 laa’iba (lah-ee-bah; player) (FS)
kurat al-qadam is only one of the many sports popular with Arabic speakers
and peoples of the Middle East. Here are some other favorite sports:
 sibaaHa (see-bah-hah; swimming)
 furusiiyya (foo-roo-see-yah; horseback riding)
 kurat aT-Taa’ira (koo-rat ah-tah-ee-rah; volleyball)
 kurat as-salla (koo-rat ah-sah-lah; basketball)
 kurat al-miDrab (koo-rat al-meed-rab; tennis)
 daraaja (dah-rah-jah; cycling)
 tazaHluq (tah-zah-look; skiing)
 tazalluj (tah-zah-looj; ice skating)
 jumbaaz (joo-meh-baz; gymnastics)
 siyaaqat as-sayaara (see-yah-kat ah-sah-yah-rah; racecar driving)
One of the most common verbs used with sports and other recreational
activities is la’aba (lah-ah-bah; play). Because the verb la’aba is commonly
used and important — much like the verb fa’ala — knowing how to conjugate
it in both the maaDii and the muDaari’ is a good idea.
Here’s the verb la’aba in the maaDii form:

The sentence structure for creating verbs is such that you use the verb
la’aba or yal’abu followed by the sport or activity you’re playing. For exam-
ple, you may say ‘anaa ‘al’abu kurat as-salla (I am playing basketball) or hiya
la’abat kurat al-miDrab (She played tennis). As you can see from these exam-
ples, all you do is start with the personal pronoun and verb conjugation,
attach the sport you’re referring to, and voila!
Another important phrase commonly used relating to sports and other fun
activities is hayyaa binaa (hah-yah bee-nah; Let’s go). You’ll often hear
friends telling each other hayyaa binaa followed by the activity or location of
the activity, such as hayyaa binaa ‘ilaa mal’ab kurat al-qadam (hah-yah bee-
nah ee-lah mal-ahb koo-rat al-kah-dam; Let’s go to the soccer field).

Going to the Beach
One of my favorite places is the shaaTi’ (shah-teeh; beach); whether you go to
the shaaTi’ with your ‘aSdiqaa’ (ass-dee-kah; friends) or your ‘usra (oos-rah;
family), it’s a really great place to have a fun time! You can do some sibaaHa
(see-bah-hah; swimming) in the muHiiT (moo-heet; ocean) or play around in
the ramla (rah-meh-lah; sand).

Playing Musical Instruments
I happen to agree with the saying that moosiiqaa (moo-see-kah; music) is a
universal language. No matter where you come from or what languages you
speak, moosiiqaa has the power to break down barriers and bring people
closer together than perhaps any other activity. Popular aalaat moosiiqiyya
(ah-lat moo-see-kee-yah; musical instruments) include:
 biiyaano (bee-yah-noo; piano)
 qiithaar (kee-thar; guitar)
 kamanja (kah-mah-neh-jah; violin)
 Tabl (tah-bel; drums)
 fluut (feh-loot; flute)
 buuq (book; trumpet)
 saaksuufuun (sak-soo-foon; saxophone)
151
Chapter 8: Enjoying Yourself: Recreation

In order to say that someone plays a particular instrument, use the muDaari’
form of the verb yal’abu. For example yal’abu al-qiithaar means “He plays
the guitar” or “He is playing the guitar” because the muDaari’ describes both
an ongoing and a habitual action.
Middle Eastern music is one of the most popular types of music in the world. It
is characterized by a special kind of string instrument called the ‘uud (ood)
that has 12 strings and a round hollow body. The ‘uud is generally accompa-
nied by a number of percussion instruments, such as the regular drum and the
special Tabla (tah-beh-lah) that keeps the beat and adds extra flavor to the ser-
enading of the ‘uud.
A particularly popular kind of Middle Eastern music is Rai (rah-yee), which
originated in the early 90s in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Rai uses a lot of
traditional Arabic instruments such as the ‘uud and the Tabla but adds
modern rock and roll and jazz instruments such as the electric guitar, the sax-
ophone, and the trumpet. One of the most popular singers of Rai music is
Sheb Khaled.
Popular Hobbies
Besides riyaaDa and moosiiqaa, you may enjoy a number of other types of
hobbies. Do you consider qiraa’a (kee-rah-ah; reading) a hiwaaya (hee-wah-
yah; hobby)? Perhaps you’re creative and like rasm (rah-sem; drawing) or
fakhaar (fah-kar; pottery)?
Some other popular hobbies include:
 waraq al-la’ib (wah-rak ah-lah-eeb; cards)
 raqS (rah-kes; dancing)
 shaTranj (sha-teh-rah-nej; chess)
 Hiyaaka (hee-yah-kah; knitting)
 shi’r (shee-ar; poetry)
When you want to discuss hobbies and personal activities, use the verb
la’aba (for conjugations, check out “Sporting an Athletic Side” earlier in this
chapter). For example, you say la’abtu kurat al-qadam (lah-ab-too koo-rat al-
kah-dam; I played soccer) or la’aba al-kamanja (lah-ah-bah al-kah-mah-neh-
jah; He played the violin). Here are some other example sentences that pair
activities with the verb la’aba:
152
Part II: Arabic in Action

 la’abat shaTranj. (lah-ah-bat sha-teh-rah-nej; She played chess.)
 la’abnaa kurat as-salla. (lah-ab-nah koo-rat ah-sah-lah; We played 
basketball.)
 la’abaa waraq al-la’ib. (lah-ah-bah wah-rak ah-lah-eeb; They played
cards.) (dual/MP/FP)
However, there are times when you’re going to use the verb fa’ala. Generally
speaking, the verb fa’ala is used to discuss activities that are more work-
related than hobbies. For instance, you say fa’altu al-waajib (fah-al-too al-
wah-jeeb; I did the homework). As a rule, use the verb la’aba when you’re
discussing hobbies such as sports and playing musical instruments.

Talking on the Phone
In This Chapter
 Beginning a phone conversation
 Making plans over the phone
 Leaving a phone message
P
ersonally, I really enjoy talking on the haatif (haa-teef; phone). It’s a great
way to catch up with friends, make social arrangements, and plan other
aspects of your life with ease. With just a phone, you can get in touch with
anyone in the world and talk about anything you like — from sports to social
events and schoolwork to office gossip!
A few decades ago you may have been limited as to where you could hold a
mukaalama haatifiyya (moo-kaah-la-mah haa-teef-eeya; phone conversation).
Today, with the ubiquity of cell phones and other portable phone units, you
can literally take your conversation anywhere! This flexibility makes knowing
how to hold a phone conversation in Arabic even more important. In this
chapter, I explain how to properly begin and end a mukaalama haatifiyya,
how to make plans over the phone, and how to leave a proper phone mes-
sage in Arabic. With all that information, you can be confident that you’re
carrying on a proper phone conversation like a native speaker!
Dialing Up the Basics
Before you can chat on the haatif (haa-teef; telephone) with your friends like a
native speaker, you need to be familiar with the following basic terminology:
 haatif ‘aam (haa-teef aahm; public phone)
 haatif selulayr (haa-teef seh-loo-layer; cellphone)
 raqm al-haatif (rak-em al-haa-teef; phone number)
 biTaaqat al-haatif (bee-taa-kaht al-haa-teef; phone card)
 mukaalama haatifiyya (moo-kaah-la-mah haa-teef-eeya; phone 
conversation)

156
Part II: Arabic in Action
Beginning a phone conversation
You can begin a phone conversation in a number of ways. The most common,
whether you’re the caller or the person answering the phone, is to simply say
allo (all-low; hello).
It’s proper etiquette to state your name right after the person who picks up
the phone says allo, particularly if you don’t know that person. If you’re the
caller, you may say ‘anaa (an-nah; I am) followed by your name. Alternatively,
you may say haadhaa (M) / haadhihi (F) (haa-zaah / haa-zee-hee; this is) fol-
lowed by your name. A familiar phrase you can also use after you say allo is
‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum (ass-sa-laam-ou a-lai-koum; hello) or ‘ahlan wa sahlan
(ahel-lan wah sahel-lan; hi). Flip to Chapter 3 for more on greetings and
making small talk.

Asking to speak to someone
Sometimes, a person other than the one you want to talk to answers the
phone. A common phrase to help you ask for the person you called to speak
with is hal (insert name here) hunaa? (hal [name] hoo-naah), which means
“Is (name) here?”
Alternatively you can also use the personal pronouns huwa (if the person
you’re looking for is a man) or hiya (in the case of a woman) instead of using
the person’s name.

Making Plans Over the Phone
The phone is useful not only for staying in touch with friends and family but
also for making mawaa’id ‘ijtimaa’iiyya (mah-waah-eed eej-tee-maah-ee-yah;
social arrangements) as well as mawaa’id ‘amalliya (mah-waah-eed ahm-ahl-
ee-yah; business arrangements). This section covers the specific terminology
you need for each of these situations.
Making social plans
If you’re talking with a friend, you’re free to be a bit more informal than if you
were calling a business. Some common words to help you make social
arrangements with your friends are:
 hayyaa binaa! (hah-yaah bee-naah; Let’s go!)
 maT’am (ma-tam; restaurant)
 siiniimaa (see-nee-mah; movie theater)
 matHaf (maht-haf; museum)
 waqt faarigh (wah-ket faa-ree-gh; free time)

I
f you’re like most people living in the modern world, the two places where
you spend the most time probably are your manzil (man-zeel; house) and
your maktab (mak-tab; office). Like many people who are employed by big
companies, small businesses, government agencies, or private ventures, you
divide your waqt (wah-ket; time) between al-’amal (al-ah-mal; work) and
Hayaat al-‘aa’iliiyya (hah-yat al-ah-ee-lee-yah; family life). Achieving tawaazun
(tah-wah-zoon; balance) between the two is extremely crucial for your happi-
ness, your efficiency at the workplace, and your effectiveness in your home.
In this chapter, I cover all the good “work” words you should know and intro-
duce you to all aspects of life at the office and around the house to help you
balance life between these two worlds.
Landing the Perfect Job
At some point in your Hayaat (hah-yat; life), you may want or need to start
working and therefore decide to actively start looking for ‘amal. Identifying a
mihna (meeh-nah; profession) that’s right for you and then going about
securing ‘amal can be a full-time job itself. In this section, you discover the
words and phrases to make your job search as efficient as possible!

One of the first things to keep in mind when you go about your job search is
that you need to find an ‘amal that suits your particular maSlaHaat (mas-lah-
hat; interests) and mahaaraat (mah-hah-rat; skills). You may want to start
your search by talking to ‘aSdiqaa’ (ass-dee-kah; friends) or asking around at
your local jam’iyya (jam-ee-yah; university). Also, you’re likely to find listings
in the following:
 jariidaat (jah-ree-dat; newspapers)
 ma’luumaat (mah-loo-mat; classified ads)
As you search, make sure you find out as much as possible about a potential
mustakhdim (moos-tak-deem; employer). When you’re able to secure an inter-
view with a sharika (shah-ree-kah; company), here’s a list of things you may
want to find out about your potential mustakhdim:
 ‘adad al-‘ummaal (ah-dad al-oo-mal; number of employees)
 Damaan aS-SaHHa (dah-man ah-sah-hah; health insurance)
 raatib (rah-teeb; salary)
 waqt al-‘uTla (wah-ket al-oot-lah; vacation time)
 ta’aaqud (tah-ah-kood; pension)

Managing the Office Environment
The maktab is an essential part of modern life. In most Arabic-speaking and
Muslim countries, ‘ummaal (ooh-mal; workers) work from al-‘ithnayn (al-eeth-
nah-yen; Monday) until al-jumu’a (al-joo-moo-ah; Sunday). Most ‘ummaal
follow a standard as-saa’a at-taasi’a ‘ilaa al-khaamisa (ah-sah-ah ah-tah-see-ah
ee-lah al-kah-mee-sah; 9:00 to 5:00) schedule for workdays.
170
Part II: Arabic in Action

Although most makaatib (mah-kah-teeb; offices) around the world give their
‘ummaaal time for ghadaa’ (gah-dah; lunch), the duration depends on the
employer and the country. For example, in the United States, it’s not uncom-
mon for an ‘aamil (ah-meel; worker) to eat her ghadaa’ while sitting at her
maktab (mak-tab; desk). On the other hand, in most Middle Eastern coun-
tries, an ‘aamil gets two hours for ghadaa’ and is encouraged to eat his
ghadaa’ at his manzil (man-zeel; house) with his ‘usra (oos-rah; family).
Here are some key words and terms to help you navigate the workplace:
 ‘amal (ah-mal; work/job)
 mihna (meeh-nah; profession)
 sharika (shah-ree-kah; company)
 sharika kabiira (shah-ree-kah kah-bee-rah; large company)
 sharika Saghiira (shah-ree-kah sah-gee-rah; small company)
 ma’mal (mah-mal; factory)
 zubuun (zoo-boon; client)
 zabaa’in (zah-bah-een; clients)
You can choose from many different kinds of sharikaat (shah-ree-kat; compa-
nies) to work for, including a maSraf (mas-raf; bank), a sharikat al-Hisaab
(shah-ree-kat al-hee-sab; accounting firm), and a sharikat al-qaanuun (shah-
ree-kat al-kah-noon; law firm). You also have many choices when it comes to
mihan (mee-han; professions). Here are some popular mihan:
 maSrafii (mas-rah-fee; banker) (M)
 maSrafiiya (mas-rah-fee-yah; banker) (F)
 rajul al-‘a’maal (rah-jool al-ah-mal; businessman)
 ‘imra’at al-‘a’maal (eem-rah-at al-ah-mal; businesswoman)
 muHaamiiy (moo-hah-mee; lawyer)
 shurTa (shoor-tah; police officer)
 rajul al-‘iTfaa’ (rah-jool al-eet-fah; firefighter)
Most sharikaat have a lot of ‘ummaal with different responsibilities, and
most ‘ummaal find themselves in daa’iraat (dah-ee-rat; divisions/groups/
departments) within the sharika. Here are some of the common daa’iraat
you may find in a sharika:
171
Chapter 10: At the Office and Around the House

 daa’irat al-Hisaab (dah-ee-rat al-hee-sab; accounting department)
 daa’irat al-‘aswaaq (dah-ee-rat al-as-wak; marketing department)
 daa’irat al-qaanuun (dah-ee-rat al-kah-noon; legal department)
 daa’irat al-’ummaal (dah-ee-rat al-ooh-mal; human resources department)
 daa’irat az-zabaa’in (dah-ee-rat ah-zah-bah-een; customer service 
department)
Interacting with your colleagues
Unless you’re in a mihna that doesn’t require you to interact with people
face-to-face (such as being an author), you need to be able to get along with
your zumalaa’ (zoo-mah-lah; colleagues) at the maktab. This section reveals
the terms that will help you get along with everyone at the office so that you
can be as productive and efficient as possible.
Before you build good working relationships with your zumalaa’, you should
know the right words for classifying them:
 zamiil (zah-meel; colleague) (MS)
 zamiila (zah-mee-lah; colleague) (FS)
 zumalaat (zoo-mah-lat; colleagues) (FP)
 mudiir (moo-deer; director) (MS)
 mudiira (moo-dee-rah; director) (FS)
 mudiiruun (moo-dee-roon; directors) (MP)
 mudiiraat (moo-dee-rat; directors) (FP)
 ra’iis (rah-ees; president) (MS)
 ra’iisa (rah-ee-sah; president) (FS)
 ru’asaa’ (roo-ah-sah; presidents) (MP)
 ru’asaat (roo-ah-sat; presidents) (FP)
Whether you like it or not, your zumalaa’ al-maktab (zoo-mah-lah al-mak-tab;
office colleagues) have a big influence over your time at the maktab; therefore,
getting along with your zumalaa’ is crucial. You can address people you work
with in a number of different ways, such as based on rank, age, or gender.
These categorizations may seem discriminatory in an American sense, but
these terms actually carry the utmost respect for the person being referenced:
172
Part II: Arabic in Action

 Use sayyidii (sah-yee-dee; sir) to address the mudiir or someone with a
higher rank than you.
 Use sayiidatii (sah-yee-dah-tee; madam) to address the mudiira or ra’iisa.
 Use Sadiiqii (sah-dee-kee; friend) to address a male colleague.
 Use Sadiiqatii (sah-dee-kah-tee; friend) to address a zamiila.
 Use al-‘akh (al-ak; brother) to address a co-worker or colleague.
 Use al-‘ukht (al-oo-ket; sister) to address a zamiila.
In Arabic culture, it’s okay to address co-workers or people close to you as
‘akh (brother) or ‘ukht (sister) even though they may not be related to you.
Here are some phrases to help you interact cordially and politely with your
zumalaa’:
 hal turiid musaa’ada? (hal too-reed moo-sah-ah-dah; Do you need 
help?) (M)
 hal turiidiina musaa’ada? (hal too-ree-dee-nah moo-sah-ah-dah; Do you
need help?) (F)
 hal yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’iduka bii dhaalika? (hal yoom-keen an oo-sah-ee-
doo-kah bee zah-lee-kah; May I help you with that?) (M)
 hal yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’idukii bii dhaalika? (hal yoom-keen an oo-sah-ee-
doo-kee bee zah-lee-kah; May I help you with that?) (F)
 sa ‘adhhab ‘ilaa al-maT’am. hal turiid shay’an? (sah az-hab ee-lah 
al-mat-ham. hal too-ree-doo shay-an; I’m going to the cafeteria. Do you
want anything?) (M)
 sa ‘adhhab ‘ilaa al-maT’am. hal turiidiina shay’an? (sah az-hab ee-lah
al-mat-ham. hal too-ree-dee-nah shay-an; I’m going to the cafeteria. Do you
want anything?) (F)
 ‘indanaa ‘ijtimaa’ fii khams daqaa’iq. (een-dah-nah eej-tee-mah fee 
kah-mes dah-kah-eek; We have a meeting in five minutes.)
 az-zabuun saya’tii fii saa’a. (ah-zah-boon sah-yah-tee fee sah-ah; The
client will arrive in one hour.)
 hal waSaluka bariidii al-‘iliktroonii? (hal wah-sah-loo-kah bah-ree-dee 
al-ee-leek-troo-nee; Did you get my e-mail?)
 hal waSaluka khabaarii al-haatifiiy? (hal wah-sah-loo-kah kah-bah-ree 
al-hah-tee-fee; Did you get my phone message?)
 hal ‘indaka qalam? (hal een-dah-kah kah-lam; Do you have a pen?) (M)
 hal ‘indukii qalam? (hal een-doo-kee kah-lam; Do you have a pen?) (F)

Giving orders
The imperative verb form, also known as the command form, is used to give
orders or directions. It’s an important verb to know in the workplace because
that’s where you’re usually told what to do and where you tell others what to
do. The imperative structure is fairly straightforward. This section shares
some quick tips to allow you to master the imperative form.
First, because the imperative is a command form, you can use it only with
present personal pronouns such as ‘anta (an-tah; you) (M) and ‘anti (an-tee;
you) (F). You can’t used the imperative with absent personal pronouns such
as huwa (hoo-wah; him) because you can’t give an order to someone who
isn’t present. The following is a list of the personal pronouns to use with the
imperative:
 ‘anta (an-tah; you) (MS)
 ‘anti (an-tee; you) (FS)
 ‘antum (an-toom; you) (MP)
 ‘antunna (an-too-nah; you) (FP)
 ‘antumaa (an-too-mah; you) (dual)
Second, the imperative form is nothing but a derived form of the regular verb
in the maaDii (mah-dee; past) and the muDaari’ (moo-dah-reeh; present)
tenses. The following is a list of the most common imperative verbs:
 ‘uktub (ook-toob; write)
 ‘iqra’ (eek-rah; read)
 ‘unDHur (oon-zoor; look)
 ‘a’id (ah-eed; repeat)
 qull (kool; say)
 ‘u’kul (ooh-kool; eat)
 takallam (tah-kah-lam; speak)
 qif (keef; stop)
 taHarrak (tah-hah-rak; move)
One of the more important verb command forms is the verb kataba (kah-tah-
bah; to write). Table 10-1 shows the imperative (command form) of the verb
kataba.

 maktab (mak-tab; desk)
 ‘aalat al-Hisaab (ah-lat al-hee-sab; computer)
 haatif (hah-teef; telephone)
 ‘aalat al-faks (ah-lat al-fah-kes; fax machine)

Besides ‘aalaat (ah-lat; machines) and heavy furniture, you also need smaller
tools to help you get by at the maktab:

 qalam ar-rasaas (kah-lam ah-rah-sas; pencil)
 mimHaat (meem-hat; eraser)
 kitaab (kee-tab; book)
 daftar (daf-tar; notebook)
 ‘awraaq (aw-rak; papers)
 mishbak ‘awraaq (meesh-bak aw-rak; paper clip)
 Dammat ‘awraaq (dah-mat aw-rak; stapler)
 liSaaq (lee-sak; glue)
 skooch (seh-koo-tech; tape)
If you can’t find a daftar or liSaaq, ask a zumalaa’ if you can borrow one.
Here’s how you ask a colleague a question, depending on whether you’re
speaking to a man or a woman:
 hal ‘indakii daftar? (hal een-dah-kee daf-tar; Do you have a notebook?) (F)
 hal ‘indaka liSaaq? (hal een-dah-kah lee-sak; Do you have glue?) (M)
 hal ‘indakum skooch? (hal een-dah-koom seh-koo-tech; Do you have
tape?) (MP)
 hal ‘indahu qalam? (hal een-dah-hoo kah-lam; Does he have a pen?)
The construct “to have” in Arabic isn’t a verb (see the preceding list of exam-
ples); rather it’s a combination of possessive suffix constructions added to the
word ‘inda (een-dah), which is the best word in the language to denote pos-
session. However, for all intents and purposes, you may use this construct —
‘inda followed by a possessive suffix — in the same way as you would a 
regular verb. Check out this prepositional phrase using all personal pronoun

Life at Home
If you’re like most people, you spend a lot of time at your manzil (man-zeel;
house). The manzil is a bit different than the bayt (bah-yet; home) because a
manzil can be any old manzil, whereas the bayt is the space where you feel
most comfortable. In many cultures, a manzil is a family’s or individual’s
most prized possession or asset. Due to the centrality of the bayt and manzil
in everyday life, knowing how to talk about them in-depth can be very useful.
In this section, I tell you all the right words and terms to help you talk about
your manzil!
As you know, a manzil consists of ghuraf (roo-raf; rooms). In singular form,
“room” is known as ghurfa (roor-fah) in Arabic. This list should help you
become familiar with the major types of ghuraf in a manzil:
 ghurfat al-juluus (goor-fat al-joo-loos; sitting room)
 ghurfat al-ma’iisha (goor-fat al-mah-ee-shah; living room)
 ghurfat al-‘akl (goor-fat al-ah-kel; dining room)
181
Chapter 10: At the Office and Around the House

 ghurfat an-nawm (goor-fat ah-nah-wem; bedroom)
 Hammaam (hah-mam; bathroom)
 ghurfat al-ghasl (goor-fat al-gah-sel; washing/laundry room)
 maTbakh (mat-bak; kitchen)
In addition to ghuraf, a manzil may also have a karaaj (kah-raj; garage) where
you can park your sayyaara (sah-yah-rah; car) as well as a bustaan (boos-tan;
garden) where you can play or just relax. Some manaazil (mah-nah-zeel;
houses) even have a masbaH (mas-bah; swimming pool).
Each ghurfa in the manzil usually contains different items. For example, you
can expect to find a sariir (sah-reer; bed) in a ghurfat an-nawm. Here are
some items you can expect to find in the Hammaam:
 mirHaaD (meer-had; toilet)
 duush (doosh; shower)
 maghsal (mag-sal; sink)
 shawkat al-‘asnaan (shaw-kat al-ass-nan; toothbrush)
 ghasuul as-sha’r (gah-sool ah-shah-er; shampoo)
 Saabuun (sah-boon; soap)
 mir’aat (meer-at; mirror)
You can expect to find the following items in the maTbakh:
 furn (foo-ren; stove)
 tannuur (tah-noor; oven)
 thallaaja (tah-lah-jah; refrigerator)
 zubaala (zoo-bah-lah; trash can)
 shawkaat (shaw-kat; forks)
 malaa’iq (mah-lah-eek; spoons)
 sakaakiin (sah-kah-keen; knives)
 ku’uus (koo-oos; glasses)
 ‘aTbaaq (at-bak; dishes)

Chapter 10: At the Office and Around the House
Family life in a Middle Eastern home
In most Arabic-speaking and Islamic countries,
the bayt (bah-yet; home) plays a very central
role in family life. Unlike in Western countries,
the ‘usra (oos-rah; family) structure in the bayt
generally consists of more than the parents and
children (the typical nuclear family); it extends
to other members of the family, such as grand-
parents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. Therefore,
a bayt in most Middle Eastern countries houses
not only parents and their children but also
grandparents, grandchildren, cousins, and other
family members.
In countries such as Saudi Arabia, manaazil
(mah-nah-zeel; houses) are built to accommo-
date up to 10 or 15 family members and some-
times more. Like houses in the United States,
Europe, and other parts of the world, the Middle
Eastern home revolves around the ghurfat al-
ma’iisha (living room). Physically and architec-
turally, the ghurfat al-ma’iisha is the central part
of the manzil; it’s usually surrounded by the
maTbakh (kitchen) and the ghurfat al-juluus
(sitting room) and ghurfat al-’akl (dining room).
Often times, it’s the largest room in the manzil
and is accessible through different ghuraf.
During the ‘iid (eed; holidays), the bayt becomes
a place where family members come and cele-
brate the festivities together. The ghurfat al-ma’i-
isha retains its centrality during these festivities,
although other parts of the manzil become more
significant, such as the ghurfat al-’akl and the
bustaan (garden).

Hassan looks for the remote control on the dining room table but
can’t find it.
Hassan:

Chapter 11
Money, Money, Money
In This Chapter
 Handling financial matters at the bank
 Understanding ATM commands
 Changing your currency
a
l-maal (al-mal; money) is an essential part of everyday life. Whether
you’re in a foreign country or at home, having access to maal is neces-
sary in order to do the things you need to do — buy food, buy clothes, pay
rent, go to the movies, and so on. Because very few activities in this world
are majjaanan (mah-jah-nan; free), in this chapter you discover the Arabic
terminology you need to manage your financial life. Specifically, I tell you how
to open and maintain a bank account, how to withdraw money from the bank
as well as from an automated teller machine (ATM), and how to exchange
currency in case you travel to different countries.
At the Bank
The source of al-maal is the maSraf (mas-raf; bank); conveniently another word
for “bank” in Arabic is al-banka or simply banka. In this section, you become
familiar with some of the items you find and transactions that take place at the
maSraf. Here are some common terms associated with the maSraf:
 fuluus (foo-loos; cash/physical currency)
 nuquud (noo-kood; money/coins)
 naqd (nah-ked; coin)
 ‘awraaq (aw-rak; money/paper currencies)
 biTaaqa al-‘i’timaad (bee-tah-kah al-eeh-tee-mad; credit card)
 biTaaqaat al-‘i’timaad (bee-tah-kat al-eeh-tee-mad; credit cards)

 biTaaqa al-‘istilaaf (bee-tah-kah al-ees-tee-laf; debit card)
 shiik (sheek; check)
 shiikaat (shee-kat; checks)
 Hisaab maSrafii (hee-sab mas-rah-fee; bank account)
Opening a bank account
One of the most important things you may do in a maSraf is open a Hisaab
maSrafii (bank account). Depending on your current financial situation and
your future economic needs, you may open different types of Husub
maSrafiiyya (hoo-soob mas-rah-fee-yah; bank accounts). Here are some of the
types of Husub (hoo-soob; accounts) you may inquire about:
 Hisaab maSrafii ‘aadii (hee-sab mas-rah-fee ah-dee; checking account)
 Hisaab maSrafii li at-tawfiir (hee-sab mas-rah-fee lee ah-taw-feer; savings
account)
 Hisaab maSrafii li at-tawfiir wa at-taqaa’ud (hee-sab mas-rah-fee lee 
ah-taw-feer wah ah-tah-kah-ood; retirement savings account)
 Hisaab maSrafii li aT-Tulaab (hee-sab mas-rah-fee lee ah-too-lab; student
checking account)
After you determine which type of Hisaab is right for you, you’re ready to
talk to the ‘amiin al-maSraf (ah-meen al-mas-raf; bank teller) (M) or the
‘amiina al-masraf (ah-mee-nah al-mas-raf; bank teller) (F) to open your
Hisaab. The ‘amiin al-maSraf or ‘amiina al-maSraf may ask you to step into
his or her maktab (mak-tab; office) in order to ensure your shakhsiiyya (shak-
see-yah; privacy), because futuuH (foo-tooh; opening) a Hisaab must be done
securely.

Presenting your ID
After you decide which Hisaab is right for you, you need to take care of some
initial paperwork. You must present a number of wathaa’iq (wah-tah-eek; doc-
uments) and then answer a few ‘as’ila (ass-ee-lah; questions). Here are some
of the wathaa’iq you should have with you when you want to open a Hisaab:
 biTaaqa shakhsiyya (bee-tah-kah shak-see-yah; personal identification
card)
 biTaaqat as-saa’iq (bee-tah-kat ah-sah-eek; driver’s license)
 jawaaz as-safar (jah-waz ah-sah-far; passport)
 biTaaqat at-tilmiidh (bee-tah-kat ah-teel-meez; student identification card)
 biTaaqat raqm al-‘amn ash-shakhsiiy (bee-tah-kat rah-kem al-ah-men 
ah-shak-see; social security card)
Providing your contact info
After you establish your identity by presenting various personal identifica-
tion cards, the ‘amiin al-maSraf will probably ask you for some more
wathaa’iq so that he can process your application. For example, he may ask
193
______________________________________ Chapter 11: Money, Money, Money

for your ‘unwaan ar-raahin (oon-wan ah-rah-heen; current address) or your
‘unwaan as-saabiq (oon-wan ah-sah-beek; former address). Of course, in
order to prove that you actually do live where you say you live, the ‘amiin 
al-maSraf may ask you for a risaala (ree-sah-lah; letter) addressed to you at
your ‘unwaan (address).
Filling out the forms
After you provide the wathaa’iq that the ‘amiin al-maSraf requests, you usu-
ally receive an ‘istimaarat aT-Talab (ees-tee-mah-rat ah-tah-lab; application
form) to fill out. Here are some items you’re likely to find on the ‘istimaarat
aT-Talab:
 ‘ism shakhsii (ee-sem shak-see; first name)
 ‘ism ‘aa’ilii (ee-sem ah-ee-lee; last name/family name)
 taariikh al-miilaad (tah-reek al-mee-lad; date of birth)
 makaan al-miilaad (mah-kan al-mee-lad; place of birth)
 al-mihna (al-meeh-nah; occupation)
 al-mustakhdim (al-moos-tak-deem; employer)
 taariikh al-‘amal (tah-reek al-ah-mal; work history)
 naw’ al-Hisaab (nah-weh al-hee-sab; type of account)
 raqm al-haatif (rah-kem al-hah-teef; telephone number)
After you fill out the ‘istimaarat aT-Talab, the ‘amiin al-maSraf will ask for
your ‘imdaa’ (eem-dah; signature) on the document. When you finish with all
the paperwork and have successfully opened your bank account, you’re
ready to start using it!

Making deposits and withdrawals
After you open your Hisaab, the two most basic transactions you’ll probably
make are:
 wadii’a (wah-dee-ah; deposit)
 ‘insiHaab (een-see-hab; withdrawal)
To make a wadii’a, you may deposit into your Hisaab maSrafii (bank account)
using a shiik (check) or fuluus (cash). You may go to the ‘amiin al-maSraf to
make the wadii’a or do it yourself at an ATM, if your bank allows that.
Similarly, you may perform a ‘insiHaab by either going to the ‘amiin al-maSraf
or by using the ATM.
Using the ATM
In recent years, the number of ATMs located around the world has mush-
roomed, and in places like New York City, you can’t walk half a block without
spotting one. Whether you’re in the United States, the Middle East, or other
countries or regions of the world, there’s a good chance that you’ll use an
ATM to withdraw fuluus. This section covers the terminology you encounter
at an ATM to help make this a smooth and efficient transaction.
Most ATMs accept all sorts of cards, whether they’re issued by the same
maSraf that operates the ATM terminal or not. However, some ATMs charge
you a ‘ujra (ooj-rah; fee) if you use a card not issued by a recognized maSraf.
In addition, most ATMs accept both biTaaqaat al-‘i’timaad (credit cards) and
biTaaqaat al-‘istilaaf (debit cards). Note: Another word for “credit card” is
biTaaqa diiniiya (bee-tah-kah dee-nee-yah).
Although most ATMs let you choose the language you want to conduct your
transaction in, you should still be aware of ATM-related commands and
phrases in Arabic:
 ‘udkhul al-biTaaqa (ood-kool al-bee-tah-kah; Insert the card.)
 ‘udkhul ar-raqm as-siriiy. (ood-kool ah-rah-kem ah-see-ree; Enter the
PIN/secret number.)
 ‘insiHaab al-fuluus (een-see-hab al-foo-loos; cash withdrawal)
 ‘udkhul al-kammiyya. (ood-kool al-kah-mee-yah; Enter the amount.)
 ‘akkid al-kammiyya. (ah-keed al-kah-mee-yah; Confirm the amount.)
 khudh al-fuluus. (kooz al-foo-loos; Take the cash.)
Part III: Arabic on the Go ____________________________________________
198

 hal turiidu ‘iiSaala? (hal too-ree-doo ee-sah-lah; Do you want a receipt?)
 khudh al-‘iiSaala. (kooz al-ee-sah-lah; Take the receipt.)
 Haqqiq ar-raSiid. (hah-keek ah-rah-seed; Check the balance.)
 Hawwil al-amwaal. (hah-weel al-am-wal; Transfer the money.)
 ‘azil al-biTaaqa min faDlik. (ah-zeel al-bee-tah-kah meen fad-leek; Please
remove the card.)
Exchanging Currency
If you’re traveling to a foreign dawla (dah-ou-lah; country), you won’t get very
far if you don’t have the right ‘umla mutadaawala (oom-lah moo-tah-dah-wah-
lah; currency), or ‘umla (oom-lah) for short. (Of course, you could rely on
shiikat al-musaafir (shee-kat al-moo-sah-feer; traveler’s checks), but you may
find that carrying ‘umla is more convenient.) You can exchange ‘umla at a
number of different places. If you like to plan in advance, then stopping by
the maSraf before your safar (sah-far; trip) is a good idea. Otherwise, you can
go to a maktab as-sarf (mak-tab ah-sah-ref; exchange desk) located at the
maTaar (mah-tar; airport).
You’re likely to get better exchange rates in your home country at your local
bank than at an airport in a foreign country. If you’re visiting a foreign coun-
try and need to change money, then the best way for you to exchange curren-
cies is to go to a reputable bank of international renown and make your
transactions there.
Getting to know the currencies 
around the world
In order to exchange your money, you need to be familiar with the different
types of currencies you’re dealing with. The following lists feature some of
the most common currencies grouped by specific regions around the world.
The following currencies are used in the Middle East:
 Algeria: diinaar jazaa’irii (dee-nar jah-zah-ee-ree; Algerian dinar)

 USA: duulaar ‘amriikiiy (doo-lar am-ree-kee; American dollar)
Only two currencies are used in Europe:

Asking for Directions
In This Chapter
 Asking and answering “where” questions
 Clarifying directions
 Exploring ordinal numbers
B
eing able to ask for — and understand — ‘ittijaahaat (ee-tee-jah-hat;
directions) is an important skill, particularly if you’re traveling in an
Arabic-speaking country. In order to interact with and get assistance from
native Arabic speakers, you need to know how to ask questions that will
help you get where you want to be. And you also need to understand the 
‘ittijaahaat that are being given to you!
In this chapter, I tell you how to interact with native speakers in order to get
relevant information to help you find what you’re looking for!
Focusing on the “Where”
In order to ask for and give directions, you need to be able to answer and ask
“where” questions. In this section, I tell you how to do just that.
Asking “where” questions
The best way to get directions-related information from Arabic speakers is to
ask ‘ayna (eh-yeh-nah; where) questions. Luckily, the structure of an ‘ayna
question is relatively straightforward: You use ‘ayna followed by the subject.
For example:
 ‘ayna al-funduq? (eh-yeh-nah al-foon-dook; Where is the hotel?)
 ‘ayna al-haatif? (eh-yeh-nah al-haa-teef; Where is the phone?)
 ‘ayna al-mirHaaD? (eh-yeh-nah al-meer-haad; Where is the bathroom?)

Be sure to define the subject following ‘ayna. As I explain in Chapter 3, you
define a subject by adding the definite article prefix al- to the subject noun.
For example, funduq means “hotel,” and al-funduq means “the hotel.” So if
you’re asking where the hotel is located, you say, ‘ayna al-funduq? (Where is
the hotel?) and not ‘ayna funduq?, which translates to “Where is hotel?”
“Where” questions are useful for more than just asking for directions. You
may also apply the ‘ayna question format to human subjects, such as friends
or family. For instance:
 ‘ayna maryam? (eh-yeh-nah mee-ree-yam; Where is Myriam?)
 ‘ayna al-‘aTfaal? (eh-yeh-nah al-aht-faal; Where are the children?)
 ‘ayna ‘ummii? (eh-yeh-nah ooh-meey; Where is my mom?)
You don’t need to use the definite article al- when referring to a noun that’s
already defined. For instance, in one of the preceding examples, maryam
doesn’t require the definite article prefix al- because she’s a specific person.
So make sure that you don’t go around adding the prefix al- to every subject
after ‘ayna because sometimes there’s no question about what subject you’re
referring to.
Answering “where” questions
Asking a “where” question is fairly straightforward (see the preceding 
section), but answering ‘ayna questions isn’t always as clear-cut. You
can answer an ‘ayna question in a number of different ways, ranging from
the simple to the convoluted. In order to answer ‘ayna questions, you have
to understand the structure of the ‘ayna question reply, which usually fol-
lows this format: subject, preposition, object.
Take a look at some common ‘ayna questions and their corresponding replies:
 ‘ayna al-mustashfaa? (eh-yeh-nah al-moos-tash-faah; Where is the hospital?)
al-mustashfaa fii al-madiina. (al-moos-tash-faah fee al-mah-dee-nah; The
hospital is in the city.)
 ‘ayna al-maT’am? (eh-yeh-nah al-mah-tam; Where is the restaurant?)
al-maT’am qariib min al-funduq. (al-mah-tam kah-reeb meen al-foon-dook;
The restaurant is close to the hotel.)
 ‘ayna al-kitaab? (eh-yeh-nah al-kee-taab; Where is the book?)
a-kitaab taHta aT-Taawila. (al-kee-taab tah-tah at-tah-wee-lah; The book is
underneath the table.)
Part III: Arabic on the Go ____________________________________________
206

Notice that in these examples, you use a preposition to establish a connec-
tion between the subject (in this case, what or who you’re looking for) and
the object (the location of the desired subject). In order to establish the
desired relationship, it’s very important for you to be familiar with some
common prepositions:
 ‘alaa (ah-laah; on)
 fii (fee; in)
 ‘ilaa (ee-laah; to)
 qariib min (kah-reeb meen; close to)
 ba’id min (bah-eed meen; far from)
 bijaanib (bee-jaah-neeb; next to)
 fawqa (faw-kah; on top of)
 taHta (tah-tah; underneath/below)
 ‘amaama (ah-maah-mah; in front of)
 waraa’a (wah-raah-ah; behind)
 yamiin min (yah-meen meen; right of)
 yasiir min (yah-seer meen; left of)
Recall that the subject in the ‘ayna interrogatory sentence must be defined
(see “Asking ‘where’ questions” earlier in the chapter for details); similarly,
the subject in the reply to an ‘ayna question must also be defined. In addi-
tion, the object in the ‘ayna reply statement should be defined as well, either
by using the definite article prefix al- or by including a predefined object.
Getting Direction About Directions
Understanding the format of the ‘ayna question and reply structures is an
important first step toward approaching native Arabic speakers and asking
them for directions.
Asking for directions
Of course, you can’t just go up to someone and ask them bluntly, ‘ayna 
al-funduq? (Where is the hotel?). That wouldn’t be very polite. The proper 
etiquette for approaching someone and asking for directions is to first say 
207
______________________________________ Chapter 12: Asking for Directions

as-salaamu ‘alaykum (ah-sah-lah-moo ah-lay-koom; hello) or ‘ahlan wa sahlan
(ah-hel-an wah sah-hel-an; hi) and then ask if he or she would permit you to
ask a question. For example, you begin the exchange by saying, ‘afwan. hal
yumkin ‘an ‘as’alaka su’aalan? (ahf-wan. hal yoom-keen an ass-ah-lah-kah
soo-aah-lan; Excuse me. May I ask you a question?).
After the person agrees to take your question, you may proceed to ask for
directions. (For more information on greetings and introductions, see
Chapter 3.)

Could you repeat that?
Sometimes, when you ask for directions, the person who tries to help
you starts talking too fast and you can’t quite understand what he or she
is saying. Other times, you may be in a loud area, such as near a downtown
traffic jam, and you can’t make out what the other person is saying. In either
case, you have to ask the person who’s giving you directions to speak more
slowly or to repeat what he or she has just said. These phrases can help you
cope with these situations:

Using command forms
When you ask someone for directions, the person directs you to a specific
location. Essentially, he or she tells you where to go, which qualifies as a com-
mand form. The command form is uniform, which means it applies to all per-
sonal pronouns. However, the command form is gender-defined, which means
that you use different commands for men and women. Here are some
common command forms:
Masculine Command
Feminine Command
‘a’id (ah-eed; repeat)
‘a’idii (ah-eed-ee; repeat)
‘idhhab (eez-hab; go)
‘idhhabii (eez-hab-ee; go)
khudh (khooz; take)
khudhii (khooz-ee; take)
Tuf (toof; turn)
Tufii (toof-ee; turn)
qif (keef; stop)
qifii (keef-ee; stop)
Note: ‘imshii (eem-shee; walk) is a special command form that is gender-neutral.

Discovering Ordinal Numbers
Ordinal numbers are used to order things in a first-second-third kind of format.
Unlike cardinal numbers, which are mostly used for counting, you use ordinals
when giving directions. For example, you would tell someone to “turn right on
the second street” and not “turn right on two street.” Hear the difference?
Ordinal numbers in Arabic are gender-defined, so you need to be familiar with
both the masculine and feminine ordinal forms, which I present in Table 12-1.

If you want to tell a friend that your house is “the fifth house,” you say, 
al-manzil al-khaamis (al-man-zeel al-khah-mees). Note that you use the 
masculine ordinal form khaamis because manzil is a masculine noun subject.
To say that you’re taking the “eighth bus,” you would say, ash-shaahina ath-
thaamina (ash-aahee-nah ah-thah-mee-nah). The ordinal thaamina is feminine
because shaahina (bus) is a feminine noun subject.
So if you want to tell your friend to “turn left on the second street,” you say,
Tuf ‘ilaa al-yasiir fii aT-Tariiq ath-thaanee (toof eel-ah al-yah-seer fee at-tah-
reek ah-thah-nee). Because Tariiq (tah-reek; street) is a masculine subject, the
corresponding ordinal thaanee (second) should also be masculine.

Chapter 13
Staying at a Hotel
In This Chapter
 Hunting for the right accommodation
 Reserving your room
 Checking in and out
P
icking the right funduq (foon-dook; hotel) for you and your family or
friends can sometimes make or break your safar (sah-far; trip). During 
a safar or riHla (reeh-lah; vacation), the funduq is your home away from
home — it’s where you get up in the morning and sleep at night, and it can
serve as a base for you to regroup before facing daily adventures. So choosing
the funduq that’s right for you is very important.
In this chapter, I show you the ins and outs of choosing the right funduq to
meet your travel, budgetary, and personal needs. You find out how to inquire
about specific aspects of the funduq (such as available amenities and proxim-
ity to the city center), how to make a room reservation and check into your
room, how to interact with the funduq staff, and, last but not least, how to suc-
cessfully check out of your hotel room! You find out everything you ever
wanted to know about funduq life, and more!
Choosing the Right Accommodation
When choosing the right funduq, you need to consider a number of factors.
First and foremost, you must figure out what kind of hotel you want to stay in.
With so many options to choose from, how do you know which funduq is right
for you? Here are some details to consider:
 thaman (tah-man; price)
 ghurfa (roor-fah; room)
 Hajem al-ghurfa (hah-jem al-goor-fah; room size)
 naw’ al-ghurfa (nah-ouh al-goor-fah; room type)
 khidmat al-ghurfa (keed-mat al-goor-fah; room service)
 ‘iiwaa’ (ee-wah; accommodations)

Of course, you have many other factors to consider, but these are some of
the more popular ones. Not only do you need to find the right funduq, one
that perhaps includes such maraafiq (mah-rah-feek; amenities) as a masbaH
(mas-bah; swimming pool) or a maT’am (mat-ham; restaurant), but you also
need to make sure you find the right ghurfa (room). After all, that’s where
you’ll spend most of your private time.
An important factor to think about when finding a ghurfa is its Hajem (size).
For example, if you’re traveling alone, a ghurfa li-shakhS waaHid (goor-fah
lee-sha-kes wah-heed; single room) is more appropriate than a ghurfa li-
shakhsayn (goor-fah lee-shak-sayn; double room). When inquiring about a
ghurfa, you may need to use the following terms:
 sariir (sah-reer; bed)
 mirHaad (meer-had; toilet)
 balcoon (bal-koon; balcony)
 tilifizyoon (tee-lee-feez-yoon; television)
 Tabaq (tah-bak; floor/level)
To create a possessive noun in the English language, you usually use an apos-
trophe, such as “the girl’s cat” or “the woman’s house.” It’s the same in Arabic,
except that you reverse the word order — you use an undefined noun followed
by a defined noun, as in Hajem al-ghurfa. al-ghurfa (a definite noun because it
contains the definite article prefix al-) means “the room,” and Hajem (an unde-
fined noun) means “size.” So when you read or hear Hajem al-ghurfa, you auto-
matically know that the ghurfa is the possessor acting on the Hajem (size) to
express the “room’s size” or, literally, “the size of the room.”

Getting to know direct object pronouns
Direct object pronouns ascribe possession to a particular individual or group
of individuals, as in “his room,” “her cat,” or “their house.” In Arabic, instead
of using a separate possessive word such as “his,” “her,” or “their,” you add a 
possessive direct object pronoun suffix to the noun to which you’re ascribing
possession.
For example, if you want to say “his room” in Arabic, you take the noun for
“room” (ghurfa) and add the direct object pronoun suffix corresponding to
“his,” which is the suffix -hu. So “his room” in Arabic is ghurfatuhu. Note that
because ghurfa is a feminine singular noun, it automatically ends in a taa
marbuuTa — the silent “t” located at the end of every feminine singular 
noun — and you must also add a Damma — the oo sound (u) — to the end 
of the word before placing the suffix -hu. So instead of saying ghurfahu, you
say ghurfatuhu.
If you want to say “her room,” follow the same rule except that instead of
adding the masculine possessive suffix -hu, you add the feminine possessive
suffix -haa. Hence, “her room” is ghurfatuhaa. This rule applies to all singular
possessive direct object pronouns, but you must pay close attention when
using the possessive suffix in the plural form. For example, to say “their
room,” you must first determine the gender of “their” — whether it’s mascu-
line plural or feminine plural; the plural possessive suffix is gender-defined,
meaning it changes based on the gender. “Their room” in the masculine is
ghurfatuhum (-hum is the masculine plural possessive suffix). Alternatively,
“their room” in the feminine is ghurfatuhunna (you add the feminine plural
possessive suffix -hunna).
Table 13-1 contains all direct object pronoun possessive suffixes, so feel free
to turn to this table whenever you’re looking to add a possessive suffix to a
particular noun but aren’t sure which possessive suffix to use.

regardless of the gender!
Making a Reservation
After you identify the right funduq with the right maraafiq and ghurfa, you’re
ready to make a Hajzu (haj-zoo; reservation)! Before you do, though, you have
a few considerations to make, such as the duration and length of your stay,
the number and type of ghuraf you’re reserving, the number of people stay-
ing, and the cost to stay at the funduq. This section explores all these ele-
ments in-depth so that you can be prepared to make a smooth Hajzu and
secure the best accommodation for your safar!
Figuring out the price
thaman (tah-man; price) is an important factor to think about before you
make your Hajzu. Fortunately, there are many accommodation options to suit
every mizaaniya (mee-zah-nee-yah; budget). If you can afford it, making a
Hajzu in a funduq faakhir (foon-dook fah-kheer; luxury hotel) is nice. These
five-star hotels tend to have all sorts of maraafiq, and you’re sure to get the
star treatment from the hotel staff; a funduq faakhir almost guarantees a
great experience. If you’re a Taalib (tah-leeb; student) or someone with a lim-
ited mizaaniya, staying at a daar aT-Talaba (dar ah-tah-lah-bah; youth hostel)
is a more-affordable option. Hostels tend to have very basic maraafiq, such
as communal bathrooms and shared living space, but are fine if you’re not
planning to spend that much waqt (wah-ket; time) in the funduq.
Part III: Arabic on the Go
224

When making your Hajzu, be sure to inquire about any special tanziilaat (tan-
zee-lat; discounts) that the funduq might be offering. Here are some tanzi-
ilaat you can ask about:
 tanziilaat al-majmoo’aat (tan-zee-lat al-maj-moo-at; group discounts)
 tanziilaat as-saa’aat baTaala (tan-zee-lat ah-sah-at bah-tah-lah; off-peak
discounts)
 tanziilaat al-fuSul (tan-zee-lat al-foo-sol; seasonal discounts)
When you inquire about the thaman, ask about any rayTaat as-safar (ray-tat
ah-sah-far; special travel packages) that the funduq may offer, such as local
sightseeing expeditions. Many hotels now offer these kinds of packages in
addition to basic room and board accommodations. If you don’t ask, you may
miss out on a good deal!

Chapter 13: Staying at a Hotel

Indicating the length of your stay
Making sure you get the room you want when you need it is as important as
sticking to your funduq budget. Securing a ghurfa can be difficult, particu-
larly during the faSl al-‘uTla (fah-sel al-oot-lah; holiday season); therefore, it’s
advisable you make your Hajzu ahead of schedule so that you’re assured to get
the ghurfa you want during the mudda (moo-dah; period) of your choosing.
In order to say you’re going to stay at the funduq “for a period of” so much
time, use the following formula: li muddat (lee moo-dat) followed by the dura-
tion of your stay. For example, to say you’re staying “for a period of a week,”
say li muddat ‘usbuu’ (lee moo-dat oos-booh). Here are some other examples:
 li muddat yawm (lee moo-dat yah-oum; for a period of one day)
 li muddat shahr (lee moo-dat shah-her; for a period of one month)
 li muddat ‘usbuu’ayn (lee moo-dat oos-boo-ayn; for a period of two weeks)
 li muddat khamsat ‘ayyam (lee moo-dat kam-sat ah-yam; for a period of
five days)
 li muddat ‘usbuu’ wa niSf (lee moo-dat oos-booh wah nee-sef; for a
period of one and a half weeks)
To say that you’re staying from one date until another date, use the preposi-
tions min (meen; from) and ‘ilaa (ee-lah; until). For example, if you’re staying
“from Monday until Thursday,” you say min al-‘ithnayn ‘ilaa al-khamiis
(meen al-eeth-nayn ee-lah al-kah-mees). Here are some other examples:
 min al-‘arbi’aa’ ‘ilaa al-’aHad (meen al-ar-bee-ah ee-lah al-ah-had; from
Thursday until Sunday)
 min ‘ishriin yulyuu ‘ilaa thalaathiin yulyuu (meen eesh-reen yool-yoo
ee-lah thah-lah-theen yool-yoo; from July 20 until July 30)
 min ghusht ‘ilaa sibtambar (meen goo-shet ee-lah seeb-tam-bar; from
August until September)
The verb for “to stay” is baqaa in the maaDii (past) and yabqaa in the
muDaari’ (present). To put a fi’l (fee-ehl; verb) in the mustaqbal (moos-tak-
bal; future), all you do is add the prefix sa- to the fi’l in the muDaari’. For
example, to communicate “I will stay for a period of one week,” you say 
sa-’abqaa li muddat ‘usbuu’ (sah-ab-kah lee moo-dat oos-booh).

Subjecting you to subjunctive verbs
yuriidu (yoo-ree-doo) is a special kind of verb — called subjunctive — that
means “want to.” Other verbs that fall into this category include yajibu (yah-
jee-boo; have to), yastaTii’u (yas-tah-tee-ooh; able to), and yuHibbu (yoo-hee-
boo; like). Unlike other types of verbs, these four verbs fall into the main
subjunctive category, which means that they’re conjugated in one tense only.
For example, here is the verb yuriidu conjugated in the subjunctive form:

In English, when you use a subjunctive verb to describe an action, you always
follow the verb with the preposition “to.” For example, you say “I want to
watch movies” or “I like to eat chocolate;” you would never say “I want watch
movies” or “I like eat chocolate.” Not only is it not proper English, but drop-
ping the “to” doesn’t really make that much sense. The same rule applies in
Arabic: When you use a subjunctive verb to describe an action, you always
add the preposition “to,” which is ‘an (ann) in Arabic.
To illustrate the subjunctive verbs in action, here are some examples:
 ‘uHibbu ‘an adhhaba ‘ilaa al-maktaba. (oo-hee-boo ann az-hah-bah ee-
lah al-mak-tah-bah; I like to go to the library.)
 ‘astaTii’u ‘an ‘af’ala al-waajib li-ghadan. (as-tah-tee-oo ann af-ah-lah al-
wah-jeeb lee-gah-dan; I’m able to do the homework for tomorrow.)
 yajibu ‘an taqra’a al-kitaab. (yah-jee-boo ann tak-rah al-kee-tab; You must
read the book.)
However, unlike in English where the auxiliary verb — the verb after the main
verbs “have to,” “like to,” “able to,” and “want to” — remains the same, the
auxiliary verb in Arabic changes and becomes a subjunctive verb. For all
intents and purposes, the subjunctive verb in this case is any verb that fol-
lows the preposition ‘an after one of the four main verbs. So when you use
one of the four main verbs above followed by ‘an and an auxiliary verb, you
must conjugate the auxiliary verb in the subjunctive form.
The subjunctive verb form is similar to the muDaari’ verb tense, except that
the verb endings are significantly different. For example, the muDaari’ form
of the verb kataba (kah-tah-bah; wrote) is yaktubu (yak-too-boo; to write). The
subjunctive form of yaktubu is yaktuba (yak-too-bah), with the Damma
changed to a fatHa. So if you wanted to say “I like to write,” you say ‘uHibbu
‘an ‘aktuba and not ‘uHibbiu ‘an aktubu.
231
Chapter 13: Staying at a Hotel

To get a better sense of the subjunctive, here is the verb “to write” in the sub-
junctive form:
Form
Pronunciation
Translation
‘anaa ‘aktuba
ah-nah ak-too-bah
I write
‘anta taktuba
ahn-tah tak-too-bah

‘anti taktubii

You write (FS)
huwa yaktuba
hoo-wah yak-too-bah
He writes
hiya taktuba
hee-yah tak-too-bah
She writes
naHnu naktuba
nah-noo nak-too-bah
We write
‘antum taktubuu
ahn-toom tak-too-boo
You write (MP)
‘antunna taktubna
ahn-too-nah tak-toob-nah
You write (FP)
hum yaktubuu
hoom yak-too-boo
They write (MP)
hunna yaktubna
hoo-nah yak-toob-nah
They write (FP)
antumaa taktubaa
ahn-too-mah tak-too-bah
You write (dual/MP/FP)
humaa yaktubaa
hoo-mah yak-too-bah
They write (dual/MP)
humaa taktubaa
hoo-mah tak-too-bah
They write (dual/FP)
Notice that whereas most of the endings in the subjunctive form change, a
few remain the same. These are the personal pronouns whose endings
remain the same in both the subjunctive and the muDaari’ environments —
‘antunna and hunna. Also, although a majority of the endings change vowels,
a few have endings that change completely: ‘anti, ‘antum, hum, ‘antumaa,
humaa (M), and humaa (F). In these endings, you actually drop the suffix. For
example, ‘antum taktubuuna becomes ‘antum taktubuu.
Whenever you use an auxiliary verb, make sure you use the subjunctive form
of that verb!
Checking In to the Hotel
When you arrive at your funduq after a long safar, probably the last thing on
your mind is going through the formalities of checking in. You probably just
want to go up to your ghurfa, jump on the sariir, and relax for a little while!
To help relieve the annoyance of check-in time, this section covers all the
necessary words and phrases to help you check in to your room as smoothly
as possible.

If you already have a Hajzu, ask the muwaDHaf al-‘istiqbaal (moo-wah-daf 
al-ees-teek-bal; desk clerk) for more ma’luumaat (mah-loo-mat; information)
regarding your ghurfa. If you don’t have a Hajzu, you can inquire about room
mawjooda (maw-joo-dah; availability) at the front desk.
Here are some important terms you may need during check-in:
 miftaH (meef-tah; key)
 miftaH al-ghurfa (meef-tah al-goor-fah; room key)
 ‘amti’a (am-tee-ah; luggage)
 shanTa (shan-tah; suitcase)
 miHfaDHa (meeh-fah-dah; briefcase)
 Tabiq (tah-beek; floor)
 miS’ad (mees-ad; elevator)
 ‘istiqbaal (ees-teek-bal; reception)
 maktab al-‘istiqbaal (mak-tab al-ees-teek-bal; reception desk)
 muwaDHaf al-‘istiqbaal (moo-wah-daf al-ees-teek-bal; desk clerk) (M)
 muwaDHafa al-‘istiqbaal (moo-wah-dah-fah al-ees-teek-bal; desk clerk) (F)
 bawwaab (bah-wab; concierge) (M)
 bawwaaba (bah-wah-bah; concierge) (F)
 maDmuun (mad-moon; included)
When interacting with the funduq staff, the following key phrases are likely
to come in handy:
 hal al-fuTuur maDmuun ma’a al-ghurfa? (hal al-foo-toor mad-moon mah-
ah al-goor-fah; Is breakfast included with the room?)
 mataa yabda’u al-fuTuur? (mah-tah yab-dah-oo al-foo-toor; When does
breakfast begin?)
 mataa yantahii al-fuTuur? (mah-tah yan-tah-hee al-foo-toor; When does
breakfast end?)
 hal hunaaka khabaran lii? (hal hoo-nah-kah kah-bah-ran lee; Are there
any messages for me?)
 ‘uriidu nahaad bi shakel mukaalama ma’a as-saa’a as-saabi’a. (oo-ree-
doo nah-had bee shah-kel moo-kah-lah-mah mah-ah ah-sah-ah ah-sah-bee-
ah; I would like a wake-up call at 7:00.)
 hal ‘indakum mushrifat al-ghurfa? (hal een-dah-koom moosh-ree-fat al-
goor-fah; Do you have room service?)

Checking Out of the Hotel
After your nice stay at the funduq, it’s time for waqt al-khuruuj (wah-ket al-
koo-rooj; checkout). Ask the maktab al-‘istiqbaal for the exact waqt al-khu-
ruuj; most hotels have a specific waqt al-khuruuj, such as noon, and if you
go over that time by only a few minutes, some hotels will charge you for a
whole extra night! It’s your responsibility to know the exact waqt al-khuruuj
and to be out of your room by then.
Before you leave the funduq, make sure you get all your ‘amti’a from your
ghurfa, and take care of the faatuura (fah-too-rah; bill). Some common extra
charges to watch out for include:
 faatuura al-haatif (fah-too-rah al-hah-teef; telephone bill)
 faatuura at-tilfaaz (fah-too-rah ah-teel-faz; TV pay-per-view bill)
 faatuura aT-Ta’aam (fah-too-rah ah-tah-am; food bill)
235
Chapter 13: Staying at a Hotel

When you pay the faatuura, it’s a good idea to get a ‘iiSaala (eeh-sah-lah;
receipt) in case you have a problem with the bill later on or can be reim-
bursed for your travel costs.

Getting from Here to There:
Transportation
In This Chapter

hen it comes to getting around the block, the city, or the world, you
have a lot of different modes of naql (nah-kel; transportation) to
choose from. And making the right choice for you is extremely important,
particularly if you’re traveling in a foreign country. Modes of transportation
differ from region to region and country to country, so it’s important you are
aware of subtle differences between the transportation methods you’re used
to and those you discover when you’re traveling abroad. 
In this chapter, I tell you, in Arabic, not only how to use all major transporta-
tion methods but also how to navigate a Middle Eastern city using these
modes of transport.
Traveling by Plane
One of the most common methods of naql is flying in a Taa’ira (tah-ee-rah;
airplane). The Taa’ira is probably the best method of naql to help you get to
a distant location in the least amount of time. Chances are if you’re in North
America or Europe and want to go to the Middle East, you’ll take a Taa’ira.
Making reservations
The first step in air travel is making a Hajzu (haj-zoo; reservation) and buying
a biTaaqat as-safar (bee-tah-kat ah-sah-far; plane ticket).You may purchase
your biTaaqat as-safar the traditional way, by simply visiting your wakiil

safariyaat (wah-keel sah-fah-ree-yat; travel agent). However, in this technologi-
cal age, more and more people choose to bypass the wakiil safariyaat in
favor of online travel agents. Even though you get more personalized service
from a wakiil safariyaat, you can probably get better deals by ordering your
plane tickets online. If you’re not sure where you want to go, the wakiil
safariyaat may be able to suggest destinations to suit your specific traveling
needs. But if you know exactly where you want to go, using an online travel
agent is probably more appropriate.
One of the potential pitfalls of going through online travel agents — particularly
if you use a specialized broker that focuses on specific global destinations,
such as the Middle East — is making sure that the online site is reputable. In
order to not get fooled, I recommend you use one of the more established
online travel agents, such as Expedia.com or Travelocity.com.

Getting some legwork out 
of the verb “to travel”
If there’s one verb you need to be familiar with relating to travel, it’s the verb
saafara (sah-fah-rah), which conveniently means “to travel.” Even though saa-
fara has four consonants instead of the usual three, it’s nevertheless consid-
ered to be a regular verb because the fourth consonant, the ‘alif, is actually a
consonant that acts as a long vowel elongating the siin. (For more on regular
verbs, flip to Chapter 2.) So saafara is conjugated in the maaDii (past) and
the muDaari’ (present) the same way as most other regular verbs. Here is the
verb saafara in the maaDii form:

Registering at the airport
With a biTaaqat as-safar, you’re ready to head off to the maTaar (mah-tar; air-
port) and board the Taa’ira. But before you actually get on the Taa’ira, you
need to take care of a few logistical things. First, you must present your jawaaz
as-safar (jah-waz ah-sah-far; passport) and your biTaaqat as-safar at the airport
tasjiil (tass-jeel; registration) desk, which is located in the maHaTTat al-
khuTuut al-jawwiya (mah-hah-tah al-koo-toot al-jah-wee-yah; airport terminal).
Second, you must also answer some ‘as’ila (ass-ee-lah; questions) about your
safar and your ‘amti’a (am-tee-ah; luggage).

Boarding the plane
So you’re ready to board the Taa’ira! After you check your ‘amti’a and pre-
sent your biTaaqat as-safar and your jawaaz as-safar to the airline attendant,
be sure to follow all ta’liimaat (tah-lee-mat; instructions) very carefully. Stay
in the Saff (saf; line) with your fellow rukkaab (roo-kab; passengers), and
follow any requests made by airport officials.

A brief departure on the verb “to arrive”
A helpful verb to know when you’re traveling is waSala (wah-sah-lah; to
arrive). (You can also use the verb waSala to express “to arrive,” “to land,” or
“to come.”) Even though waSala has three consonants and therefore should
fall into the mold of regular verb forms, it’s nevertheless classified as an irreg-
ular verb. It’s irregular because it includes the consonant waaw; verbs with
waaw are classified as irregular because their muDaari’ forms are radically
different than the regular muDaari’ verb forms. As a result, whereas the
maaDii form of waSala follows a regular pattern, the muDaari’ does not.
Here’s the verb waSala conjugated in the maaDii:

Going through immigration and customs
When your Taa’ira lands and you arrive at your chosen destination, it’s time
to deal with the hijra (heej-rah; immigration) and diwaana (dee-wah-nah; cus-
toms) officials. In recent years, airports have established more stringent
requirements on musaafiruun (travelers), so be prepared to answer a
number of ‘as’ila regarding the details and purpose of your safar. Here are
some common questions a hijra or diwaana official may ask you:
 maa ‘ismuk? (mah ees-mook; What’s your name?)
 kam ‘umruk? (kam um-rook; How old are you?)
 ‘ayna taskun? (eh-yeh-nah tass-koon; Where do you live?)
 maa hiya mihnatuk? (mah meeh-nah-took; What do you do?)
 kam muddat safaruk? (kam moo-dah sah-fah-rook; How long is your trip?)
 maa hadaf safaruk? (mah hah-daf sah-fah-rook; What’s the purpose of
your trip?)
 ‘ayna sataskun li muddat as-safar? (eh-yeh-nah sah-tass-koon lee moo-dat
ah-sah-far; Where will you be staying during the trip?)
 hal tusaafir biwaHdik? (hal too-sah-feer bee-wah-deek; Are you traveling
alone?)
Provide clear and accurate answers to these questions. Providing false state-
ments to an official from hijra or diwaana is a serious offense, so make sure
you’re truthful throughout the questioning.
If you’re visiting a Muslim country, check with your travel agent or consular
official about restrictions certain countries may have regarding bringing 
particular items into the country. For example, if you’re traveling to Saudi
Arabia, you can’t bring alcohol with you into the country; and if you’re a
woman, you may have to wear specific clothing, such as the Hijaab (hee-jab;
veil) in order to comply with local religious laws. You want to be certain you
are aware of all the rules and laws before you face someone from hijra or
diwaana.

Getting through the hijra post puts you one step closer to leaving the maTaar
and discovering the wonders of the exotic country you’re visiting! After your
interview with the hijra, you may proceed to pick up your ‘amti’a. You may

Chapter 14: Getting from Here to There: Transportation

use the help of a Hammaal (hah-mal; baggage handler/porter), or you may
simply use an ‘ariiba (ah-ree-bah; cart) to haul your own luggage.
Before you actually leave the maTaar, you must go through diwaana (cus-
toms). Use the following phrases when speaking with diwaana officials:
 laa shay’ li al-‘i’laan. (lah shay lee al-eeh-lan; Nothing to declare.)
 ‘indii shay’ li al-‘i’laan. (een-dee shay lee al-eeh-lan; I have something to
declare.)
Check with your travel agent, consular officer, or embassy official to find out
about any products or restrictions imposed by countries you’re traveling to.
You should know what’s prohibited from entering or leaving a specific coun-
try because the consequences of not knowing may be quite high. In addition,
certain countries have limits on the amount of cash you can bring in and take
out. Knowing these currency restrictions is equally important.

Hailing a taxi
If you’re in a large or medium-sized city and need to get from one location to
another quickly and relatively inexpensively, then hailing a taxi is probably
the best option for you. When hailing a cab in a foreign country, keep the fol-
lowing advice in mind:
 Make sure that the taxi you hail is fully licensed and authorized by
the local agencies to operate as a taxi. A number of companies operate
illegal taxis and take advantage of unsuspecting tourists — make sure
you’re not one of them! Usually, most legitimate taxi operators have
licensing information on display somewhere inside the cab or even on
the car’s exterior.
 Be aware that most taxis that run to and from the airport charge a flat
rate. Inquire about the flat rate before you get into the taxi.
 If you’re in the city, make sure the taxi saa’iq (sah-eek; driver) turns
on the Hasuub (hah-soob; meter). A common occurrence is that a
driver forgets (either accidentally or intentionally) to turn on the meter
and ends up charging you, the passenger, an exorbitant amount of
money for a short ride.
In most Arab and Middle Eastern countries, tipping the saa’iq is not required.
However, I’m sure the saa’iq won’t argue if you decide to give him a little tip!

Taking a bus
The Haafila (bus) is a convenient mode of transportation whether you’re
traveling across town or across the country. If you’re in a city and traveling
within city limits, taking the bus is a good option because it usually costs less
255
Chapter 14: Getting from Here to There: Transportation

than a taxi. If you’re traveling across the country, not only is taking a bus an
economical option, but you also get to enjoy the beautiful scenery up close
and personal!
Most Haafilaat (buses) accept prepaid biTaaqaat (tickets). If you take the
Haafila frequently, refill your biTaaqa regularly. Otherwise, if you only take 
a bus occasionally, you’ll be glad to know that most Haafilaat also accept
fuluus (foo-loos; cash) as long as it’s small bills. Here are some common
terms you may need or encounter if you decide to take a Haafila:
 biTaaqat al-Haafila (bee-tah-kat al-hah-fee-lah; bus ticket)
 maHaTTat al-Haafila (mah-hah-tat al-hah-fee-lah; bus station/bus stop)
 saa’iq al-Haafila (sah-eek al-hah-fee-lah; bus driver)
 tawqiit al-Haafila (taw-keet al-hah-fee-lah; bus schedule)
If you want to say “every” as in “every day” or “every hour,” all you do is add
the work kul (kool; every) before the noun that describes the time you’re
referring to. For example:
 kul al-yawm (kool al-yawm; every day)
 kul saa’a (kool sah-ah; every hour)
 kul niSf saa’a (kool nee-sef sah-ah; every half hour)
 kul rubu’ saa’a (kool roo-booh sah-ah; every fifteen minutes)

Boarding a train
The qiTaar (train) is a popular alternative if you’re looking for transportation
that’s convenient, fast, affordable, and allows you to do a little sightseeing
while you’re on the go. When you board the qiTaar, be ready to provide your
biTaaqa to the qiTaar attendant. Although boarding most qiTaar doesn’t
require a biTaaqa shakhSiyya (bee-tah-kah shak-see-yah; personal ID card),
you should be ready to present one if an attendant asks you for it.

Planning a Trip
In This Chapter
 Deciding where and when to go
 Packing your bags
 Dealing with travel documents
 Consulting a travel agent
I
don’t know about you, but I simply love traveling. I enjoy visiting exotic
locations around the world, meeting new people from different back-
grounds, and discovering new cultures. This chapter tells you everything
you need to know about planning, organizing, and going on a riHla (reeh-lah;
trip) — in Arabic, of course.
Choosing Your Destination
When you decide to take a trip, ‘ayna (ay-nah; where) to go is probably the
biggest decision you face. For ‘afkaar (af-kar; ideas) on a possible travel
wujha (wooj-hah; destination), you may want to consult a wakiil safariyaat
(wah-keel sah-fah-ree-yat; travel agent). Table 15-1 lists the Arabic names of
some popular travel destinations you can choose from.

Picking the Right Time for Your Trip
A major part of travel planning is timing. When you have an idea of what you
want to do or where you want to go, you need to consider the most appropri-
ate time to take the trip. An obvious example is deciding to go skiing and
making sure your mountain destination will have snow when you’re there.
However, things can get trickier if you’re traveling to a Middle Eastern or
Islamic country; during some months of the year, such as the holy month of
Ramadan, traveling to these countries probably isn’t a good idea because the
time is sacred to Muslims.
The months of the year
Look at the taqwiim (tak-weem; calendar) and choose the shahr (shah-her;
month) most suitable not only to your travel plans but also to the dawla
(daw-lah; country) you’re visiting. Table 15-1 identifies the months in Arabic.

Chapter 15: Planning a Trip

There are in fact two methods of transcribing months in Arabic. The one in
Table 15-2 is based on the Gregorian calendar, which is widely used in the
West. The second way of identifying months is based on the Islamic lunar
system. Flip to Chapter 4 to see the months listed according to the Islamic
calendar.
For travel purposes, the Gregorian calendar convention is most widely used,
so if you’re making a reservation, you can use the months listed in Table 15-2
to communicate the time of your riHla.
Dates and ordinal numbers
After you narrow down the shahr in which you want to take your riHla, you
must specify the dates of your riHla by using numbers. Arabic numbers fall
into two categories: cardinals and ordinals. Cardinals are regular counting
numbers, like “one,” “two,” or “three;” ordinals are the adjective forms of
numbers, like “first,” “second,” and “third.” Arabic ordinals differ from cardi-
nals in that every ordinal number has both a masculine and feminine form.
Because ordinals are treated as adjectives, they must be in gender agreement
with their corresponding nouns.
When you specify a date, you say “December fifth” or “January eighth.”
Because shahr is a masculine noun (the terms for months are masculine), you
must use masculine ordinals to identify specific dates. For example, you say
disambar al-khaamis (dee-sam-bar al-kah-mees; December fifth) or yanaayir
ath-thaamin (yah-nah-yeer ah-thah-meen; January eighth). In addition, because
the ordinal acts as a possessive adjective, you must include the possessive
prefix al-. For more on cardinals and ordinals, flip to Chapter 4. For a compre-
hensive list of ordinals, flip to Chapter 12.

Tackling Packing
Packing the right items for your riHla is a crucial step toward enjoying your
travel experience. First, you must gather the ‘amti’a (am-tee-ah; luggage) you
need. Here are some possibilities:
 shanTa (shan-tah; suitcase)
 shanTaat (shan-tat; suitcases)
 miHfaDHa (meeh-fah-dah; briefcase)
 miHfaDHaat (meeh-fah-dat; briefcases)
 kiis (kees; bag)
 ‘akyaas (ak-yas; bags)
 kiis al-Hammamm (kees al-hah-mam; toiletry bag)
 ‘akyaas al-Hammaam (ak-yas al-hah-mam; toiletry bags)
 Haqiiba (hah-kee-bah; small bag)
 Haqaa’ib (hah-kah-eeb; small bags)
With your ‘amti’a selected, it’s time to choose what to put in the ‘amti’a. Here
are some essential items you should carry with you regardless of your wujha:
 malaabis (mah-lah-bees; clothes)
 ‘aqmisa (ak-mee-sah; shirts)
 sirwaal (seer-wal; pants)
 mi’Taf (meeh-taf; coat)
 ‘aHdiya (ah-dee-yah; shoes)
 ‘aHzima (ah-zee-mah; belts)
 jawaarib (jah-wah-reeb; socks)
 naDHaraat (nah-zah-rat; glasses)
 naDHaraat ash-shams (nah-zah-rat ah-shah-mes; sunglasses)
 qubba’a (koo-bah-ah; hat)
In addition to clothing and accessories, you also need grooming items. Here
are some toiletries you may pack for your riHla:
 shawkat al-‘asnaan (shaw-kat al-ass-nan; toothbrush)
 ma’juun al-‘asnaan (mah-joon al-ass-nan; toothpaste)
 mushT (moo-shet; comb)
273
Chapter 15: Planning a Trip

 ghasuul as-sha’r (gah-sool ah-shah-er; shampoo)
 Saabuun (sah-boon; soap)
 muziil ar-rawaa’iH (moo-zeel ah-rah-wah-eeh; deodorant)
 fuuTa (foo-tah; towel)
 ‘aalat al-Hilaaqa (ah-lat al-hee-lah-kah; shaving razor)
 ma’juun al-Hilaaqa (mah-joon al-hee-lah-kah; shaving cream)
Preparing Your Travel Documents
The logistics of travel can get pretty complicated, especially when you’re trav-
eling internationally. In recent years, travel restrictions have grown more strin-
gent due to growing concern over security. In this section, you can find all the
key terms you need to know in order to gather the appropriate wathaa’iq as-
safar (wah-thah-eek ah-sah-far; travel documents) to make your riHla go as
smoothly as possible.
Before you leave on a riHla, you need to have at least one biTaaqa shakhsiyya
(bee-tah-kah shak-see-yah; personal identification card); to be safe, you should
probably have two or more. In case you need further confirmation of your iden-
tity, carrying three forms of identification is ideal. Here are some biTaaqaat
shaksiyya (bee-tah-kat shak-see-yah; personal identification cards) you could
carry with you:
 biTaaqat as-saa’iq (bee-tah-kat ah-sah-eek; driver’s license)
 biTaaqa min al-Hukuuma (bee-tah-kah meen al-hoo-koo-mah; govern-
ment-issued ID)
 biTaaqa min al-jaysh (bee-tah-kah meen al-jah-yesh; military-issued ID)
 jawaaz as-safar (jah-waz ah-sah-far; passport)
 biTaaqat al-‘amal (bee-tah-kat al-ah-mal; work permit)
The word biTaaqa (bee-tah-kah) literally means “card.” However, its meaning
may change depending on the context of the phrase in which it’s used. For
instance, in the terms just listed, the word, biTaaqa means “license” as well
as “permit.”
In addition to personal identification documents, if you’re traveling overseas,
many countries require that you also have a ta’shiira (tah-shee-rah; visa)
stamped on your jawaaz as-safar. Every dawla (daw-lah; country) has different
274
Part III: Arabic on the Go

procedures and requirements for obtaining ta’shiiraat (tah-shee-rat; visas), so
it’s your responsibility to find out whether the dawla you’re planning to visit
requires a ta’shiira and, if so, how to go about obtaining one. The categories of
ta’shiiraat include:

arrange to speak with a muwDHaf al-qunSulliiyya (moo-wah-daf al-kon-soh-

Chapter 15: Planning a Trip
What’s the difference between 
an embassy and a consulate?
The consulate and the embassy are foreign gov-
ernment outposts located in a host or target
country. For example, the United States has both
embassies and consulates in many countries
around the world. A consulate is generally
located in a busy tourist destination, and its offi-
cials and employees take care of minor diplo-
matic tasks such as issuing visas and
sponsoring educational seminars. An embassy
is usually located in a nation’s capital and has a
more policy-oriented approach. It’s slightly less
bureaucratic than a consulate, and it usually
represents its country’s official diplomatic
stance in the host country.
A consulate is headed by a consul, the person in
charge of issuing visas and promoting better
relations with the people of a host country; in
contrast, an embassy is run by an ambassador
whose general responsibility is to make sure
that diplomatic ties — on a government-to-
government basis — remain strong and healthy.
If you’re in a foreign country and need to ask a
quick bureaucratic question (such as, “How can
I extend my visa?”), you should head to the con-
sulate. However, if something serious happens
(you’re put in jail, for instance), then contacting
the embassy is more appropriate.
If you’re an American citizen traveling abroad,
to find answers to any questions you have
regarding preparing your wathaa’iq as-safar
prior to your riHla, visit the State Department’s
Bureau of Consular Affairs Web site at
travel.state.gov.

Using a Travel Agency
Although you can turn to a number of different sources for ma’luumaat on
organizing your riHla, few can provide you with the degree of top-notch
service and personal attention that a wakiil as-safariyaat (wah-keel ah-sah-
fah-ree-yat; travel agent) can provide.
A good wakiil as-safariyaat can recommend the most suitable places for
your riHla and provide you with logistical information and assistance to
make your riHla a success. A wakiil as-safariyaat can provide you with
ma’luumaat concerning:
 fanaadiq (fah-nah-deek; hotels)
 ‘amwaal an-naql (am-wal ah-nah-kel; modes of transportation)
 Taa’iraat (tah-ee-rat; airplanes)
 Sayyaaraat (sah-yah-rat; cars)
 Haafilaat (hah-fee-lat; buses)
 ‘ijaazaat (ee-jah-zat; plans)
 Hujuuzaat (hoo-joo-zat; reservations)
 tanziilaat (tan-zee-lat; discounts)
 tanziilaat al-majmoo’a (tan-zee-lat al-maj-moo-ah; group discounts)
For example, the wakiil as-safariyaat can tell you about tanziilaat that you’re
eligible for if you’re traveling in a majmoo’a (maj-moo-ah; group) or special
rates you can obtain on transportation. 
Many wakiil as-safariyaat provide special rates and packages that include
not only airfare but also hotel Hujuuzaat. Here are some travel packages you
should ask about:
 layla wa yawmayn (lay-lah wah yaw-mayn; one night and two days)
 laylatayn wa thalaath ‘ayyaam (lay-lah-tayn wah thah-lath ah-yam; two
nights and three days)
 sittat layla wa sab’at ‘ayyaam (see-tat lay-lah wah sab-at ah-yam; six
nights and seven days)
278
Part III: Arabic on the Go

When reviewing information from your wakiil as-safariyaat, keep a lookout
for the following deals:
 al-funduq maDmuun. (al-foon-dook mad-moon; Hotel is included.)
 ziyaara fii al-madiina maDmuuna. (zee-yah-rah fee al-mah-dee-nah mad-

 al-fuTuur wa al-ghidaa’ maDmuuniin. (al-foo-toor wah al-gee-dah mad-

 al-funduq wa aT-Taa’ira maDmuuniin. (al-foon-dook wah ah-tah-ee-rah

Handling an Emergency

N
o one can deny the power of positive thinking. However, there are
times when negative situations arise, and you must be able to rise
to the occasion and help not only yourself but those around you if neces-
sary. So even though remaining positive is always a good thing, you should
also know how to handle negative situations if you find yourself faced with
them.
Handling an emergency in your native tongue can be quite hard to begin
with, given the adrenaline rush and possible feelings of panic, so dealing
with a situation in a foreign language such as Arabic may seem daunting.
But don’t panic! In this chapter, I give you the right words, phrases, and
procedures to help you overcome any emergency situation — whether
medical, legal, or political — just like a native speaker.
Shouting Out for Help
When you’re witnessing or experiencing an emergency such as a theft, a fire,
or even someone having a heart attack, your first instinct is to start yelling
and shouting. That’s the right instinct. But you also need to be able to com-
municate coherently so that you can get musaa’ada (moo-sah-ah-dah; help).
This section tells you which words to use to express your sense of emergency
verbally in order to get the right kind of musaa’ada.

Essentially, Arabic has two words that mean “help”: musaa’ada (moo-sah-ah-
dah) and mu’aawana (moo-ah-wah-nah). Both words are used interchange-
ably to ask for help in an emergency. You can attract help by shouting
musaa’ada or mu’aawana once, but you attract more attention when you
shout the words consecutively:
 musaa’ada musaa’ada! (moo-sah-ah-dah moo-sah-ah-dah; Help help!)
 mu’aawana mu’aawana! (moo-ah-wah-nah moo-ah-wah-nah; Help help!)
Arabic actually has a third word that means “help”: najda (nah-jeh-dah). You
can use najda to call for help, but be aware that screaming najda means that
someone is in a severe, extremely dangerous, life-and-death situation. (If
there were degrees to words for “help” — where level 3 is high and level 5 is
extreme — musaa’ada and mu’aawana would be level 3s and najda would be
a level 5.)
It may be difficult to understand this classification of “help” because when
you’re in an emergency, you tend not to think about your situation on a scale
of seriousness. Your reaction is usually, “I’m in trouble, and I need help now.”
The Arabic vocabulary for emergencies is structured in such a way as to
differentiate between life-and-death emergencies and non–life-and-death
situations.
The basic rule for expressing that you need help is that if you’re involved in
a life-and-death situation, you should scream out najda. Think of najda as
the code red of distress signals, only to be used if your life or the life of
others is in danger. For example, screaming najda isn’t appropriate if you
sprain your ankle while playing soccer. However, if you’re witnessing or
experiencing a drowning, a heart attack, or a suicide attempt, you should
scream najda like this:
an-najda an-najda! (ahn-nah-jeh-dah ahn-nah-jeh-dah; Help help!)
Here are some other important words and phrases to help you cope with an
emergency:
 saa’iduunii! (sah-ee-doo-nee; Help me!)
 ‘aawinuunii! (ah-wee-noo-nee; Help me!)
 shurTa! (shoo-reh-tah; Police!)
 ‘uriidu Tabiib! (oo-ree-doo tah-beeb; I need a doctor!)
 liSS! (lehs; Thief!)
 naar! (nahr; Fire!)
Part III: Arabic on the Go
282

A little help with the verb “to help”
The word musaa’ada is derived from the verb saa’ada (sah-ah-dah), which
means “to help.” Although screaming musaa’ada is an important first step to
attract attention to an emergency, you also need to be able to coherently
formulate a sentence in order to get the right kind of help. Use the form
saa’ada to conjugate the verb “to help” in the maaDii (mah-dee; past tense)
and yusaa’idu (yoo-sah-ee-doo) to conjugate it in the muDaari’ (moo-dah-reeh;
present tense). (Check out Chapter 2 for a quick reminder of the maaDii and
muDaari’ forms.)
Here’s the verb saa’ada conjugated in the maaDii form:

Use the form yusaa’idu to conjugate “to help” in the muDaari’. Recall that
the present tense in Arabic describes both a habitual action, such as “I help,”
and an ongoing action, such as “I am helping.”

humaa tusaa’idaani
hoo-mah too-sah-ee-dah-nee

Although Arabic has more than one word for “help,” only musaa’ada is the
most conjugated verb form. mu’aawana may also be conjugated using the
form ‘aawana in the maaDii and yu’aawinu in the muDaari’, but it’s more of
an archaic and arcane verb that isn’t widely used in everyday Arabic.
Because najda is more of a code word for distress, it doesn’t have a verb
equivalent form.
Lending a hand
Being in an emergency doesn’t always mean that you’re the one who needs
help. You may be faced with a situation where you’re actually the person
who’s in a position to offer help. In this case, you need to know words and
phrases of an altogether different nature. The words and phrases in this sec-
tion help you better respond to a situation in which you’re the helper and not
the one being helped.
The first thing you do in such a situation is ask questions to assess the
damage and determine what course of action to take:
 maadhaa waqa’a? (mah-zah wah-kah-ah; What happened?)
 hal kul shay’ bikhayr? (hal kool shah-yeh bee-kayr; Is everything alright?)
Part III: Arabic on the Go
284

 hal turiidu musaa’ada? (hal too-ree-doo moo-sah-ah-dah; Do you need
help?)
 ‘ay naw’ min musaa’ada turiidu? (ay nah-weh meen moo-sah-ah-dah too-
ree-doo; What kind of help do you need?)
 hal yajibu ‘an tadhhab ‘ilaa al-mustashfaa? (hal yah-jee-boo ann taz-hab
ee-laa al-moos-tash-fah; Do you need to go to the hospital?)
 hal turiidu Tabiib? (hal too-ree-doo tah-beeb; Do you need a doctor?)
If you’re in a situation in which injuries are serious and the person appears to
be disoriented, then you must take further steps, such as contacting the
shurTa (shoo-reh-tah; police) or other first responders.
If you’re ever in a situation where you need to call the police, you may say
the following on the phone: ‘aHtaaju bi musaa’ada fawran (ah-tah-joo bee
moo-sah-ah-dah faw-ran; I need help right away). 
Talkin’ the Talk
Lamia is walking down the street when, all of a sudden, the
woman walking in front of her falls on the ground. Lamia

Getting Medical Help
If you’re like me, you may find that even though going to the doctor’s office is
necessary and important, it isn’t always the most fun part of your day. But
visiting the doctor is essential for each and every one of us. This section
introduces you to important medical terms to help you interact effectively
with medical staff.
Locating the appropriate doctor
In case of a medical urgency, your first stop should be the mustashfaa
(moos-tash-fah; hospital) to see a Tabiib (tah-beeb; doctor). If you simply
need a checkup, go see a Tabiib ‘aam (tah-beeb ahm; general doctor). If your
needs are more specific, look for one of these specialist doctors:
 Tabiib ‘asnaan (tah-beeb ahs-nan; dentist)
 Tabiib ‘aynayn (tah-beeb ah-yeh-nayn; ophthalmologist)
 Tabiib rijl (tah-beeb ree-jel; orthopedist)
 Tabiib ‘aTfaal (tah-beeb aht-fal; pediatrician)
Talking about your body
Locating the right doctor is only the first step toward getting treatment. In
order to interact with the Tabiib, you need to be able to identify your differ-
ent body parts in Arabic, explaining which parts hurt and which are fine.
Table 16-1 lists all your major body parts.

Explaining your symptoms
The Tabiib can’t provide you with the proper treatment unless you communi-
cate the kind of pain you’re experiencing. How mariiD (mah-reed; sick) do
you feel? Do you have a SuDaa’ (soo-dah; headache)? Or perhaps a Haraara
(hah-rah-rah; fever)? Table 16-2 lists common symptoms.

When you go to the Tabiib, he or she may ask you, maadha yu’limuka?
(mah-zah yoo-lee-moo-kah; What hurts you?). The most common way to
respond to this question is to name the body part that hurts followed by
yu’limunii (yoo-lee-moo-nee; hurts me). So when the Tabiib asks maadha
yu’limuka?, you may say:
 ra’sii yu’limunii. (rah-see yoo-lee-moo-nee; My head hurts me.)
 ‘udhunayn tu’limunii. (oo-zoo-nay-nee too-lee-moo-nee; My ears hurt me.)
 Sadrii yu’limunii. (sah-der-ee yoo-lee-moo-nee; My chest hurts me.)
 diraa’ii yu’imunii. (dee-rah-ee yoo-lee-moo-nee; My arm hurts me.)
Getting treatment
After the Tabiib analyzes your symptoms, he or she is able to offer you 
‘ilaaj (ee-laj; treatment). Following the Tabiib’s orders is important for both
getting and remaining saliim (sah-leem; healthy), so pay attention. Here are
treatment-related words you may encounter:
 dawaa’ (dah-wah; medicine)
 SayDaliiyya (sah-yeh-dah-lee-yah; pharmacy)
 ‘iyaada (ee-yah-dah; clinic)

Chapter 16: Handling an Emergency

Acquiring Legal Help
Let’s hope it’s never the case, but you may have a run-in with the law and
need the services of a muHaamiiy (moo-hah-mee; lawyer). The muHaamiiy
has a good understanding of the qaanuun (kah-noon; law) and is in a position
to help you if you’re ever charged with committing a mujrima (mooj-ree-mah;
crime).
If you happen to be in a foreign country and need legal representation, the
best route is to contact your country’s qunSuliyya (koon-soo-lee-yah; con-
sulate) and ask to speak to the qunSul (koon-sool; consul). Because consular
officers have a very good understanding of the laws of their host countries,
you may be better off getting help directly from them rather than finding your
own muHaamiiy. Especially if it looks like you have to go to maHkama (mah-
kah-mah; court) and face a qaadiiy (kah-dee; judge), the help a qunSuliyya
can provide is invaluable.
You may also want to call your country’s sifaara (see-fah-rah; embassy) if
you’re in a really serious situation. Even if you’re unable to talk to the safiir
(sah-feer; ambassador) directly, your sifaara may take the appropriate steps
to provide you with assistance.

A
rabic is a language that needs to be constantly spoken, heard, and
practiced. Even many native speakers try to read an Arabic newspaper
every day or watch a majalla ‘ikhbaariya (mah-jah-lah eek-bah-ree-yah; news
broadcast) in order to maintain their level of fluency. So to get the best grasp
of the language, you should try to immerse yourself in an environment where
Arabic is the prevalent language. This chapter has recommendations on
some key ways to help you not only pick up Arabic but also maintain a good
degree of understanding of the language after you’re comfortable with it.
Watch Arabic Television
Since the late 1990s, the Arabic audiovisual landscape has experienced a seis-
mic shift. With the advent of satellite TV across the Arab world and the Middle
East, Arab TV stations have spread across the world. Besides the well-known
satellite news outlets al-jaziira (al-jah-zee-rah; the island) and al-’arabiyya
(al-ah-rah-bee-ya; the Arabic), there are a number of other TV stations you can
watch to help you fine-tune your accent and intonation. The news channels
offer valuable exposure to spoken Modern Standard Arabic, which is the
Arabic used in this book. Because this version’s more formal than others,
watching Arabic news channels will give you a better grasp of the grammatical
rules — and your Arabic will be greatly improved as a result.

Another option for Arabic TV is MBC (Middle East Broadcast Corporation),
which airs movies, soap operas, and talk shows that showcase some of the
local spoken dialects such as Lebanese and Egyptian. If you’re in the United
States, you can order Arabic channels from your local cable provider or satel-
lite TV operator; these channels have subtitles in English so you can follow
along. Believe it or not, watching TV is one of the best ways to pick up a lan-
guage. Personally, I didn’t start speaking English until I was 10 years old, and
one of the most effective tools that helped me grasp the language was watch-
ing sitcoms like The Simpsons.
Use the Dictionary
The qaamoos (kah-moos; dictionary) contains a wealth of information about
Arabic words, phrases, and expressions. Simply picking up the dictionary
once a day and memorizing a single word can have a huge effect on your
Arabic vocabulary. Once you reach fluency in reading and writing Arabic,
you’ll realize that vowels aren’t included in most of the Arabic texts you read,
such as newspapers, books, and magazines. At first, trying to read without
the vocalizations takes practice, but with the help of the qaamoos, you
should be able to overcome this hurdle.
If reading the qaamoos is simply too low-tech for your taste, go online and
find a word-a-day generating program that sends you an e-mail every morning
with a new Arabic word; its pronunciation, meaning, and origins; and the con-
text in which you use it. What a great way for you to build your vocabulary
without actually opening the qaamoos! The Web site www.ectaco.com offers
such a service. 
Read Arabic Newspapers
The Arabic SaHaafa (sah-hah-fah; press) is very vibrant and offers many dif-
ferent publications covering a wide array of perspectives. Newspapers across
the Arab world cater to all sorts of points-of-view, from the ultraliberal to the
ultra-conservative. Reading Arabic newspapers is a good way to not only
practice reading the language but also become more familiar with the issues
concerning the Arab world.
You can purchase Arabic newspapers at most major newsstands in major met-
ropolitan areas, such as New York City. Also, many Arabic newspapers now
have online editions that you can access anytime, from anywhere. For more
on Arabic newspapers and where to locate them, visit www.al-baab.com.

Surf the Internet
I believe that the Internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time — you
have practically all the world’s information at your fingertips! Plus, it’s an
amazing tool that can help you master Arabic quickly and efficiently. Simply
visit any search engine — such as Google or Yahoo! — type the search word
“Arabic,” and start surfing. Or you can browse media Web sites, such as
www.aljazeera.net or www.arabicworldnews.com. Most media sites have
a Links section where you generally find a list of other Web sites that are sim-
ilar in nature. Perusing these sites in Arabic should greatly improve your
reading comprehension.
Use a Language Tape or CD
If you’re a person who picks up a language by hearing it over and over, then
you can’t afford not to buy a few instructional Arabic CDs. Start by listening
to the CD that came with this book; you’ll find that the conversations are
extremely helpful in helping you identify the speed, intonation, and pronunci-
ation that makes you sound more like a native speaker. For more resources,
investigate Arabic libraries in your city that offer instructional tapes and CDs,
or check out your regular library to see what Arabic audio tools it offers —
you may be surprised at what’s available.
Listen to Arabic Music
Arabic music is one of the liveliest, most melodic, and fun types of music in
the world. Because Arabic music is so energetic and fun, you’ll pick up new
phrases and words without even realizing it! You can choose from a lot of
popular Arabic musicians, including:
 Sheb Khaled from Algeria, who plays Rai music. Rai music is the equiva-
lent of Arabic hip-hop. The singer freestyles over a musical beat or
rhythm. 
 Farid Al-atrache, a master of the ‘uud. The ‘uud is a musical instrument
that’s similar to the guitar; but unlike a regular guitar, it has a wide,
hollow body.
 Najat ‘atabou, a popular folk singer from Morocco.
Check out any of these artists online, or go to your local music store and
browse through the Middle East section for even more possiblities.

Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Pick Up Arabic Quickly

Make Arabic-Speaking Friends
It’s really hard to find a substitute for human contact and human interactions.
Making friends who are native or fluent Arabic speakers and carrying on con-
versations with them in Arabic dramatically improves your speaking and com-
prehension skills. After all, your friends are in a position to correct you gently
and help you use the right expressions, phrases, and sentences in the appro-
priate contexts. Part of the challenge of picking up a language, especially
one like Arabic, lies in the fact that you need to put your language skills —
especially vocabulary and expressions — in the right context. Speaking with
friends is the best way to do that!
Watch Arabic Movies
Watching Arabic movies can be a lot more fun than watching TV because you
aren’t interrupted by commercials and you generally have subtitles to follow.
Most local movie stores and libraries carry popular Arabic movies on DVD or
VHS tape, so you’re sure to find something that interests you. Just be sure to
get a movie with English subtitles so that you can follow along!
A movie that’s worth watching is the Arabic version of Lawrence of Arabia.
Another classic movie is The Messenger (ar-risaala). 
Eat at a Middle Eastern Restaurant
Almost every city in the world has at least one Middle Eastern maT’am (mat-
ham; restaurant), so let your fingers do the walking and find one in your area.
Eating at a Middle Eastern restaurant provides you with a safe, fun, and
engaging atmosphere in which to practice your language skills by interacting
with the waitstaff in Arabic. Order drinks, food, and ask questions about the
food preparation in Arabic, and you’ll be amazed at how much you’ll improve
your Arabic reading and comprehension skills. And the restaurant staff are
sure to be impressed with both your skill and interest in the language!
Sing Arabic Songs
Singing an ‘ughniiya (oog-nee-yah; song) is a fun, interactive, and effective
way to pick up Arabic. Arabic songs tend to be extremely melodic and soul-
ful, so not only will you enjoy singing an ‘ughniiya, but you’ll also encounter
new vocabulary and identify some of the intonations and beats that make
Arabic such a unique language.

Ten Things You Should Never Do
in an Arab Country
In This Chapter
 Following proper greeting etiquette
 Respecting places that are off-limits
 Displaying appropriate behavior during the holy month of Ramadan
 Being a good guest
C
ross-cultural dialogue isn’t only spoken; nonlanguage signs are equally
important in communicating and building bridges between cultures. By
definition, a culture has a different set of values, principles, and social customs
than other cultures. This chapter covers the unspoken rules to follow to help
you avoid making faux-pas with native Arabic speakers or peoples from Arab
countries.
Don’t Shake Hands with a Firm Grip
In the United States, Europe, and throughout most of the Western world,
people are encouraged to shake hands with a firm grip. Having a good, solid
grip conveys a healthy dose of confidence in the West. In the Middle East,
however, shaking hands with a tight or firm grip is considered impolite.
Sometimes, it may even be interpreted as an openly hostile act! The logic
behind this social custom is as follows: You use force and strength against
your enemies, so shaking someone’s hand with extreme force or strength
may be interpreted as considering that person an enemy. The best way
to shake hands if you’re traveling in the Arab world is to present a
friendly, not-too-firm grip — that way you’re sure not to make any
unnecessary foes!

Don’t Enter a Room Full of People
Without Saying “‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum”
As a general rule, you should get into the habit of saying ‘as-salaamu
‘alaykum (ah-sah-lah-moo ah-lay-koom) whenever you enter a room, regard-
less of whether the people in the room are acquaintances or strangers. The
phrase literally means “May peace be upon you” but is the equivalent of
saying “Hello” in English.
Many people believe this saying has special significance because of religious
and historical connotations. More than just a simple greeting, the phrase is
used to convey a sense of respect and camaraderie; it’s the equivalent of
saying “I come in peace.” Saying ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum signals to all that your
intentions are honorable and pure. Rather than direct this greeting at a single
person, ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum should be directed at everyone in the room.
After you say it, you will hear a reply in unison: wa ‘alaykum as-salaam (wah
ah-lay-koom ah-sah-lam; and upon you peace).
Don’t Start Eating Before Saying 
“bismi allah”
If you’re invited to eat at a friend’s house for dinner or lunch, or if you’re sit-
ting with co-workers at the cafeteria, make sure that you say bismi allah
(bees-mee ah-lah; In the name of Allah [God]) before you start eating. Arabs
and Muslims believe that before you eat, you should give thanks to God for
the food you’re about to put in your mouth. It doesn’t matter whether you’re
Muslim or non-Muslim; bismi allah is an important phrase to use. (You don’t
have to say bismi allah before every bite, just before you begin the meal.)
Keep in mind that this phrase isn’t used exclusively to bless food; you may
hear someone say bismi allah before drinking water, starting a car, getting on
a plane, and even before beginning to speak.
If You’re Not Muslim, Don’t Enter a
Mosque Without Explicit Authorization
For Muslims, the masjid (mas-jeed; mosque) is one of the holiest places
on earth. It’s where Muslims go to pray, both individually and communally,
Part IV: The Part of Tens
300

301
Chapter 18: Ten Things You Should Never Do in an Arab Country
and where most Muslims feel the closest bond to allah. Therefore, if you’re
non-Muslim, entering a mosque — any mosque — is strictly prohibited.
There are exceptions to this rigidly enforced rule, but they’re few and far
between. For example, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca, Morocco, has
a special section for non-Muslims who are interested in discovering the
beautiful architecture of the masjid. Visitors are allowed to walk through
parts of the masjid — excluding the main prayer room, which is reserved
for Muslims only — with a properly certified guide. Even in these exceptions,
however, strict rules must be followed, such as removing your shoes (see
the next section) and performing absolution before entering parts of the
masjid.
Don’t Enter a Mosque 
with Your Shoes On
Whereas non-Muslims are generally restricted from entering the masjid,
Muslims aren’t allowed to enter the masjid with their shoes on. Muslims
strongly believe the masjid is a holy place that must be treated with consider-
able respect and cleanliness. If you’re Muslim and want to go to the masjid for
prayer, it’s absolutely necessary you remove your Hidaa’ (hee-dah; shoes).
Similarly, if you’re non-Muslim but are granted permission to visit parts of the
masjid, you must remove your shoes as well.
Don’t Eat or Drink During Ramadan
The holy month of Ramadan is the most sacred time for Muslims around the
world. During this month, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset in an attempt
to cleanse themselves from the impurities of the world. The fasting is usually
very strict — no food, no drink (including water), and no smoking. If you’re
non-Muslim and happen to visit an Islamic country during the month of
Ramadan, it’s really important that you don’t eat or drink while the rest of the
population is fasting. If you want to eat, you may do so within the confines of
your own lodging. But under no circumstances should you go out and have a
cigarette on the street corner while Ramadan is taking place. However, after
sunset, when the fast is over and people are allowed to eat, smoke, and drink
(nonalcoholic beverages), feel free to partake in these activities with every-
one else.

Don’t Drink Alcohol During Ramadan
Although you may drink water, soda, or juice in public after the breaking of the
fast during Ramadan, you may not under any circumstances drink alcoholic
beverages in public during the holy month of Ramadan. In most Islamic coun-
tries, if you’re non-Muslim, you can have alcohol in designated public areas,
such as a hotel bar or restaurant. However, during Ramadan, the sale and 
consumption of alcohol is prohibited. To be safe, you’re advised to avoid any
alcoholic drinks during the whole month of Ramadan, whether publicly or 
privately.
Don’t Drink Alcohol in Public
Legally speaking, alcohol use by Muslims is prohibited in most, if not all, Arab
and Islamic countries. Although enforcement of these laws isn’t always consis-
tent, you probably should err on the side of caution and not attract any nega-
tive attention to yourself if you’re a non-Muslim visiting a Muslim country. 
If you’re a Muslim, most bars, restaurants, and hotels offer alcoholic bever-
ages. If you’re inside your hotel room or visiting friends at their house, you
should feel free to enjoy an alcoholic drink (in moderation, of course). If
you’re out in public, then possession and consumption of alcoholic bever-
ages is strictly prohibited. Make sure you keep this in mind before deciding
to open a can of beer out on the beach or in another public space.
Don’t Engage in Public Displays
of Affection
Most Arab and Muslim countries follow strict Islamic social guidelines. These
guidelines change from country to country, but it’s smart to be aware of them
in order to avoid any potentially troubling situations. As a general rule, public
displays of affection are frowned upon in most Islamic countries. In countries
such as Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, most women wear the Hijaab (hee-jab;
veil) and must limit their interactions with the opposite sex. It’s therefore not
a good idea to kiss your girlfriend, boyfriend, fiancé, or even your spouse out
in public. Keep outward affection for your significant other in the comforts of
your own home. If you “accidentally” engage in public displays of affection,
don’t be surprised to receive some disapproving looks.

Don’t Refuse a Gift If One
Is Offered to You
People in the Middle East are known around the world for their incredible
hospitality. If you ever get a chance to visit the region, you’ll be surprised at
how welcoming people are. An incredible social fabric encourages hospital-
ity, and as a result, people love to share their food and their homes with
others. If you’re invited to a Middle Eastern home and are offered a gift — a
piece of jewelry, clothes, food, or other item — it’s considered impolite to
refuse such a gift, no matter how extravagant you may think it is. However,
when you accept a gift, you enter into a social contract: It’s accepted and
understood that you reciprocate by offering another gift in response. But
don’t worry, you don’t have to match gifts in value. As the saying goes, it’s
the thought that counts.

Ten Favorite Arabic Expressions
In This Chapter
 Welcoming someone with open arms
 Using religious expressions appropriately
 Sending your regards
A
rabic uses a lot of very colorful expressions and words, which is to be
expected because Arabic is in fact a very poetic language. Arabic speak-
ers speak Arabic with a burning passion because the words, phrases, and
expressions are so descriptive and conjure up strong visual images.
Linguists have studied the language in order to figure out why Arabic tends
to be much more flowery and descriptive than most languages. One theory
explains this phenomenon by examining the structure of the language itself;
unlike in English and most Romance languages, adjectives in Arabic always
come after the noun. This simple linguistic construct encourages speakers to
use adjectives — some would argue they’re the main ingredients of poetic
sentences — which in turn creates very descriptive sentences. In English,
because adjectives come before the noun, you’re forced to use a limited
number of adjectives before you have to get to the point, the noun.
Whatever the explanation, the passion with which speakers speak Arabic is
sometimes hard to translate. However, if you familiarize yourself with some
common expressions that make Arabic one of the most poetic languages in
the world, you can come close to capturing that spirit! The expressions I
cover in this chapter help you get acquainted with popular phrases in Arabic.
marHaba bikum!
mahr-hah-bah bee-koom; Welcome to all of you!

This term of welcoming is extremely popular with Arabic speakers. It’s usu-
ally said with a lot of zest and enthusiasm and is often accompanied by very
animated hand gestures. It’s not uncommon for someone to say marHaba
bikum and then proceed to hug you or give you a kiss on the cheek! This
expression is a very affectionate form of greeting someone, such as an old
friend, a very special guest, or a close family relative. But the relationship
doesn’t necessarily have to be a close one — if you’re ever invited into a
Middle Eastern home for a dinner or a lunch, don’t be surprised if the host
jovially shouts marHaba bikum and gives you a great big bear hug!
The shortened form of marHaba bikum is to simply say marHaba, which 
literally means “welcome.” You may also say marHaba bika (mahr-hah-bah
bee-kah), which is the masculine singular form of marHaba bikum. (So you
use marHaba bika when greeting a male friend and marHaba biki (mahr-
hah-bah bee-kee) to greet a female friend because biki is the feminine singu-
lar form of bikum.) Finally, if you have a very close relationship with the
person you’re greeting, you may even use a variation of the following expres-
sion: marHaba ya habibi (mahr-hah-bah yah hah-bee-bee; Welcome my dar-
ling [M]) or marHaba ya Habibtii (mahr-hah-bah yah hah-bee-beh-tee;
Welcome my darling [F]).
mumtaaz!
moom-tahz; Excellent!
This expression is used much like “excellent” is used in English: It’s a way to
note that something is going very well. For instance, a teacher may tell her
students mumtaaz if they conjugate a difficult Arabic verb in the past tense,
or a fan may yell mumtaaz if his hometown team scores a goal against an
opponent. mumtaaz is used during joyous events or as a sign of encourage-
ment. It’s a very positive word that Arabic speakers like to use because it
connotes a positive attitude. If you’re having a conversation with a native
speaker, it’s very likely that he or she will use the word mumtaaz a lot for the
duration of the conversation. You should do the same!
al-Hamdu li-llah
al-hahm-doo lee-lah; Praise to God
A number of expressions in the Arabic language make reference to allah for a
very simple reason: As a spoken language, Arabic evolved from the writings
Part IV: The Part of Tens ____________________________________________
306

of the Koran — Islam’s Holy Book — which was recorded soon after the death
of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe that the Koran is actually God’s
words transmitted by the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad.
According to Muslim tradition and belief, the Koran is literally God’s message
to His followers. Therefore, a lot of references to allah come directly from the
Koran. Although spoken Arabic evolved from a religious language based on
the Koran toward one with a more secular and everyday usage, it neverthe-
less retained many of its references to allah. Although they’re based on a
direct reference to allah, many of these phrases are actually used quite casu-
ally nowadays.
al-Hamdu li-llah, which has very wide usage, is a part of everyday Arabic.
Arabic speakers say al-Hamdu li-llah after performing almost any single task,
including finishing a meal, drinking water, finishing a project at work, and run-
ning an errand. The expression’s extensive application goes beyond complet-
ing tasks; for example, if someone asks you, kayf al-Haal? (kah-yef al-hal; How
are you doing?) you may reply, al-Hamdu li-llah and mean “Praise to God; I’m
doing well.” Because of its versatility, it’s customary to hear al-Hamdu 
li-llah quite often when native speakers are talking to each other.
inshaa’ allah
een-shah-ah ah-lah; If God wishes it
If you’ve ever watched Arabic speakers on Arabic TV, you’ve probably heard
them use the expression inshaa’ allah. This expression, which literally means
“If God wishes it” or “If God wills it,” is very popular among Arabic speakers
when discussing future events. It’s almost a rule that whenever someone
brings up an event that will take place in the future, the expression inshaa’
allah follows soon after. For example, when someone asks you how you think
you’re going to do on your next exam, you say, ‘atamannaa ‘an ‘anjaH
inshaa’ allah (ah-tah-mah-nah ann an-jaheen-shah-ah ah-lah; I hope I do well, if
God wishes it). Or if someone asks you if your sister is going to start working
soon, you say, sa-tabda’u al-‘ithnayn inshaa’ allah (sa-tab-dah-oo al-eeth-nah-
yen een-shah-ah ah-lah; she starts on Monday, if God wishes it). Politicians in
particular like to use this expression when someone asks them when they’re
going to hold elections. They say, waqt qariib inshaa’ allah (wah-ket kah-reeb
een-shah-ah ah-lah; Sometime soon, if God wishes it).
307
______________________________ Chapter 19: Ten Favorite Arabic Expressions

mabruk!
mahb-rook; Blessing upon you!
The root of the word mabruk is the noun baraka (bah-rah-kah), which
means “blessing.” mabruk is used at joyous occasions, such as the birth of 
a baby, a wedding, a graduation ceremony, or another festive event. Though
its strict interpretation is “Blessing upon you,” mabruk is just like saying
“Congratulations.” When you say mabruk, make sure you say it with a lot of
energy and enthusiasm!
bi ‘idni allah
bee eed-nee ah-lah; With God’s guidance
This expression is meant to motivate and offer support and guidance, and
although this expression contains a reference to God, it’s actually a lot less
common than expressions such as inshaa’ allah or al-Hamdu li-llah. bii ‘idni
allah is used only during very special occasions, when one is facing serious
challenges or is having difficulty in life, marriage, work, or school. Whenever
someone’s facing hardship, it’s common for him or her to say sa-‘uwaajihu
haadhihi as-su’uubu bi ‘idni allah (sah-oo-wah-jee-hoo hah-zee-hee ah-so-oo-
bah bee eed-nee ah-lah; I will face this difficulty, with God’s guidance). You
can also use bii ‘idni allah to encourage a friend who’s having troubles. You
may tell her, kul shay’ sa-yakun ki-khayr bi‘idniallah (kool shah-yeh sah-yah-
koon kee-kah-yer bee eed-nee ah-lah; All will go well, with God’s guidance).
bi SaHHa
bee sah-hah; With strength
Even though this expression literally means “with strength,” it’s not necessar-
ily used in a context of encouragement or support like bi ‘idni allah is (see
the preceding section). Rather, bi SaHHa is an appropriate thing to say after
someone has finished a difficult task and can relax and enjoy himself. For
example, if a friend has wrapped up writing a book, closed a big deal, or
ended a difficult case, you may say to him bi SaHHa, which signifies that
your friend will be stronger as a result of accomplishing what he’s accom-
plished and now can rest a bit.
Part IV: The Part of Tens ____________________________________________
308

taHiyyaat
tah-hee-yat; Regards
taHiyyaat is a religious term that Muslims use when they’re praying. After a
Muslim finishes praying, he performs the taHiyyaat by turning once to the
right and once to the left, acknowledging the two angels that Muslims believe
guard each person.
In addition to its religious affiliation, Arabic speakers commonly use taHiyyaat
to send their regards. For instance, a friend may say to you, salaam ‘an
‘abuuka (sah-lam ann ah-boo-kah; Say hello to your father for me.) Similarly, to
send your regards to a friend, you say, taHiyyaat.
muballagh
moo-bah-lag; Equally
muballagh is an expression that’s similar to taHiyyaat in that you use it to
send regards. However, unlike taHiyyaat, muballagh is a response; that is,
you use it after someone sends their regards to you. So if someone says to
you, salaam ‘an ‘ukhtuk (sah-lam ann ook-took; Say hello to your sister
for me), you respond, muballagh. Responding with this expression means
that you acknowledge the message and thank the person for it on behalf of
your sister. So make sure to only say muballagh after someone sends their
regards — not before!
tabaaraka allah
tah-bah-rah-kah ah-lah; With God’s blessing
This expression is the equivalent of “God bless you” in English; it’s most com-
monly used among close friends or family members to congratulate each other
on accomplishments, achievements, or other happy events. For instance, if a
son or daughter receives a good grade on an exam, the parents would say,
tabaaraka allah. Another very popular use for this expression is to express
warmth and joy toward kids.

Ten Great Arabic Proverbs
In This Chapter
 Illuminating the meaning of modesty
 Seeking knowledge
 Expressing the importance of teamwork
E
ven if you’ve read only a few chapters of this book, you’ve probably fig-
ured out that Arabic is a very poetic language. One aspect of the lan-
guage that reinforces its poetic nature is the use of ‘amthila (am-thee-lah;
proverbs). Proverbs play an important role in the Arabic language. If you’re
having a conversation with an Arabic speaker or listening to Arabic speakers
converse among themselves, don’t be surprised to hear proverbs peppered
throughout the conversation. This chapter introduces you to some of the
more common and flowery proverbs of the Arabic language.
al-’amthaal noor al-kalaam.
al-am-thal noor al-kah-lam; Proverbs are the light of speech.
The role of proverbs in Arabic is so important that there’s a proverb on the
importance of proverbs!
‘a’mal khayr wa ‘ilqahu fii al-baHr.
ah-mal kah-yer wah eel-kah-hoo fee al-bah-her; Do good and cast it into the sea.
Arab culture emphasizes humility and modesty. This proverb means that
when you commit a charitable act, you shouldn’t go around boasting about it;
rather, you should “cast it into the sea” where no one can find out about it.

‘uTlubuu al-’ilm min al-mahd ‘ilaa al-laHd.
oot-loo-boo al-ee-lem meen al-mahd ee-lah al-lah-hed; Seek knowledge from the
cradle to the grave.
al-’ilm (al-ee-lem; knowledge) is an important virtue in Arabic culture. Arabs
have produced some of the greatest legal, medical, and scientific minds in
history, in no small part because Arabs like to instill in their children a life-
long desire to learn and continue learning every single day of one’s existence.
yad waaHida maa tusaffiq.
yad wah-hee-dah mah too-sah-feek; A hand by itself cannot clap.
This proverb, which is common in the West but originates in Arab culture,
underscores the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and collaboration.
al-Harbaa’ laa Yughaadir shajaratuh
hattaa yakun mu’akkid ‘an shajara
‘ukhraa.
al-har-bah lah yoo-gah-deer shah-jah-rah-tooh hah-tah yah-koon moo-ah-keed
ann shah-jah-rah ook-rah; The chameleon does not leave his tree until he is
sure of another.
This proverb stresses the importance of foresight, planning, and looking
ahead. A chameleon that is mindful of predators won’t change trees until it
knows that it’ll be safe in the next tree it goes to.
khaTa’ ma’roof ‘aHsan min Haqiiqa
ghayr ma’roofa.
kah-tah mah-roof ah-san meen hah-kee-kah gah-yer mah-roo-fah; A known mis-
take is better than an unknown truth.
Part IV: The Part of Tens ____________________________________________
312

This metaphysical proverb has a deep meaning: It’s better for you to identify
and learn from a mistake than to not know a truth at all. In the debate of
known versus unknown knowledge, this proverb indicates that knowing is
better than not knowing, even if what you know is not an absolute truth.
as-sirr mithel al-Hamaama: ‘indamaa
yughaadir yadii yaTiir.
ah-seer mee-thel al-hah-mah-mah: een-dah-mah yoo-gah-deer yah-dee yah-teer; A
secret is like a dove: When it leaves my hand, it flies away.
A secret is meant to be kept close to your chest — in other words, you
shouldn’t divulge a secret. As soon as you let a secret out of your “hand,” it
flies away and spreads around. Just as a dove won’t leave unless you release
it, a secret won’t become known unless you divulge it.
al-’aql li an-niDHaar wa al-kalb 
li as-simaa’.
al-ah-kel lee ah-nee-zar wah al-kah-leb lee ah-see-mah; The mind is for seeing,
and the heart is for hearing.
The mind is to be used for analytical purposes: observation and analysis. The
heart, on the other hand, is for emotions; you should listen and feel with your
heart.
kul yawm min Hayaatuk SafHa 
min taariikhuk.
kool yah-oum meen hah-yah-took saf-hah meen tah-ree-kook; Every day of your
life is a page of your history.
You only live one life, so you should enjoy every single day. At the end, each
day’s experiences are what make up your history.

regarded virtue. This proverb reinforces the idea that elders are respected,
and their counsel is sought often.
