Foreword
Mobile phones, a rarity in many developing countries at the
turn of the century, now seem to be everywhere. Between
2000 and 2012, the number of mobile phones in use world-
wide grew from fewer than 1 billion to around 6 billion. The
mobile revolution is transforming livelihoods, helping to
create new businesses, and changing the way we communi-
cate. The mobile phone network is already the biggest
“machine” the world has ever seen, and now that machine is
being used to deliver development opportunities on a scale
never before imagined. During this second decade of the
new millennium, maximizing the potential of mobile
phones is a challenge that will engage governments, the
private sector, and the development community alike.
Information and Communications for Development
2012: Maximizing Mobile is the third report in the World
Bank Group’s series on Information and Communication
Technologies (ICTs) for Development, originally
launched in 2006. This edition focuses on mobile applica-
tions and their use in promoting development, especially
in agriculture, health, financial services, and government.
Cross-cutting chapters present an overview of emerging
trends in mobile applications, the ways they are affecting
employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, and the
policy challenges presented by the ongoing shift from
narrowband to broadband mobile networks. The report
features at-a-glance tables for 152 economies showing the
latest available data and indicators for the mobile sector
(year-end 2011, where possible). The report also intro-
duces an analytical tool for examining the relevant
performance indicators for each country’s mobile sector,
so policy-makers can assess their capacities relative to
other countries. A more complete range of ICT indicators
is available in the Little Data Book on Information and
Communication Technology 2012, published alongside this
report.
It is our hope that this new report will provide some
emerging good-practice principles for policy-makers, regu-
lators, and investors in this complex and constantly chang-
ing sector. The World Bank Group already supports a wide
range of investment lending programs with an ICT compo-
nent. According to the report of the Independent Evaluation
Group, Capturing Technology for Development (2011),
around three-quarters of all investment lending projects
from the World Bank Group have an ICT component; in
addition, more than $4 billion has been invested directly in
the ICT sector between 2003 and 2010. 
This report marks a shift from the World Bank Group’s
traditional focus on ICT connectivity to a new focus on
applications and on the ways ICTs, especially mobile
phones, are being used to transform different sectors of the
global economy. This change of focus reflects how the
value created by the industry is shifting from networks and
hardware to software and services. The World Bank Group
expects that the theme of transformation will increasingly
guide its investment lending, and this report is aligned with
that new direction. Ultimately, the mission of the World
Bank is to work for a world free of poverty—a goal that is
likely to be achieved more efficiently when ICT investment
is integrated effectively alongside investment in sectors
such as agriculture, health, and government.

Foreword


xiii
The World Bank’s new strategy for engagement in the Infor-
mation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) sector,
which comes into force in 2012, is built around three strate-
gic themes: Innovate—ICT for innovation and ICT-based
services industries; Connect—affordable access to voice, high-
speed internet, information and media; and Transform—ICT
applications to transform services for enhanced development
outcomes.
This new flagship report on Information and Communi-
cations for Development builds on these three themes. In
particular, the report shows how innovation in the manu-
facture of mobile handsets—giving them more memory,
faster processing power, and easier-to-use touchscreen
interfaces—married with higher performance and more
affordable broadband networks and services produces trans-
formation throughout economies and societies. Increas-
ingly, that transformation is coming from developing
countries, which are “more mobile” than developed coun-
tries in the sense that they are following a “mobile first”
development trajectory. Many mobile innovations (includ-
ing multi-SIM card phones, low-cost recharges, and mobile
payments) increasingly originate in poorer countries and
spread from there.
Since the last Information and Communications for
Development report was published, almost 2 billion new
mobile phone subscriptions have been added worldwide,
and the majority of these are in the developing world.
This rapid growth does not show the whole picture,
however. Alongside the process of enlarging the network
is an equally important process of improving the quality
and depth of the network as narrowband networks are
upgraded to broadband and as basic phones and feature-
phones are upgraded to smartphones and tablets. The full
range of innovative mobile applications described in this
report is not yet available in all countries and to all
subscribers, but it soon will be. And the expectation is
that developing countries will invent and adapt their own
mobile applications, suited to local circumstances and
needs. For that reason more research is needed on how
mobile applications are used in base of the pyramid
households.
This report, like its predecessors, was researched and
written jointly by the ICT Sector Unit and by infoDev, a
global partnership program of the World Bank Group. It
has been reviewed by a broad range of experts working in
the field, both within and outside the Bank, whose contri-
butions are gratefully acknowledged. Funding is provided
by the World Bank as well as infoDev’s donors, notably the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Government of
Finland, the Korean Trust Fund for ICT4D, and UKaid.
The World Bank Group is committed to continuing its
analytical and lending operations to support progress and
the sharing of best practices and knowledge, as well as
expanding its investments in private ICT companies to
further growth in the sector, competitiveness, and the
availability of better-quality, affordable ICT services to all
the world’s inhabitants.

Mobile applications not only empower individual users,
they enrich their lifestyles and livelihoods, and boost the
economy as a whole. Indeed, mobile applications now make
phones immensely powerful as portals to the online world. A
new wave of “apps,” or smartphone applications, and “mash-
ups” of services, driven by high-speed networks, social
networking, online crowdsourcing, and innovation, is help-
ing mobile phones transform the lives of people in developed
and developing countries alike. The report finds that mobile
applications not only empower individuals but have impor-
tant cascade effects stimulating growth, entrepreneurship,
and productivity throughout the economy as a whole. Mobile
communications promise to do more than just give the
developing world a voice. By unlocking the genie in the
phone, they empower people to make their own choices and
decisions.
Near ubiquity brings new opportunities. This 2012
edition of the World Bank’s Information and Communica-
tions for Development report analyzes the growth and evolu-
tion of mobile telephony, and the rise of data-based services
delivered to handheld devices, including apps. The report
explores the consequences for development of the emerging
“app economy.” It summarizes current thinking and seeks to
inform the debate on the use of mobile phones for develop-
ment. This report looks at key ecosystem-based applications
in agriculture, health, financial services, employment, and
government, with chapters devoted to each. The story is no

ith some 6 billion mobile subscriptions in
use worldwide, around three-quarters of
the world’s inhabitants now have access to a
mobile phone. Mobiles are arguably the most ubiquitous
modern technology: in some developing countries, more
people have access to a mobile phone than to a bank
account, electricity, or even clean water. Mobile communica-
tions now offer major opportunities to advance human
development—from providing basic access to education or
health information to making cash payments to stimulating
citizen involvement in democratic processes. 
The developing world is “more mobile” than the devel-
oped world. In the developed world, mobile communica-
tions have added value to legacy communication systems
and have supplemented and expanded existing information
flows. However, the developing world is following a differ-
ent, “mobile first” development trajectory. Many mobile
innovations—such as multi-SIM card phones, low-value
recharges, and mobile payments—have originated in poorer
countries and are spreading from there. New mobile appli-
cations that are designed locally and rooted in the realities of
the developing world will be much better suited to address-
ing development challenges than applications transplanted
from elsewhere. In particular, locally developed applications
can address developing-country concerns such as digital
literacy and affordability.

longer about the phone itself, but about how it is used, and
the content and applications to which mobile phones
provide access.
Engaging mobile applications for development
requires an enabling “ecosystem.” Apps are software
“kernels” that sit on a mobile device (typically a smartphone
or tablet) and that can often interact with internet-based
services to, for instance, access updates. Most apps are used
by individual users, but the applications that may prove
most useful for development are those usually developed
within an ecosystem that involves many different players,
including software developers, content providers, network
operators, device manufacturers, governments, and users.
Although the private sector is driving the market, social
intermediaries, such as nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) play an important role in customizing applications
to meet the needs of local communities. In many countries,
a ready-made community of developers has already devel-
oped services based around short message service (SMS) or
instant messaging (IM) and is now developing applications
for more sophisticated devices. Policy-makers need to create
an environment in which players can collaborate as well as
compete. That will require rethinking regulations governing
specific sectors such as financial services, health, or educa-
tion. Governments also play a fundamental role in establish-
ing necessary conditions in which mobile communications
can thrive through the allocation of wireless spectrum,
enactment of vital legislation, and leadership in mobile
government, or mGovernment.
The mobile revolution is right at the start of its
growth curve. Devices are becoming more powerful and
cheaper. But the app economy requires economies of scale
to become viable. The report argues that now is the time
to evaluate what works and to move toward the commer-
cialization, replication, and scaling up of those mobile
apps that drive development. Until recently, most services
using mobiles for development were based on text
messaging. Now, the development of inexpensive smart-
phones and the spread of mobile broadband networks are
transforming the range of possible applications. Several
challenges lie ahead, notably, the fragmentation that
arises from multiple operating systems and platforms. It
is already clear, however, that the key to unleashing the
power of the internet for the developing world lies in the
palm of our hands.
Why are mobile phones now consid-
ered indispensable?
The report’s opening chapter provides an overview of the
key trends shaping and transforming the mobile industry as
well as their impact on development. The chapter examines
the evolution of the mobile phone from a simple channel for
voice to one for exchanging text, data, audio, and video
through the internet. Given technological convergence,
mobile handsets can now function as a wallet, camera, tele-
vision, alarm clock, calculator, address book, calendar, news-
paper, gyroscope, and navigational device combined. The
latest smartphones are not just invading the computer space,
they are reinventing it by offering so much more in both
voice and nonvoice services.
Developing countries are increasingly well placed to
exploit the benefits of mobile communications, with levels
of access rising around the world. Chapter 1 explores the
implications of the emergence of high-speed broadband
networks in developing countries, and how the bond
between mobile operators and users is loosening, as
computer and internet companies invade the mobile space,
with a growing number of handset models now offering 
Wi-Fi capability. 
The chapter also examines the size and nature of the
mobile economy and the emergence of new players in the
mobile ecosystem. The emergence of apps, or special soft-
ware on handheld devices that interacts with internet-based
data services, means that the major issue for the develop-
ment community today is no longer basic access to mobile
phones but about what can be done with phones. More than
30 billion apps had been downloaded worldwide by early
2012, and they make for an innovative and diverse mobile
landscape with a potentially large impact on the lives of
people in developed and developing countries alike. Grow-
ing opportunities for small-scale software developers and
local information aggregators are allowing them to develop,
invent, and adapt apps to suit their individual needs. Users
themselves are becoming content providers on a global scale.
Indeed, the latest generations of mobile telephony are
sowing social and political as well as economic transforma-
tion. Farmers in Africa are accessing pricing information
through text messages, mothers can receive medical reports
on the progression of their pregnancy by phone, migrant
workers can send remittances without banks. Elections are

monitored and unpopular regimes toppled with the help of
mobile phones. Texting and tweeting have become part of
modern vocabulary. 
Mobiles are now creating unprecedented opportunities
for employment, education, and entertainment in develop-
ing countries. This chapter looks beyond specific examples
to identify the broader trends shaping and redefining our
understanding of the word “mobile.”
A mobile green revolution
Given the dominance of primary commodities in the
economies of many developing countries, chapter 2 explores
the all-important area of mobile applications designed to
improve incomes, productivity, and yields within the agri-
cultural sector, which accounts for about 40 percent of the
workforce and an even greater proportion of exports in
many developing countries. 
To date, voice calls and SMS text messages have proven
invaluable in increasing efficiency in smallholder agriculture.
They can, for example, provide real-time price information
and improve the flow of information along the entire value
chain, from producers to processors to wholesalers to retail-
ers to consumers. The basic functions of the mobile phone
will continue to remain important for reaching the widest
number of people, but the focus of applications development
is shifting as the underlying technologies evolve. 
Today, increasingly specialized mobile services are fulfill-
ing specific agricultural functions, while multimedia
imagery is being used to overcome illiteracy and provide
complex information regarding weather and climate, pest
control, cultivation practices, and agricultural extension
services to potentially less tech-savvy farmers. This chapter
also examines the emerging uses of remote and satellite tech-
nologies that are assisting in food traceability, sensory detec-
tion, real-time reporting, and status updates from the field.
It further reviews examples of mobile services in agriculture
to draw key learning points and provide direction on how to
capitalize on successful examples. 
Mobile applications for agriculture and rural develop-
ment have generally not followed any generic blueprint. They
are usually designed locally and for specific target markets,
with localized content specific to the languages, crop types,
and farming methods. Local design offers exciting opportu-
nities for local content and applications development but
may limit the economies of scale realizable from expand-
ing from pilot programs into mass markets, potentially
hindering the spread of new and promising applications
and services.
The full scope and scale of smartphones and tablets for
providing services to agricultural stakeholders have yet to
emerge. An enabling environment that can promote the
development and use of applications in developing coun-
tries must be prioritized to meet the information needs of
the agricultural sector.
Keep using the tablets—how mobile
devices are changing health care 
Chapter 3 examines some of the key principles and charac-
teristics of mobile for health (mHealth), and how mobiles
are helping transform and enhance the delivery of primary
and secondary health care services in developing countries.
Mobile health can save money and deliver more effective
health care with relatively limited resources; increasingly, it is
associated with a focus on prevention of diseases and
promotion of healthy lifestyles. 
This chapter reviews on-the-ground implementations
of medical health care apps to draw key conclusions about
how mHealth can best be implemented to serve the needs
of people in the developing world, as well as identifying
barriers that must be overcome. It considers some of the
unique features of the health care sector and the implica-
tions for medical apps in areas such as patient privacy and
confidentiality, public and private provision of care, and
real-time reporting requirements in crisis or emergency
situations.
Modern health care systems are at a tipping point, as
consumers take on greater responsibility for managing their
own health care choices, and mobile phones could enable a
shift in the locus of decision-making away from the state and
health institutions to individual patients. 
The most substantial challenge for mHealth, however, is
the establishment of sustainable business models that can be
replicated and scaled up. One step toward addressing this
challenge might be a clearer delineation of roles within the
health ecosystem between public and private health care
providers. Another significant challenge is the effective
monitoring and evaluation of mobiles in health, as pilot
programs continue to proliferate.

Mobile money
This chapter examines the all-important topic of mobile
money as a general platform and critical infrastructure under-
pinning other economic sectors. Mobile money has trans-
formed the Kenyan economy, where mobile-facilitated
payments now equate to a fifth of the country’s gross domestic
product (GDP). The impact of mobile money is widening else-
where too, as it is adopted across commerce, health insurance,
agricultural banking, and other sectors. Today, the potential of
mobile payment systems to “bank the unbanked” and empower
the poor through improved access to finance and lower trans-
action costs is generating growing excitement. Where they
exist, mature mobile money systems have often spun off inno-
vative products and services in insurance, credit, and savings.
When connected on a large scale, evidence suggests that
the poor are able to use mobile money to improve their
livelihoods. Observers remain divided, however, about
whether mobile money systems are fulfilling their true
growth potential. Innovative offerings, old and new, can
succeed only if there is sufficient demand from consumers
and firms—a variable missing in many contexts.
The mobile money industry exists at the intersection of
banking and telecommunications, embracing a diverse set of
stakeholders, including mobile operators, financial services
companies, and new entrants (such as payment card firms).
In some countries, mobile money systems may be subject to
different regulatory practices and interoperability issues, not
to mention clashes in culture between banks and mobile
operators, so developing the necessary cross-sectoral partner-
ships can prove difficult. In other countries, well-developed
alternative legacy systems are strong competitors to the
development of mobile money systems.
This chapter evaluates the benefits and potential impact
of mobile money, especially for promoting financial inclu-
sion in the developing world. It provides an overview of the
key factors driving the growth of mobile money services,
while considering some of the barriers and obstacles hinder-
ing their deployment. Finally, it identifies emerging issues
that the industry will face over the coming years. 
Get a phone, get a job, start a 
business
The global mobile industry is today a major source of
employment opportunities, on both the supply and demand
side. Employment opportunities in the mobile industry can
be categorized as direct jobs, indirect jobs, and jobs on the
demand side. The contribution of the mobile communica-
tion sector to employment and entrepreneurship to date is
difficult to assess, however, because the seemingly simple
mobile phone can generate—and occasionally eliminate—
employment opportunities by creating efficiencies and
lowering transaction and information costs.
The recent rapid innovation in the mobile sector has
generated significant disruptive technological change and
uncertainty. This turmoil is also lowering barriers to entry,
however, and generating fresh opportunities for small and
young firms and entrepreneurs to displace legacy systems,
innovate, and grow.
Chapter 5 showcases some of the mechanisms by which
the mobile sector supports entrepreneurship and job
creation. Some share similarities with traditional donor
initiatives, but many are novel ideas, for which the “proof of
concept” has been demonstrated only recently or has yet to be
demonstrated. This chapter considers the use of specialized
business incubators or mobile labs (mLabs) for supporting
entrepreneurial activity in the mobile industry, as well as new
opportunities that are offered in areas such as the virtual
economy (trading goods and services that exist only online)
or mobile microwork (work carried out remotely on a
mobile device, on micro-tasks, such as tagging images). 
It also provides suggestions on how to support entrepre-
neurship and job creation in the mobile industry. In an
industry evolving as quickly as the mobile sector is today, it
is vital to tailor support to local circumstances and to evalu-
ate impact regularly.
Using phones to bring governments
and citizens closer
In the public sphere, mobiles now serve as vehicles for
improved service delivery and greater transparency and
accountability. Today, governments are beginning to embrace
the potential for mobile phones to put public services literally
into the pocket of each citizen, create interactive services, and
promote accountable and transparent governance. 
Chapter 6 identifies a range of uses for mobiles in
government (mGovernment) that supplement existing
public services, expand their user base, and generate spin-
off services. The revolutionary aspect to mGovernment lies
in making government available, anytime and anywhere, to
6

anyone. The chapter also provides a range of examples of
mGovernment from around the world as well as a range of
best practices and recommendations. It demonstrates how
countries can play a constructive role in enhancing sustain-
ability and enabling scale, while maximizing the impact of
mGovernment programs. 
An important conclusion is that bottom-up ad hoc
approaches to mGovernment may endanger economies of
scale. Top-down coordinated approaches may be preferable,
since they can cut costs in designing, deploying, and operat-
ing apps; consolidate demand for communication services
across government, thereby eliminating duplication; and
include focused actions to build capacity and skills.
Emerging best practices suggest that any government
considering the opportunities inherent in mGovernment
should focus on enabling technological transformation and
building the institutional capacity needed to respond to citi-
zens’ demands. Governments looking to adopt mobile tools
to become responsive, accountable, and transparent should
bear in mind that this process will prove successful and truly
transform the government-citizen relationship only when
governments take into account both elements—“mobile”
and “government.”
Onward and upward to mobile
broadband
Chapter 7 distinguishes between supply-side policies (which
seek to promote the expansion of wireless broadband
networks) and demand-side policies (which seek to boost
adoption of wireless broadband services) in the mobile
broadband ecosystem. 
Supply-side policies seek to address bottlenecks and market
failures that constrain network expansion and provide incen-
tives for broader wireless broadband coverage. The chapter
reviews the following supply-side policy recommendations:
• Boosting the availability of quality spectrum to deploy
cost-effective wireless broadband networks
• Eliminating technological or service restrictions on spec-
trum
• Focusing on expanding network coverage rather than on
profiting from spectrum auctions
• Requiring transparency in traffic management and safe-
guarding competition 
• Limiting spectrum hoarding, which could distort
competitive conditions in the market 
• Fostering the development of national backbone broad-
band networks 
• Encouraging infrastructure and spectrum sharing
Demand-side policies aim at boosting growth in the
adoption of wireless broadband services by addressing barri-
ers to adoption and fostering the development of innovative
broadband services and applications pulling users’ demand
toward mobile broadband. The chapter reviews the follow-
ing demand-side policy recommendations:
• Improving the availability and affordability of broad-
band-enabled devices
• Boosting the affordability of broadband services
• Fostering the development of broadband services and
applications
The chapter concludes that appropriate policy action
requires addressing both the supply- and demand-sides of the
mobile broadband ecosystem. Policy-makers must evaluate
local market conditions before applying specific policies
addressing bottlenecks or market failures. The most common
breakdowns on the supply side are lack of available spectrum
and inadequate backbone networks; on the demand side, the
main constraints are lack of affordable mobile devices and
broadband services, as well as limited local applications and
content. Ultimately, policy-makers must determine which
policies to adopt, and how to implement them, based on
domestic circumstances and the likely effectiveness of the
policy for broadband diffusion in the context of each country.

obile communication has arguably had a
bigger impact on humankind in a shorter
period of time than any other invention in
human history. As noted by Jeffrey Sachs (2008), who
directed the United Nations Millennium Project: “Mobile
phones and wireless internet end isolation, and will there-
fore prove to be the most transformative technology of
economic development of our time.” 
The mobile phone has evolved from a simple voice device
to a multimedia communications tool capable of download-
ing and uploading text, data, audio, and video—from text
messages to social network updates to breaking news, the
latest hit song, or the latest viral video. A mobile handset can
be used as a wallet, a compass, or a television, as well as an
alarm clock, calculator, address book, newspaper, and camera. 
Mobiles are also contributing to social, economic, and
political transformation. Farmers in Africa obtain pricing
information via text messages, saving time and travel and
making them better informed about where to sell their prod-
ucts, thereby raising their incomes (World Bank 2011a, 353).
In India barbers who do not have a bank account can use
mobiles to send money to relatives in villages, saving costs
and increasing security (Adler and Uppal 2008, 25). Elec-
tions are monitored and unpopular regimes toppled with
the help of mobile phones (Brisson and Krontiris 2012, 75).
Texting and tweeting have become part of the vocabulary
(Glotz, Bertschi, and Locke 2005, 199). 
Developing countries are increasingly well situated to
exploit the benefits of mobile communications. First and
foremost, levels of access are high and rising. The number of
mobile subscriptions in low- and middle-income countries
increased by more than 1,500 percent between 2000 and
2010, from 4 to 72 per 100 inhabitants (figure 1.1a). Second,
the age profile of developing nations is younger than in
developed countries, an important advantage in the mobile
world where new trends are first taken up by youth.1 Those
under age 15 make up 29 percent of the population in low-
and middle-income economies but just 17 percent in high-
income nations (figure 1.1b). Third, developing countries
are growing richer, so more consumers can afford to use
mobile handsets for more than just essential voice calls.
Between 2000 and 2010 incomes in low- and middle-income
nations tripled (figure 1.1c). Fourth, the mobile sector has
become a significant economic force in developing
economies. Mobile revenues as a proportion of gross
national income (GNI) rose from 0.9 percent in 2000 to 
1.5 percent in 2010 (figure 1.1d). 
These changes are creating unprecedented opportunities
for employment, education, and empowerment in develop-
ing countries. Local content portals are springing up to
satisfy the hunger for news and other information that
previously had been difficult to access. The nature of the
mobile industry itself is changing dramatically, opening new
opportunities for developing nations in designing mobile

consumers to add content and applications to their mobile
phones. Mobile operators are struggling to keep pace with an
explosion of data, while networks are converging toward
Internet Protocol (IP) technologies and relying on content
and data to substitute for declining voice revenues. An
increasingly hybrid wireless communications ecosystem will
evolve over the coming years. 
Although mobile communication is rapidly advancing in
most parts of the world, a significant segment of the world’s
population remains unable to use the latest mobile tech-
nologies. Mobile broadband coverage is often limited to
urban areas, and current smartphone prices are not afford-
able for many. Nonetheless, developing-country users are
using what they have. Text messaging, mobile money, and
simple internet access work on many low-end phones. An
emerging ecosystem of local developers is supporting
narrowband mobile communicating through scaled-down

applications and developing content, piloting products and
services, and becoming innovation hubs. Trendy mobile
products and services may be launched in Silicon Valley or
Helsinki, but mobile manufacturing usually takes place else-
where, creating huge opportunities to service, support, and
develop applications locally. While key mobile trends are
generally adopted around the world, regions such as East
Asia are forging their own path for content and applications.
New mobile innovation centers are springing up in Beijing,
Seoul, and Tokyo, with expertise in specific markets such as
mobile gaming and contactless banking.
The emergence of mobile broadband networks, coupled
with computer-like handsets, is causing rapid shifts in the
ecosystem of the sector. The bond between mobile operators
and users is loosening as computer and internet companies
invade the mobile space and handsets increasingly offer Wi-Fi
capability. Online stores have created a new way for

web browsers, text messaging, social networking, and pay-
as-you-go mobile data access. For many users, especially in
rural areas, these changes are happening where finding the
electricity to recharge a phone is more difficult than
purchasing prepaid airtime. 
These developments have major implications for the state
of access to information and communication technologies
(ICTs) in the 21st century. Rich countries have the luxury of
both wired and wireless technology, of both personal
computers (PCs) and smartphones. Developing countries
tend to rely mainly on mobile networks, and phones already
vastly outnumber PCs. Applications have to be different to
work on small screens and virtual keyboards, while conver-
gence is happening apace. The developed world is also now
becoming “more mobile,” with average screen size shrinking;
while the developing world is now becoming, “more
connected,” forging ahead with the shift from narrowband
to broadband networks on a mobile rather than a fixed plat-
form. Demography is on the side of the developing world,
and the economies of scale gained from serving these
expanding markets may push the ICT industry as a whole in
the direction of a post-PC, untethered world.
One of the challenges facing a report of this nature is
that the industry is evolving so rapidly. What is written
today is often outdated tomorrow. In addition, given the
novelty of many developments and a lack of stable defini-
tions and concepts, official data are scarce or fail to address
important market trends. Information from secondary
sources is often contradictory, inconsistent, or self-serving.
Information about mobile culture is particularly scarce in
developing countries. Nevertheless, certain trends are visi-
ble, and this opening chapter explores key trends shaping
and redefining our understanding of the word “mobile” as
an entrée to the review of different sectors in the chapters
that follow.
How mobile phones are used
Voice 
With all the attention given to mobile broadband, smart-
phones, and mobile applications, it is sometimes easy to forget
that voice communication is still the most significant function
and the primary source of revenue for mobile operators. 
Voice usage varies considerably both across and within
countries. For example, the average Chinese user talks on a
mobile phone more than seven times longer per month than
the average Moroccan (figure 1.2a). Price is a major factor in
calling patterns, with a clear relation between monthly
minutes of use and the price per minute. Interconnection
fees between operators are a main determinant of price. In
some countries these wholesale rates do not reflect underly-
ing costs that drive up the price of mobile calls. A second
factor relates to whether the subscriptions are paid in
advance (prepaid) or paid on the basis of a contract (post-
paid). Prepaid subscriptions are much more popular in
developing economies, where incomes may be less stable,
but postpaid contracts tend to generate higher usage per
subscriber (figure 1.2b).
As with fixed networks, a growing proportion of traffic
from mobile devices is moving to Voice over Internet Proto-
col (VoIP), often routed over Wi-Fi rather than the cellular
network, thereby avoiding per-minute usage charges.
According to CISCO, a major supplier of IP networking
equipment, mobile VoIP traffic is forecast to grow
42 percent between 2010 and 2015.2 Although mobile VoIP
accounts for a tiny share of total mobile data traffic, its
value impact on mobile operators is much greater. Skype, a
leading VoIP provider, has reported over 19 million down-
loads of its iPhone application since its launch in 2009. In
addition to voice and video, Skype processed 84 million
SMS text messages during the first half of 2010.3 One study
forecasts 288 million mobile VoIP users by 2013 (van
Buskirk 2010).
Not just for voice anymore
Although voice is still the main revenue generator, its growth
has slowed (TeleGeography 2012) as data and text-based
applications have grown in popularity, their use made possi-
ble by advances in cell phone technology (box 1.1). Mobile
applications are the main theme of this book. For many
people, a mobile phone is one of the most used and useful
appliances they own. Built-in features are indispensable to
many for checking the time, setting an alarm, taking photos,
performing calculations, and a variety of other daily tasks.
Downloadable applications can extend functionalities. 
A number of nonvoice applications use wireless networks
on a one-off basis (to download, for example); other appli-
cations (such as incoming email notifications) are always on.
Stand-alone features mean that users do not necessarily need
to use a mobile network. For example, downloading of
content or applications can be carried out from a PC and
then transferred to a mobile phone, or such tasks can be

The use of mobile phones has evolved dramatically over time and will continue to do so at an
ever faster pace, so it is important to define some terms that are used throughout this report,
while noting that these definitions are not necessarily stable. Many mobile handsets, particularly
in the developing world are so-called basic phones, based on the second-generation (2G) GSM
(Global System for Mobile communications) standard, first introduced in 1991. GSM offers a
number of different services embedded in the standard and therefore available on all GSM-
compatible devices, however basic. These include short message service (SMS) text messages
of up to 160 characters, and instant messaging using the USSD (Unstructured Supplementary
Service Data) protocol. Many of the older “mobile applications,” particularly in the developing
world, are based on SMS or USSD, because they do not require additional data services or user
downloads and are available on virtually any device. Strictly speaking, however, these should be
considered network services rather than applications (box table 1.1.1). Internet-enabled hand-
sets, or feature phones, were introduced with the launching of data services over mobile
networks in the early 2000s. These phones supported transmission of picture messages and the
downloading of music and often included a built-in camera. Smartphones appeared in the late
2000s. They typically feature graphical interfaces and touchscreen capability, built-in Wi-Fi, and
GPS (global positioning system) capability. 
Smartphones with memories and internet access are also able to download applications,
or “apps,” pieces of software that sit on the phone’s memory and carry out specific functions,
Box 1.1 Mobile phones and applications

like accessing websites or reporting the phone’s location and status. In this report, the term
“apps” is used to denote such applications that may be downloaded and used on the
device, either with or without a fee, in a stand-alone mode. The most popular apps are
games. More than 30 billion apps had been downloaded as of early 2012 (Gartner 2012;
Paul 2012). Using mobile applications for development usually requires more than simply
downloading an app to a user device, however. Specifically, the most useful mobile appli-
cations, such as those discussed in this report, typically require an ecosystem of content
providers (for instance, reporting price data for agricultural produce, discussed in chapter
2) or agents (such as those providing cash upload facilities for mobile financial services,
discussed in chapter 4). These kinds of “ecosystem-based mobile applications” are the
main topic of this report. 
However, technological change continues apace. Newer generations of mobile application
may be “cloud based,” in the sense that data is stored by servers on the internet rather than
locally on the device. Applications that use HTML5 (the current generation of hypertext mark-
up language), for instance, may not require any software to be downloaded. Such applica-
tions may have the advantage that they can be used independently of the network or mobile
device that the user is currently using. For instance, a music track stored on the “cloud”
might be accessed from a user’s tablet, smartphone, or PC, and even when the user is roam-
ing abroad. But such a shift depends on much lower prices, without monthly caps, for mobile
data  transmission.

carried out over Wi-Fi. Indeed, the “mobile” in “mobile
applications” refers as much to the type of device as the
manner of usage. 
A survey (Pew Research Center 2011) carried out across a
range of countries at varying economic levels and in differ-
ent regions illustrates the varied uses of mobile phones
(figure 1.3). After voice usage, text messaging is the most
widely used: in more than half the countries surveyed, three-
quarters of mobile phone owners sent text messages; in
Indonesia virtually all mobile users sent text. Although usage
rates vary, mobile devices were used to access the internet in
all surveyed countries, with almost a quarter of cell phone
owners using this feature on average. 
Messaging
Despite the attention focused on more glamorous mobile
applications, text messaging (or SMS) is a popular and
profitable nonvoice application in many countries. Close
to 5 trillion text messages were sent worldwide in 2010
(figure 1.4a) accounting for 80 percent of operator
revenue from value-added-services, or $106 billion
(Informa 2011). This is an attractive revenue source for
operators because the cost of transmitting text messages is
so low. Although its use in some countries is now starting
to decline in favor of instant messaging and phone-based
email, SMS remains an alternative for costly voice calls in
some countries or suffices for users who do not have
access to the internet on their mobiles (or do not know
how to use it). Messaging has become popular as a feed-
back mechanism for voting on TV reality shows and a way
of providing value-added services such as banking or pric-
ing information. As a form of asynchronous (that is, non-
real-time) communication, it is particularly useful for
coordinating meetings or reaching correspondents who
are not available to talk (Ling and Donner 2009). Text
messaging is also important for applications in the
mobile-for-development arena. Many agricultural pricing
and health programs for rural dwellers revolve around

SMS, and text messaging is used by several governments
for citizen alerts. 
Twitter, a social networking “microblog” launched in
2006, is also based on short messages, or “tweets,” which
are intentionally similar to the length of a text message
and therefore a good fit for mobile phone use.4 Around 
40 million people (some 37 percent of all Twitter users)
were “tweeting” from their mobile devices in April 2010; a
year later that number exceeded 100 million (Watters
2010).5 By March 2012 Twitter users were sending 
340 million tweets a day (figure 1.4b).6 Twitter is inte-
grated with SMS, so tweets can be sent and received as
text messages. Twitter short codes have been implemented
for several countries so that most SMS tweets are charged
at domestic rates. Twitter is working with mobile opera-
tors to lower the cost of sending tweets through SMS or
USSD or even to make them free. Twitter has rapidly
emerged as a tool for social activism and citizen engage-
ment ranging from the Delhi police tweeting traffic
updates7 to tweeting the revolution in the Arab Republic
of Egypt.8
Web browsing
Access to the internet via a web browser on a mobile device
varies across countries depending on costs, education,
speeds, and content. Overall, usage is growing, however,
with an estimated 10 percent of global internet access
coming from mobile phones in 2010, up from 4 percent in
2005. Most popular websites have special versions adapted
to mobile devices, although customized mobile browsers,
such as Opera, are suited to featurephones.9 On most
smartphones, users are encouraged to download applica-
tions from special app stores, sometimes belonging to the
operator but increasingly owned by the device platform
(such as Apple, Android, Windows, and Blackberry). That
arrangement has the convenience of ensuring that the
application is suitable for the smaller screen size of mobile
devices, although the full range of internet content is still
available through a web browser. 
Social networking is popular, ranking in the top 10
among mobile internet use in practically every country.
Facebook is predominant except in countries such as China
and the Russian Federation, where local social networking
sites are used. More than 425 million people accessed Face-
book through their mobile devices in December 2011.10
East Asia in particular is bucking the trend toward use of
global applications. The main reason is large domestic
markets (such as China, Japan, Republic of Korea), which
use non-western alphabets and create huge demand for local
content and applications. China Mobile, the world’s largest
mobile operator, has developed its own applications that
mimic global trends in areas such as mobile money, ebooks,
video, music, and gaming. But these application are basically
closed systems, unfathomable to users that do not speak
Chinese and not easily exportable to other countries. 
The most downloaded applications for smartphone
portals include utilities for tools such as mapping, social
networking, chatting, and messaging (table 1.1). 
One genre in every list of top downloads across all appli-
cation portals and all regions is games. The popularity of

games has made millionaires of some application developers
(box 1.2) and attests to the significant financial impact the
gaming sector is having on the mobile industry.
Games are particularly big in East Asia, accounting for
almost half of the estimated global mobile gaming revenue
of $5.5 billion in 2008 (Portio Research 2009). In Korea
the mobile games sector was worth 424.2 billion won
($390 million) in 2010 even though games downloaded
from smartphone application stores operated by Apple and
Android were considered illegal because of the government
ratings system.11 That ratings system is set to be loosened,
which will likely lead to further market growth. In Japan the
mobile games market was estimated to be worth 88.4 billion
yen ($1 billion) in 2009 (Toto 2011). China Mobile reported
that it had 4.6 million paying users of its online library of
3,000 games in 2010.12
The popularity of mobile games and the size of the
sector holds opportunities in the areas of software devel-
opment, virtual cash, and local customization (Lehdon-
virta 2011). The traits of game playing, such as acquiring
points, leveling, and solving challenges are also entering
other fields where applications are used, such as educa-
tion or social media, in a process called “gamification.”
The thinking is that users who have become accustomed
to using games on their mobile devices would then be
more comfortable using similar thought processes in
areas that are not entertainment-oriented, including
health or business.
Data traffic 
Growing mobile data usage is triggering explosive growth in
traffic. Social networking entails considerable photo and
video exchange and is the leading generator of traffic in
many countries (Opera Software 2011). YouTube, the video
portal, ranks among the top 10 web applications in most
countries. According to CISCO (2012), video is expected to
account for more than two-thirds of all mobile traffic in
2016, and mobile data traffic will increase 18-fold between
2011 and 2016.
Mobile operators are struggling to handle all this data
and control the traffic. They are adding as much capacity as
they can to their networks within investment and spectrum
constraints. They are also off-loading traffic to Wi-Fi wher-
ever possible. The most common method for controlling, or
“shaping,” traffic is through data caps on mobile data plans.
Few operators offer truly unlimited mobile data plans, and
the cost of exceeding caps can be steep, with users facing a
loss or severe disruption of service and dramatically reduced
speeds. The case of Hong Kong SAR, China, illustrates well

the impending wave of data usage that will soon be hitting
other countries (figure 1.5a). During 2011 average monthly
mobile data usage increased by more than 70 percent to over
500 megabytes (MB) per 2.5G or 3G user. Although Hong
Kong is an advanced economy, and therefore well ahead of
most developing nations, the same trends can be expected
elsewhere at a later date. CISCO (2012) forecasts monthly
usage to reach more than 10 exabytes (that is, 1 billion giga-
bytes) in 2016, with smartphones, laptops, tablets, and
mobile broadband networks leading the charge (figure 1.5b).
This subject is developed further in chapter 7.
The changing mobile ecosystem 
Before the emergence of smartphones, network operators
had historically controlled the mobile ecosystem. They
were the main point of interface for users regarding devices
and applications. Although users were free to purchase
their own handsets, operators typically subsidized them
where regulation allowed them to do so, at least for the
postpaid segment. Users who wanted to talk, send a
message, or access the internet did so over the mobile oper-
ator’s network. Access was often through an operator’s
“walled garden”—a portal where content providers paid
operators to feature their applications. If users went
outside the walled garden, they typically had to pay extra.
Developments such as value-added text messages and
mobile payments widened this ecosystem, but operators
essentially remained the gatekeepers. 
The app revolution 
Operator control started to break down with the emer-
gence of smartphones and other devices that run specific
mobile operating systems, incorporate built-in Wi-Fi, and
allow users to purchase content and applications through
special online stores. The first kink in the direct relation-
ship between operators and users was the BlackBerry,
introduced by Canadian company Research in Motion
(RIM) in January 1999. Marketed as “wearable wireless
email,”13 the BlackBerry could arguably be called the world’s
first smartphone. Revolutionary at the time, it allowed
subscribers to receive email using RIM’s proprietary Enter-
prise Server. The BlackBerry was a big hit within the corpo-
rate world because it ensured that key personnel could
receive emails anytime, anywhere. RIM later expanded
BlackBerry distribution to reach mass markets, earning $20
billion in revenue in its 2010 fiscal year. RIM has moved
into emerging markets and into social networking through
its BlackBerry Messenger. The company shipped 52 million
devices in its 2010 fiscal year and had some 55 million
subscribers in November 2010 (figure 1.6a).14 BlackBerry
App World launched in 2009, but having been an early
trendsetter, it is now struggling to keep up with develop-
ments elsewhere.
Overview

Angry Birds has been a worldwide game sensation. It was the number one Apple iPhone
download in countries ranging from Pakistan to Peru and the Philippines to Portugal. Rovio
Mobile, a Finnish firm founded in 2003, developed Angry Birds.a
In 2009 Rovio released Angry Birds for the iPhone. The company’s development of Angry
Birds outlines the relationships between game developers, publishers, and giant gaming
companies. Rovio initially worked with publisher Chillingo to develop the iPhone version of
Angry Birds, keeping the rights for versions on other platforms. Following the sale of Chillingo
to gaming company Electronic Arts in October 2010, Rovio developed its own Angry Birds
versions for other mobile systems such as Android and Nokia. It is also leveraging its Angry
Birds success by expanding into merchandizing with T-shirts and other products. 
According to one source, Angry Birds had over 5 million downloads from the Apple app
store during the first six months of 2010 alone (Parker 2010). At $0.99 a download, the game
generated at least $5 million in revenue during that period.

Box 1.2 How to make a million from Angry Birds

The industry changed dramatically with the introduction
of Apple’s touchscreen iPhone in June 2007, followed by the
launch of its App Store in July 2008.15 The exclusive agree-
ments that Apple initially made with mobile operators have
now largely ended. In January 2010 the company crossed
another milestone, introducing the iPad, its tablet computer.
All Apple mobile devices (such as iPhone, iPad, and the iPod
music player) are powered by the iOS mobile operating
system. The iPhone is distributed through Apple’s retail and
online stores and also by mobile carriers. In addition to the
App Store, iPhone users can download music and video
from the iTunes store and ebooks from the iBookstore. 
By simplifying and taking ownership of the application
platform, handset vendors were able to exert control over the
quality of applications on offer and also to create a market for
purchasing them. Although the majority of downloaded appli-
cations are still free, users are urged to upgrade to paid content
or subscriptions, if only to get rid of advertising. By February

2011 Apple had downloaded more than 25 billion applications
from the App Store. Sales of the iPhone grew from 1.4 million
in 2007 to 72 million in 2011 (figure 1.6b). Revenues from the
iPhone and related products and services grew to $47 billion in
2011, accounting for 44 percent of Apple’s total sales.16 An
equipment-selling business is rapidly becoming a software-
and-services industry, with operators scrambling to provide
the spectrum bandwidth to carry the heavy volumes of data
traffic while plotting their own applications portals. 
Android, Inc., was founded in 2003 to develop mobile
phone operating systems and then purchased by search giant
Google in 2005. Google made the Android software open
source to encourage programmers and handset manufactur-
ers to develop applications and products. The first Android
handset, the HTC Dream, was launched in October 2008.
Google itself has self-branded several Android phones and
developed Android Market (now called Google Play), a
portal for obtaining Android applications. By the fourth
quarter of 2011 Android had captured just over half the
market for smartphone operating systems (Gartner 2012).
Google Play offers more than 400,000 applications with over
10 billion downloaded by January 2012 (Paul 2012).
Another significant player is mobile equipment manufac-
turer Nokia. It has traditionally had a large market share of
the handset market, especially in the developing world
(figure 1.7). Nokia’s mobile operating system, Symbian, is
installed on most of these handsets. Thus far, however, Nokia
has failed to capture a large share of the smartphone market.
In 2011 it forged an agreement with Microsoft to begin offer-
ing the Windows operating system on its smartphones.17
The rise of smartphones thus sparked tremendous shifts
in the mobile ecosystem. A user can now bypass mobile
networks completely by downloading content and programs
through application stores using Wi-Fi. One survey reported
that half the respondents used Wi-Fi to download applica-
tions to their mobile phones (In-Stat 2011). Second, users
can use VoIP or other applications to communicate instead
of the operator’s mobile voice service. Third, most handset
manufacturers are essentially constrained to using the
Android or Windows mobile operating systems for their
handsets because RIM and Apple brand their own devices. 
As a result of the rise of the smartphone, operators have
much less control over the mobile ecosystem. They risk being
“genericized,” where users do not care about the mobile
network brand but instead whether it has the fastest speed,
best coverage, cheapest prices, highest quality, or biggest
subsidy for popular handsets. Prepaid users, in particular,
have little brand loyalty, with high rates of churn in markets
where mobile number portability is a regulatory obligation.
In some ways, this process is a repeat of the one that occurred
in the early 2000s when the rise of the internet threatened to
commoditize the “dumb pipes” of telecom operators, only
now it is the mobile operators that are under pressure. At the
same time, the emergence of HTML5 could cause another
disruption in the industry. With the HTML5 standard, apps
can be run directly from web browsers, freeing users from

being locked in to a proprietary operating system and creat-
ing a new distribution channel for application developers
(A.T. Kearney 2011).
Mobile content 
The evolution of handsets has driven content providers and
aggregators to the mobile industry. In the early days, content
largely consisted of ringtones and screen pictures down-
loaded to customize simple mobile phones. As handsets
become more sophisticated and included internet access,
more and more of the “big” internet can be reformatted to
mobile content, making the “third” screen (after television
and PCs) a desirable outlet for the content industry. Content
providers have also been aided by the rise of application
stores, which allow users to navigate easily to online super-
markets to satisfy their content cravings. 
While big technology and media companies dominate
content distribution and to some extent content creation,
there are opportunities for small software developers and
local information aggregators. Examples of these aggrega-
tors include:
• Seven out of ten Brazilian internet users visit Brazil’s
UOL internet portal, formerly Universo Online. It created
a mobile version, UOL Celular, with more than 1,000
daily news, weather, and traffic reports. It ranks as the
10th most visited site by Brazilian Opera mobile browser
users and the second-leading local site. 
• Detikcom is the third most visited site by Indonesian
Opera users. It was launched in 1998 and introduced a
mobile version in 2002, significantly contributing to
growth. It envisions itself as a new media company with
partnerships for content and relationships with the coun-
try’s mobile operators to ensure distribution across the
country’s mobile networks. 
• In South Africa, News24 is a leading portal with updated
breaking news. It has a dedicated WAP (wireless access
protocol) version for mobile phones. It had more than
500,000 unique visitors to its mobile site in December
2010, up 200 percent over the previous year.18
The emergence of cloud computing and multiple types
of devices (PCs, tablets, mobile handsets) is creating differ-
ent distribution markets. On the one hand, companies like
Apple produce content only for their own brand. Apple’s
iBooks, for example, can be read only on Apple devices.
This approach ties users to the brand because they cannot
use the content they have purchased if they switch brands.
On the other hand, companies like Amazon, which makes
the Kindle ebook reader, sell software applications that
allow Kindle ebooks to be read on multiple platforms.
Similarly, Netflix movie streaming is available across a
number of platforms. As cloud computing invades the
mobile space, it will be possible to run applications
remotely instead of having to purchase and download
them to the device. This development will create more
subscription-like services rather than single downloads.
This is good news for developing nations because it lowers
the cost of applications and content. But to take advantage
of the cloud, users will need good mobile broadband
connectivity. 
Mobile-enabled social and economic
trends
Research shows that mobile networks are having a growing
impact on the economy. One of the earliest and frequently
cited studies on the subject was carried out by three consult-
ants from the Law and Economics Consulting Group. Using
data from 92 countries between 1980 and 2003, they found
that an increase of 10 mobile subscriptions per 100 people
raised GDP growth by 0.6 percent (Waverman, Meschi, and
Fuss 2005). A similar study using data through 2006 found
that a 10 percent increase in mobile penetration in develop-
ing countries was correlated to a 0.8 percent increase in
economic growth (Qiang and Rossotto 2009). Several stud-
ies also find that growth in mobile networks is positively
correlated to foreign direct investment (Lane et al. 2006;
Williams 2005). 
Mounting evidence also shows the microeconomic
impact of mobile in specific countries and industries. The
benefits typically accrue from better access to information
brought about through mobile and are typically related to
lower transactions costs, savings in travel costs and time
spent traveling, better market information, and opportu-
nities to improve one’s livelihood (Jensen 2007; Salahud-
din et al. 2003; Aker 2008; see also tables 1.2 and 2.1 and
box 1.3). 
Mobile for development
As noted by the United Nations Development Programme
“Mobile phones can enhance pro-poor development . . . 
22
Information and Communications for Development 2012

in sectors such as health, education, agriculture, employ-
ment, crisis prevention and the environment . . . that 
are helping to improve human development efforts
around the world” (UNDP 2012). The Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) provide a useful framework
for assessing the development impact of mobile phones.
The MDGs highlight eight priority areas. Examples of the
ways mobile phones are being used to address each of 
the MDGs are given in table 1.2 and throughout this
report.
Overview
23
Table 1.2 Mobile and the Millennium Development Goals
MDG
Example
Poverty and hunger
A study on grain traders in Niger found that cell phones improved consumer welfare (Aker 2008). Access to
cell phones allowed traders to obtain better information about grain prices across the country without incur-
ring the high cost of having to travel to different markets. On average grain traders with cell phones had 29
percent higher profits than those without cell phones. In the Niger example, demand sprang up organically
rather than through a specific program. 
Universal education
According to a survey of teachers in villages in four African countries, one-quarter reported that the use of
mobile phones helped increase student attendance. A main factor was that teachers could contact parents to
enquire about their child’s whereabouts (Puri et al, n.d.). Mobile phones have also been used in Uganda to
track school attendance so that school administrators can see patterns in attendance, for instance by village,
by day of the week, and by season. Tracking attendance for pupils indirectly also tracks absenteeism among
teachers (Twaweza 2010)
Gender equality
A study looking at gender differences in the availability and use of mobile phones in developing countries
reported that 93 percent of the women who had mobiles felt safer because of the phone, 85 percent felt
more independent, and 41 percent had increased income or professional opportunities (GSM Association
2011). The report found that closing the mobile gender gap would increase revenues for mobile operators by
$13 billion.
Child health
A program using text messaging to identify malnutrition among rural children in Malawi is notable for its
impact on the speed and quality of the data flows.a Using a system called RapidSMS, health workers in rural
areas were able to transmit weight and height information in two minutes instead of the two months needed
under the previous system. The data entry error rate was significantly improved to just 2.8 percent from 
14.2 percent in the old system. The improved information flow enabled experts to analyze data more quickly
and accurately, identify children at risk, and provide treatment information to the health staff in the field. 
Maternal health
One of the earliest uses of mobile technology to improve maternal health took place in rural districts of
Uganda in the late 1990s. Traditional birth attendants were provided walkie-talkies, allowing them to stay in
contact with health centers and obtain advice. An assessment of the program found that it led to roughly a 
50 percent reduction in the maternal mortality rate (Musoke 2002).
HIV/AIDS
In Kenya weekly text messages were sent to AIDS patients to remind them to take their antiretroviral drugs
(Lester et al. 2010). Those who received the text messages had significantly higher rates of taking the drugs
than those who did not receive them. The study noted that SMS intervention was less expensive than in-
person community adherence interventions on the basis of travel costs alone and could theoretically translate
into huge health and economic benefits if scaled up.
Environment
According to one forecast, mobile technology could lower greenhouse gas emissions 2 percent by the year
2020 (GSM Association 2009). This reduction can be met through, among other things, widespread adoption
of various mobile-enabled technologies such as smart transportation and logistics, smart grids and meters,
smart buildings, and “dematerialization” (replacing the physical movement of goods and services with online
transmission). Mobile phones can also be used as tools for environmental monitoring. In Ghana, for example,
cab drivers in Accra were outfitted with mobile phones with GPS and a tube containing a carbon monoxide
sensor to test pollution levels.b
Partnership?
MDG target 8F states: “In cooperation with the private sector, make available benefits of new technologies,
especially information and communications.” Mobile phone penetration in low-income economies has grown
from less than one per 100 people in 2000 to almost one per every three by 2010—largely as a result of
private sector investment. Of some 800 telecom projects in developing countries with private sector participa-
tion between 1990 and 2009, almost three-quarters involved greenfield operations primarily in mobile teleph-

Information and Communications for Development 2012
The introduction of
smartphones and light-
weight tablet comput-
ers has revolutionized
the way people access
the 
internet 
from
mobile devices. These
powerful touchscreen
devices have popular-
ized 
downloadable
apps 
that 
can 
do
anything from recog-
nize a song to turn the
device into a flashlight.
Scaled-down versions
of popular office appli-
cations 
for 
word
processing, 
spread-
sheets, and presenta-
tions are available for
smartphones and tablets as well as ebook software. These devices support internet access
over cellular broadband networks and Wi-Fi and often include built-in GPS and still and video
cameras. 
The graphical user interfaces and touchscreens make them ideal for many developing
nations particularly those with non-western alphabets and sizable illiterate populations.
Smartphone and tablet penetration is rising rapidly in urban areas of developing countries. 
Several initiatives are under way that feature low-cost tablets and investigate the feasibility
of devices for rural areas: 
•
In Bangladesh, the Digits to All (DTA) project distributed custom developed tablets (see
screenshot) to over 100 households in a rural village to test their feasibility. The $100
Amadeyr tablet uses the Android operating system with software specifically designed
and customized for use by semiliterate, illiterate, and bottom-of-the-pyramid users. The
tablet uses a touchscreen operated by seeing pictures and hearing instructions given in
Bengali, making it user-friendly for illiterate villagers. The project found that villagers
who had never used PCs, let alone the internet, were able to use the tablets within a
few days and noted: "It is not the rural population who needs to be trained to have
access to information but it is the next generation communication technologies that can
be tailored to meet the local needs and be made easily accessible by rural communities"
(Quadri et al. 2011).
•
India launched its locally manufactured Aakash tablet in October 2011(Tuli 2011). Priced at
around $35 the tablet is aimed for widespread distribution in schools. Apart from its low
cost, the Aakash tablet has other features suitable for the Indian environment including data
compression techniques that lower consumption and hence reduce Internet access
charges. One of the organizations involved in the project forecasts that some 5 million of the
tablets will be shipped in 2012, around half of the equivalent PC figure.

Social networking and democracy
Electronic communication has increasingly become two-
way: examples include participation through feedback in
comments, discussions in forums, and active contribution to
applications such as Wikipedia or Mozilla. In addition, the
tools for users to generate content have been simplified—
not only can most people master text messaging and tweet-
ing but a growing number can also create social networking
pages and blogs. Often driven by youth, participation is
reaching up the age ladder as these tools and their impact
become publicized and popularized. 
The increasing availability of these tools and applications
on mobile phones is enhancing their popularity. Operators
in developing countries are working around the limitations
of low-end handsets that do not have internet capabilities by
providing ways of interacting with social networking appli-
cations through instant messaging, such as MXit in South
Africa.19 Safaricom in Kenya offers special SMS functions
allowing users to send and receive Twitter tweets and to
update their status and send messages to Facebook.20
The diffusion of mobile phones coupled with social
networking creates a new space for citizens around the
globe to engage in political action concerning democracy,
freedom, and human rights. There is disagreement about
the extent to which these tools affect appeals for freedom
and democracy. Some observers argue that social network-
ing tools empower people to defend freedom and that Twit-
ter should be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize (Gladwell
2010). Others argue that, while these applications make it
easier for people to express themselves, it is “harder for that
expression to have any impact.” In other words, applications
like Facebook and Twitter make it possible for large
numbers of people to voice their opinion, but they do so
virtually, and these tools are not substitutes for physical
participation. 
Regardless, recent history has demonstrated that social
media along with messages, videos, and pictures sent from
mobile phones are useful tools for organizing protests and
monitoring democracy and freedom. Examples include:
• One of the first uses of text messaging for social change
took place in the Philippines in January 2001. Political
activists sent SMS text messages urging Filipinos to
assemble at Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in
Manila to demonstrate for the impeachment of then-
president Joseph Estrada. The message, typically
 reforwarded by recipients, read: “Go 2 EDSA. Wear
blk.” During the next few days more than a million
people showed up and some 7 million SMS were sent.
It is argued that this giant outburst concerned legisla-
tors, who allowed evidence in the impeachment trial to
be presented. By January 20 Estrada had resigned,
Overview

•
A project in Tanzania has been familiarizing farmers with smartphones to introduce them to
the features and potential uses (Banks 2011). Although most farmers already had cell
phones, they had never used the internet. The smartphones have been used for geotagging
climate information and to make videos of farmers offering advice on techniques. The infor-
mation is uploaded to the internet to share with other farmers. The visually oriented infor-
mation helped one maize grower to learn from planting mistakes and a few months later he
had his first successful harvest. 
Governments, the private sector, academia, and the development community all have a role
to play in promoting smartphones and tablets for development. Governments in particular can
be encouraged by the potential of these devices to take ICT for development to another level
through easy-to-use graphical interfaces with Internet connectivity over wireless networks.
Just as the One Laptop per Child program helped trigger a reduction in low-end computers, a
“One Smartphone/Tablet per Citizen” initiative could help generate mass availability.

blaming his exit on the “the text-messaging genera-
tion” (Shirky 2011).
• Thousands of Moldovans demonstrated against the
government in the spring of 2009. It was dubbed the
“Twitter Revolution,” because that application was a main
method used to organize the demonstrators. One of
Twitter’s “Trending Topics” at the time was the tag
“#pman” an abbreviation for Piata Marii Adunari
Nationale, the main square in downtown Chisinau, the
nation’s capital and location of the demonstrations.
Protestors used the local mobile data network to post
tweets from their mobile phones (Morozov 2009). 
• In Côte d’Ivoire a so-called “web mash-up” site called
Wonzomai (“sentential” in the Ivorian Bété dialect) was
created to monitor the 2010 presidential election. Users
were provided with telephone number short codes to
which they could send free SMS and tweets to report
abnormalities that they had witnessed during and imme-
diately after the election. The reports were visualized on a
website, which showed the locations where incidents had
taken place as well as trends plotted over the duration of
the election.21
In the Middle East, mobile has unsettled the region’s
social and political traditions since the mid-2000s (Ibahrine
2009). Its greatest impact to date may have come between
2010 and 2012 when social media played a role in the “Arab
Spring” uprisings in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, the Syrian Arab
Republic, Tunisia, the Republic of Yemen, and other coun-
tries in the region. As one Egyptian protestor put it: “We use
Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and
YouTube to tell the world.”22 Surges in social networking and
demonstrations in these countries appear to be connected.
All but one demonstration reportedly took place following
the initial call to protest on a Facebook page (figure 1.8). The
number of Facebook users in these countries also grew
significantly during the demonstrations. 
Similarly, Twitter use increased during the Arab Spring.
The #jan25 tag, created to organize the first big protest in
Egypt falling on that day, remained in active use for several
weeks afterward and tag accounted for a majority of Twitter
traffic in Egypt through the resignation of President Hosni
Mubarak on February 11, 2011. Although there were only
around 130,000 active tweeters in Egypt at the time, the
#jan25 tag had over 1.2 million mentions, illustrating the
viral effect of social networking where a tweet can be
retweeted by many other users. The day Mubarak left office,
the number of tweets in Egypt reached its zenith at 35,000.
During a five-day internet blackout, tweets were sent using
proxy servers or through contacts in other countries (Zirul-
nick 2011). 
It is difficult to pinpoint the exact role mobile played in
the uprisings because social networking applications can
also be used on PCs. In most of the non-Gulf Arab nations,
however, mobile ownership far outnumbers computer
possession (figure 1.9a). Further the portability and ease of
concealment of mobiles are ideally suited to street protests.
In addition, camera phones are well integrated with mobile
social networking applications, making it relatively simple to
record and dispatch images and videos over the high-speed
wireless networks available in most Arab nations. In Egypt,
almost 60 percent of mobile owners use their phone to take
photos or video (figure 1.9b). About 1,000 videos were sent

Although governments can try to restrict access to the
internet and mobile networks, they may pay a heavy price.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment (OECD 2011) estimated that the direct costs to the
Egyptian government of shutting down the internet and
mobile phone networks during demonstrations was 
$18 million a day, with a much wider economic impact when
factoring in industries such as eCommerce, tourism, and busi-
ness process outsourcing. Restricting access also tends to have
a reverse effect: according to a survey of Egyptian and
Tunisian citizens, blocking networks causes “people to be more
active, [and] decisive and to find ways to be more creative
about communicating and organizing even more” (Dubai
School of Government 2011). Short of a complete shutdown,
users can find workarounds to blocked applications by using
proxies; if close enough, they can also pick up cellular signals
from neighboring countries. Intriguingly, some of the coun-
tries identified as having the heaviest internet restrictions were
also those where social-media-driven demonstrations have
taken place (Reporters Without Borders 2009).
Structure of the report
The rest of this report explores these themes in more detail.
The report distills work carried out by the World Bank
Group and its development partners since the last edition of
this report, in 2009, with a particular focus on mobile appli-
cations for development. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 have a sectoral
focus on the use of mobile applications in agriculture and
rural development, health, and financial services respec-
tively. Chapters 5 and 6 are cross-cutting, looking at how
mobile communications are contributing to entrepreneur-
ship and employment and how they are being used to bring
citizens and government closer together. Finally, chapter 7
looks at the shift from narrowband to broadband mobile
networks and the policy implications involved. The Statisti-
cal Appendix provides an overview of recent trends in the
mobile sector and introduces a new analytical tool. The
Country Tables at the end of the report provide an at-a-
glance view of the status of mobile communications in
World Bank member countries.

n many developing countries the agricultural sector
plays a significant role in the national economy. The
sector employs about 40 percent of the total labor force
in countries with annual per capita incomes ranging from
$400 to $1,800 (World Bank 2008). Developing countries
will continue to rely heavily on the agricultural sector to
ensure employment for the rural poor and food security for
growing populations as well as to meet challenges brought
on by climate change and spikes in global food prices.
Improving efficiencies in the agricultural value chain is
central to addressing these challenges. Increasing productiv-
ity in agriculture is also critical to reducing poverty. Greater
productivity can boost farmers’ income, especially for small-
holder farmers and fishers, who have limited resources to
leverage in growing and marketing their produce. Creating a
more efficient value chain also requires engaging many
stakeholders, from farmers growing crops and raising cattle
to input suppliers to distributors. 
The potential benefits of using mobile phones to connect
these diverse stakeholders along the agricultural value chain
speak for themselves. For rural populations, geographically
dispersed and isolated from knowledge centers, the informa-
tion and communication capabilities of the mobile phone
can be even more valuable. Close to 6 billion phones are in
use today and are accessible to the 70 percent or so of the
world’s poor whose main source of income and employment
comes from the agricultural sector (World Bank 2012). 
The mobile revolution in agriculture is not driven by
mobile phones alone. Other mobile devices such as smart-
phones and tablets have already begun to have an impact as
information delivery channels. These devices can carry
applications that are much more sophisticated than those
available in the basic mobile phone. As the cost of these
devices declines, they will increasingly be adopted in devel-
oping contexts.
This chapter examines how services provided on mobile
phones and other mobile devices have begun to change the
way stakeholders across the agricultural value chain make
decisions regarding inputs, production, marketing, process-
ing, and distribution—decisions that can potentially lead to
greater efficiencies, reduced transaction costs, and increased
incomes. The chapter also examines the key challenges
mobile service providers are facing in scaling up their oper-
ations to reach critical mass and to ensure sustainability for
the development of a whole ecosystem of different stake-
holders. Based on this analysis, the chapter concludes by
drawing key policy considerations.
Making information mobile
Among the numerous technological developments in the
information and communication technology (ICT) sector,
mobile phones have had the most pronounced impact in
developing countries. As detailed in chapter 1, adoption has
Chapter 2
Mobilizing the Agricultural Value Chain

been driven by improved accessibility and affordability
made possible through the expansion of mobile networks
that are cheaper to deploy than fiber-optic cable infrastruc-
ture. The capacity or bandwidth available on mobile
networks continues to increase as the technology evolves,
enabling more data-intensive services to be delivered
through sophisticated devices such as smartphones and
tablets. 
The most common device in developing countries is still
the basic mobile phone, and hence most of the examples
cited in this chapter are for mobile services provided
through the text-based SMS (short message service) (see
table 1.1). An SMS of up to 160 characters can be sent from
one phone to another. SMS messages can be used to
communicate, inform, and share knowledge on various
aspects of agricultural and rural life. The SMS function is
generally bundled into the price of a subscription or prepaid
package; in many, but not all, developing countries, SMS
costs a small fraction of the price of a voice call and can be
sent asynchronously, that is, without the caller and the called
party having to be online at the same time. Messages sent
using USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data)
have a functionality similar to instant messaging and can be
used when both parties are online, for instance, to access
information from a database; USSD messages are sometimes
cheaper than SMS messages.
As prices continue to decline, data-enabled devices such as
feature phones, smartphones, and tablet computers are
expected to become more accessible to more people. These
devices include an operating system, which means they have
computing capabilities and can carry software applications,
referred to as mobile applications. In the past year tablet
computers have started to revolutionize various entertainment
and knowledge-based industries such as music, videos, books,
newspapers, and magazines. Combining the operational
potential of a computer, the communications capabilities of a
phone, and the versatility of a notepad, companies have already
started selling no-frills tablets for less than the cost of some
mobile phones ($50–$150). 
These data-enabled devices, along with their increasing
affordability, can have a range of implications for the devel-
opment of mobile applications, including ease of use, richer
multimedia that can transform agricultural extension ser -
vices, and the ability to access relevant information on
demand in local languages. While cost may still be a barrier
for smallholder farmers,1 community knowledge workers,
and local entrepreneurs, users are increasingly able to afford
these mobile devices, incorporating them in their work to
collect and disseminate information. Devices targeted for this
market increasingly use offline technology such as USB
(universal serial bus) media to overcome connectivity issues.2
Mobile and remote wireless sensors and identification
technologies also have an important role to play in gathering
data and information relevant to agricultural production,
such as temperature, soil composition, and water levels.
Illustrative examples of emerging uses of these non-cellular
technologies in developing countries are given throughout
this chapter. 
Increasingly, specialized mobile services targeted to
specific agricultural functions are becoming more available
(table 2.1). The basic functions of a mobile phone—sending
and receiving voice calls and text messages—are invaluable
in increasing efficiency in smallholder agriculture by
improving the flow of information along and between

 various stakeholders in the value chain from producer to
processor to wholesaler to retailer to consumer. Furthermore,
mobile phones also enable smallholder farmers to close the
feedback loop by sending information to markets, not just
consuming information from markets.
Improved access to agricultural
information
The expansion of mobile networks provides a unique and
unparalleled opportunity to give rural smallholders access to
information that could transform their livelihoods. This
section explores the role of mobile applications in mitigating
some of the informational costs that producers in develop-
ing countries face in obtaining better yields, increasing their
income, and managing uncertainty. The most common uses
of SMS and USSD in the context of agriculture include
access to price information, disease and meteorological
information, and information on growing and marketing
practices (extension services).
Price information
The prevailing market price signals the aggregated
demand and value on any given day and fluctuates over
time. Before the expansion of mobile networks, agricul-
tural producers were often unaware of these prices and
had to rely on information from traders and agents to
determine whether, when, where, or for how much to sell
their crops. Delays in obtaining this data or misinterpreta-
tion of second-hand pricing information has serious
consequences for agricultural producers, who may end up
underselling their products, delivering too little or too
much of the product, or having their products wither
away. Further, reliance on traders or agents creates rent-
seeking opportunities, adding to the agricultural workers’
cost of business. 
This “information asymmetry” often results in price
dispersion—drastically different prices for the same prod-
ucts in markets only short distances apart—and thus lost
income for some farmers and higher prices for consumers.
Numerous studies have shown the benefits of ICT in
promoting access to price information, including increases
of up to 24 percent in incomes for farmers and up to 57
percent for traders and price reductions of around 4 percent
for consumers depending on the crop, country, and year of
study (table 2.2).
A study (Aker 2010) conducted in Niger from 2001 to
2006 found that the introduction of mobile phones had
reduced grain price dispersion by 6.4 percent and reduced
price variation by 12 percent over the course of one year.
Further, the study notes that the impact (or benefits) of
mobile phones tends to be greater in markets that are more
remote. Pricing for the agricultural sector requires village-
level information and generating relevant localized informa-
tion can be costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, and to improve local livelihoods, Grameen AppLab
in Uganda and Reuters Market Light in India (box 2.1) have
collaborated with the government agencies and nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs) to employ farmers and exten-
sion service providers to collect information.
Feature-enabled phones with camera and GPS (global
positioning system), and smartphones have already begun to
emerge in rural areas, where they are being used by field
workers responsible for collecting data. At volume, the cost
of data can be much cheaper than SMS in some countries.
For example, through the Grameen Foundation’s partner-
ship with a telecommunications operator in Uganda, data is
dramatically less expensive than SMS for the volumes their
Community Knowledge Workers use. A worker can earn $20
a month from disseminating and collecting information and
another $20–$30 from charging farmers’ phones from their
solar charger. 
Disease and meteorological information 
Disease and meteorological information is also required by
farmers on a frequent basis. Without such information,
farmers may be unable to use timely measures to stem losses
from climate shocks and poor yields caused by crop diseases.
Mobile phones can serve as the backbone for early warning
systems to mitigate these risks and safeguard incomes. 
For example, a publicly funded pilot project in Turkey
provides locally relevant information to farmers in Kasta-
monu province, where producers maintain orchards
susceptible to frost and pests (Donovan 2011). Initially,
nationally aggregated weather data collected in urban areas
was used but proved to be inaccurate and of limited use to
farmers in the provinces, because of differing microclimates
from farm to farm in temperature, humidity, precipitation,
and soil fertility. Five small meteorological stations and 
14 small reference farms were then established to collect
data on these variables, enabling accurate pest monitoring.
Given the wide use of mobile phones with SMS capability,

the project supplies timely information so that producers
can apply pesticides as and when needed, resulting in lower
production costs and improved crop yields. Savings
amounted to about $2 a tree, with overall savings estimated
to be as much as $1 million a year. Considering the cost
required to set up this service (around $40,000), this project
may be viewed as a success. 
Information on growing and marketing practices
Information shortfalls exist in many areas throughout the
agricultural production cycle. Whether for growing crops,
fishing, or raising livestock, the producer must make deci-
sions on cultivating certain crops or livestock, crop inputs,
pest management, harvest, postharvest, marketing, and
sale. 

Farming organizations and cooperatives provide farmers
with a broad range of information, as well as institutional
links to large-scale suppliers and distributors. These organi-
zations give farmers a collective voice and more visibility in
the agricultural value chain. Many of these organizations
started out by providing information and services through
leaflets, radio, and internet sites, but they are increasingly
using the mobile platform to provide tailored information to
farmers (box 2.2). These organizations are being used to
supplement and support existing face-to-face trainings for
farmers and livestock owners.
Smallholder farms are often disadvantaged compared
with larger enterprises because of their inability to leverage
economies of scale in procuring inputs, marketing their
goods, and sharing machinery and knowledge. Successful
agricultural cooperatives and farmer groups have solved
this problem by enabling small farmers to pool their
resources and improve their bargaining power vis-à-vis
Mobilizing the Agricultural Value Chain

An international news giant launched Reuters Market Light (RML) in 2007 to provide market
prices and weather and crop advisory services to farmers in India. Invented by a Reuters
employee, this service offers highly customizable market information to farmers through text
messages delivered to mobile phones. 
To subscribe, farmers call a toll-free number to activate the service in the local language and
specify the crops and markets in which they have an interest. Farmers receive four to five
SMS alerts with relevant information each day. Initial studies show that farmers who receive
the service typically gain 5–10 percent more income. 
RML is one of India’s largest market information services, serving 250,000 customers
across tens of thousands of villages. It delivers customized information to India’s farming
sector covering over 250 crops, 1,000 markets, and 3,000 weather locations across 13 Indian
states in 8 local languages. 
The company employs over 300 office staff in eight states to process localized agricultural
information. The teams, organized according to content type, scour media sources for agri-
cultural news (including market prices, pest and disease reports, government programs,
weather reports, and local news). This information is sorted by geography and sent to the
appropriate subscribers. RML’s growth shows that embracing a wide network of people—
including, in this case, price collectors, agricultural institutes, and other information
providers—is a vital success factor for mobile applications ecosystems. 
Such detailed processing can involve large sunk costs with relatively high monthly operat-
ing costs of $4 a customer. There is a trade-off between the provision of local information and
scalability. Local teams are needed to collect data, and expansion into new areas may involve
additional content provision costs, limiting economies of scale. Costs therefore climb in paral-
lel with new subscribers. Because it relies solely on income from this single service, RML’s
market remains relatively small and is not yet profitable.
RML has sought to reach as many customers as possible through a number of strategies,
including sales offices in postal offices, local shops, input suppliers, and banks. Customers
obtain RML through basic SMS using prepaid scratch cards that give access to the service for
a given amount of time. 
RML competes with traditional information services (radio, market intermediaries, news-
papers) and other services that use mobile phones. IFFCO Kisan Sanchar Limited (IKSL) offers
similar market information for rural farmers but uses voice messages so illiterate farmers can
use the service. Achieving economies of scale is essential for profitability. In 2009 RML report-
edly crossed the $1 million sales mark.

Box 2.1 How Reuters Market Light generates hyperlocalized information 

large producers and traders. Cooperatives can also be ideal
networks to launch and manage mobile information serv-
ices, because they can provide highly relevant and localized
information, and drive farmer adoption through existing
social networks. Coopeumo, a Chilean farming cooperative
with fewer than 400 members, uses text messages to help
small-scale farmers increase productivity. Through the
Mobile Information Project (MIP), nearly 200 farmers
receive daily messages including market prices and weather
forecasts directly from the internet to their mobile phones.
The MIP provides two different services—DatAgro and Yo
Agricultor. DatAgro provides targeted weather updates that
are particularly useful to farmers at critical points such as
planting and harvest. Yo Agricultor is a sophisticated web
portal for farmers supported by the Chilean government
that uses MIP to send messages to further its outreach to
groups that have more limited internet access. The MIP
software works on the basic phones (costing around
$15–$20) that farmers tend to use and is effective over slow
networks.
While many farmer groups have seen success in forming
long-standing cooperatives in Latin America, such coopera-
tives are less prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Organizations
serving them, and companies operating in the value chain,
thus face different needs and opportunities. In areas where
farmers are less networked, the interventions may need to be
more robust—building up social networks to reach the
poorest—and to ensure the information is relevant and
actionable in order to drive farmer adoption of new tech-
nology services. 
A recent addition to the kind of information available
to farmers is digital images of agricultural land. The
Seeing Is Believing West Africa (SIBWA) project—started
by scientists at the ICRISAT (International Crops Research
Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics)—involves local exten-
sion service providers and farmers in Burkina Faso,
Ghana, Mali, and Niger, who interpret information from
very high resolution imagery (VHRI) taken from satellites.
The images are used to gauge the relative fertility of the
soil (through light reflectivity) and to measure the size and
shape of fields. Many farmers may not know the precise
size of their land, so the SIBWA team works with the farm-
ers to determine the optimal amounts of fertilizer, pesti-
cide, and seeds needed to cover their land evenly. Knowing
the size and shape of fields can help rural communities
plan for future developments, including investments in
irrigation, for example. The SIBWA team also worked with
local NGOs with expertise in specialized technologies and
extension services to complement their efforts (Deloitte
2012).

The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka discovered that
between 2003 and 2008, more than half of the country’s 560,000 milk cows were not in fact
pregnant at any given time, resulting in a loss of 30–35 days’ worth of milk. Low pregnancy
rates resulted from a lack of timely access to artificial insemination and breeding services. The
eDairy program was introduced in 2009 to enable farmers to request veterinary and extension
services (related to issues such as animal health, artificial insemination, milk prices, and
construction of dairy stalls) through a simple SMS interface or on touchscreen tablets. Farm-
ers type in their personal identification code and the code of the service they need. The
request is then sent to all registered suppliers, so they can contact the farmers directly. Farm-
ers usually obtain feedback within a few hours. So far, 300 farmers have registered for the
service. According to Sri Lanka’s Department of Dairy Foods, milk production could be
increased by 30 percent if artificial insemination services were requested and supplied in a
timely manner. Moreover, the ICTA estimates that farmers could earn an additional $262 per
calf each year.

Improving data visibility for 
value-chain efficiency
In addition to improved information services for producers,
mobile services can also enable better access to markets and
other value-chain stakeholders such as traders, input suppli-
ers, and end users. Mobiles can help agribusiness companies
and wholesale buyers connect with geographically dispersed
producers. This section explores how mobiles and mobile
applications create value in the value chain by linking
producers to distributors and retailers through better
record-keeping and traceability.
Improving logistics
Transporting produce requires coordination between
producers, truckers, and, at times, warehouse owners and
aggregate traders. Many producers, especially in remote and
rural areas, must carry their produce themselves, often by
foot, to the nearest collection point. Coordinating trans-
portation is also key to larger traders who aggregate produce
for sale in urban areas or for export. Studies show that so far
traders are using their websites to relay information on
transport and logistics. Some of these services, however,
could also be provided on a mobile phone.
The Zambia National Farmers Union operates an SMS-
based information service that provides information on
commodity prices to farmers. To complement the service,
the union has also launched an electronic transport system
that allows registered transporters to publicize the arrival
and delivery times of loads or cargo.3 They have three main
services, one through which producers can publicize the size
of their load and where it is located for pickup, the second
for transporters on the way back from the market with an
empty truck that could potentially be used to haul products
from the market to the village, and the third a directory of
transporters that allows producers to contact a transporter
directly. This service is being provided through a website in
Zambia, but in Morocco, a similar service is using mobile
phones. Through the use of voice and SMS, farmers coordi-
nated with local truckers to improve product transport and
identify where to deliver their products. Some farmers devel-
oped a two-way trade, bringing products back from the
market to sell in their own rural communities (Dixie and
Jayaraman 2011).
Another example is M-Farm Ltd,4 an agribusiness
company established by a group of women developers, that
emerged from the IPO48 competition, a 48-hour boot-camp
event aimed at giving mobile and web developers a platform
to launch their applications. Besides the staple text-based
service for obtaining price information, M-Farm enables
suppliers to publicize information on special offers to farm-
ers. This format follows a global trend in deal-of-the-day
websites that feature discounted offers at local retailers, such
as the Groupon service in the United States. 
Tracing products from farm gate to market
The growing globalized and interdependent nature of food
production and distribution, combined with raised aware-
ness of food-borne diseases, has shed light on the need to
ensure food safety in the global food supply chain.5 These
trends have catalyzed effective technological innovation to
trace the food supply from point of origin to the consumer
(Karippacheril, Rios, and Srivastava 2011) 
The International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) defines traceability as the ability to trace the history
or location of the item or product under consideration.
Traceability is therefore a common element of both public
and private systems for monitoring compliance (with regu-
lations on quality environmental, or other product or
process attributes related to food). Traceability is becoming
increasingly relevant to developing countries that want to
gain or expand into new export markets. Smallholder
farms, which often lack resources to keep up with strict and
changing food safety standards on their own, are now
increasingly turning to cooperatives and aggregators who
are leveraging ICTs to improve traceability. By opening up
new specialized market opportunities, the use of ICTs has
led to improved consumer protection and food safety on
the one hand, and better livelihood outcomes for farmers
on the other (box 2.3).
For this challenge, radio frequency identification (RFID)
chips are emerging as a solution for traceability. Placed on a
crate of apples or in the ear of a cow, the chip can collect data
such as motion, temperature, spoilage, density, light, and
other environmental variables though an interface with
wireless sensor networks. Traceability systems for bulk prod-
ucts have been implemented in developing countries, even
among small farmers. 
Representing more than 500,000 small farmers, the
National Coffee Growers association in Colombia has
leveraged RFID technology to improve traceability and
recordkeeping on coffee quality standards. At a cost of

$0.25 a tag, encased wear-resistant tags with unique farm
identification numbers are distributed to farmers. These
tags are read at each step to market, thus helping to main-
tain the stringent standards required for this high-value
specialty coffee.6
RFID chips are also commonly used to trace animal
movements, enabling the monitoring of animals from cradle
to grave. The Namibian Livestock Identification and Trace-
ability System (NamLITS) (Collins 2004), implemented in
2005, focuses on nurturing livestock production for export
markets. More than 85 percent of agricultural land in
Namibia is used to raise livestock, and beef production
constitutes 87 percent of agricultural revenue. The objective
of NamLITS is to implement a traceability system to help in
the control, risk management, and eradication of bovine
diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease. The use of RFIDs
to replace traditional paper-based recording, has increased
the accuracy of the data and the speed with which it is
disseminated. It has also contributed to a more vigorous
market: the Namibian livestock market increased approxi-
mately $83 million in 2010 (Deloitte 2012). 
Mali is a landlocked country with 80 percent of employ-
ment in subsistence agriculture and fishing. In the 1990s the
government identified mangoes as having potential for
diversifying the country’s exports. It faced a number of chal-
lenges, however, including meeting increasingly stringent
criteria regarding the origin of products, the way they are
grown, the fertilizers and pesticides used, and how they are
38

Lack of traceability during the growing and procurement process is a major constraint for
producers growing for high-value export markets, such as specialty coffee. For the coopera-
tives and companies that manage the exports, emerging mobile technology—smartphones
and tablets—can play a major role in capturing, tracking, and accessing valuable information
from growing practices to crop quality.
Sustainable Harvest is a coffee importer that works with 200,000 farmers in Latin America
and East Africa. Extending its relationship-based procurement model to the digital platform,
the organization and its farmer training offices have introduced a new coffee traceability
program—called the Relationship Information Tracking System, or RITS—to help coffee grow-
ers become more efficient, reliable, and quality-focused through a new mobile or tablet-based
information tracking system. 
RITS provides farmer cooperatives with the ability to trace each step of the value chain.
Using a cloud-based application, the cooperative managers can record deliveries of coffee
from each member including details of coffee varieties and quality scores for each lot of coffee
received. The application also tracks the certification status of each delivery, processes farmer
payment, and generates reports on farmer productivity, payments, and samples.
Roaster clients can access videos, photos, quality, and lot information from their supplier
cooperatives. The application has been designed for Apple’s iPad and iPhone, but it can be
used in any smartphone through the web browser. Devices with large touchscreens allow for
easier input of a large variety of information. The application can record information offline, and
then upload to the online database when connectivity is restored.
In 2011 Sustainable Harvest also launched RITS Ed, an iPad app that delivers agricultural
training videos on organic coffee production and quality control that co-op managers can use
to assist their members. Sustainable Harvest also plans to expedite the application process for
third-party certification (organic, for example) through the launch of a new module, RITS
Metrics, that will enable more robust, and customizable reports. 
RITS is currently testing the program with two cooperatives in Peru with 500 members and
one cooperative in East Africa with 1,840 members.

packed. With the support of donors and NGOs, Fruit et
Legumes du Mali (Fruilema), an association representing
790 small producers and five exporting companies, launched
a web- and mobile-enabled platform through which poten-
tial buyers can track and monitor their mangoes (Annerose
2010). The consumer can type the number shown on a tag
attached to the fruit into a website to get the exact details of
where the mango came from, its producer, and the methods
used to cultivate the mango. To leverage the mobile phone
platform, Fruilema partnered with a Senegalese mobile
operator, Manobi, to pay farmers an additional 9 cents a
pound when they entered data on their produce on the
Manobi website. One of the key challenges Fruilema faces is
to make sure farmers send in all the necessary information
to meet the criteria for exporting (Deloitte 2012). 
Enhancing access to markets 
Mobile phones, although owned and used by individuals,
can nevertheless have an important impact in linking
markets and key stages of the value chain. A recent study of
farmers conducted in Bangladesh, China, India, and
 Vietnam found that 80 percent of farmers in these countries
owned a mobile phone and used them to connect with
agents and traders to estimate market demand and the sell-
ing price (Minten, Reardon, and Chen n.d.). More than 
50 percent of these farmers would make arrangements for
sale over the phone. Another study (Muto and Yamano 2009)
found that as remote communities in Uganda were provided
with access to a mobile network, the share of bananas sold
rose from 50 to 69 percent of the crop. This effect, however,
was not observed for maize, which is a less perishable crop. 
Improved understanding of real-time market dynamics
can help farmers deal with external demand, such as switch-
ing to high-demand but riskier (perishable) products (Sen
and Choudhary 2011). Risky products include crops that are
easily ruined if the rainy season arrives too early, for exam-
ple. The growing sophistication and knowledge of value
chains also means that farmers can work directly with larger
intermediaries, capturing more of the product’s value.
Farmers are able to expand their networks and establish
contacts directly with other buyers in other areas (Shaffril et
al. 2009). Aside from the overall impact of mobile phones on
marketing and market linkages, certain mobile applications
can help aggregate information between buyers and sellers
(box 2.4).
As mobile service and applications providers in agricul-
ture become more knowledgeable about the needs of the
farmers as well as their behavior, they are developing
increasingly sophisticated applications. In 2000 ITC (Indian
Tobacco Company), a large conglomerate in India, broke
new ground by establishing e-Choupal—kiosks with
computers—in rural villages, where farmers are able to
access price, planting, and weather information. Since then,
the company has been working to provide its services over
mobile phones. ITC has been piloting a new virtual
Mobilizing the Agricultural Value Chain
39
More than two-thirds of Africans rely on agriculture for a living, yet because of the lack of
complete information, high transaction costs, and inefficient value chains, farmers, intermedi-
aries, and buyers are unable to effectively collaborate in the fragmented market. Pride Africa’s
DrumNet project is an integrated platform that uses various ICTs, including mobile phones, to
provide producers, traders, and financial service providers with an end-to-end solution to
procuring inputs, linking to buyers, and finalizing credit and payments. 
Starting with fast-growing horticulture and oilseed industries in Kenya, DrumNet ran a
series of pilots that delivered services to agro-buyers, banks, farm input retailers, and farmers.
The pilots were implemented in five different Kenyan provinces and are reported to have
involved over 4,000 small-scale farmers. 
Before farmers plant crops, DrumNet’s network of entrepreneurs negotiates contractual
arrangements between buyers and farmers. These agreements allow farmers to access credit

commodity exchange, Tradersnet, that enables the direct
purchase and sale of coffee by producers and wholesale
purchasers over an internet-based trading platform. SMS
messages are sent to users’ mobile phones every morning
with the offers and grades available for purchase on that day.
At the end of the day, users receive a text message with details
of what actually took place (Vodafone 2009).
In Ghana, TradeNet established Esoko to serve as a
central repository of price information to be run by a
centralized agency such as the government. The people
who set up Esoko soon realized that the agricultural sector
consists of many decentralized markets where a single
price cannot suffice. Therefore, Esoko became a mobile
and web-enabled repository of current market prices and
a platform to enable buyers and sellers to make offers and
connect to one another. Using a bronze/silver/gold/plat-
inum subscription model, Esoko has also been able to
offer differentiated service to a diverse customer base. In a
recent study of 600 smallholder farmers in northern
Ghana, the French National Institute for National
Research (INRA) found that farmers have seen a 10
percent revenue increase since they began receiving and
using Esoko SMS market prices (Egyir, al-Hassan, and
Abakah 2010).7

from partner institutions such as Equity Bank and to purchase inputs from certified retailers.
At harvest, DrumNet franchise representatives coordinate produce aggregation, grading, and
transportation through agreements with local field agents and transporters. DrumNet tracks
and facilitates the entire process through the use of complimentary manual and SMS
 applications. 
Benefits to the stakeholders include:
•
Farmers reduce transaction costs by accessing both credit and markets through DrumNet
and are able to pay off their loans with their farm produce proceeds. Farmer income is
reported to have risen by an average of 32 percent.
•
Large-scale buyers are freed from the requirement of managing cumbersome transactions
to ensure reliable supplies of produce from multiple smallholders.
•
Input sellers can access new customers without having to sell products on credit.
•
Banks and microfinancial institutions are able to tap into a currently inaccessible market for
savings and credit while avoiding high transaction costs.
The process creates an enabling environment for agricultural finance in a number of ways:
•
Banks are assured at the time of lending that farmers have a market for their produce and
the means to adequately serve that market, which indicates a healthy revenue stream.
•
Banks offer in-kind credit to farmers for inputs. 
•
Cashless payment transfers reduce strategic default, since farmers cannot obtain revenue
until their outstanding loans are fully paid.
The DrumNet project employs tested value-chain approaches to promote agricultural lend-
ing. Its operating cost of about $6.80 a user is high, and DrumNet is facing difficulties because
it has not yet reached a critical mass that would allow it to stand alone without donor funding.
Farmers’ inability to attain sufficient crop yields, because of irregular and insufficient rain and
other factors, has also threatened the success of the project.

Box 2.4 (continued)

Policy considerations
The examples provided in this chapter demonstrate that
food producers and intermediaries are already able to do
more with their mobile phones to raise farm incomes and
the efficiency of the value chain. Governments have a role to
play in ensuring that innovation in this area continues. An
enabling environment for mobile services, applications, and
other devices, such as RFIDs and remote sensors, includes
three support pillars:
• Business models. Many of the services described in this
chapter rely on public funding and are in pilot stages.
DrumNet and RML, while they provide robust business
models, are still figuring out how to address high per-user
costs, by either scaling up or adding new services to
increase the number of subscribers. Public funding,
applied through pull mechanisms and results-based
financial incentives such as challenge funds, can provide
grants and soft loans to innovators who are experiment-
ing with new technologies and business models until they
can become financially viable. The public sector can also
innovate in its own agricultural programs to create more
client-oriented information and knowledge services that
leverage mobile technology. Finally, governments can
play a catalytic role in facilitating collaboration and
dialogue between various private sector players, public
sector service providers, and academia and knowledge
centers. 
• ICT skills. Information needs in developing countries are
highly localized; therefore, nurturing a domestic ICT
skills base in the workforce is crucial to the development
of mobile applications and services in the agricultural
space. Several of the examples cited in this chapter are
from India and Kenya, where the strong presence of
skilled software professionals and entrepreneurs has
significantly helped these countries lead in producing
relevant and high-quality development-focused applica-
tion services. Governments have a critical role to play in
ensuring that the education curricula at the secondary,
tertiary, and vocational levels properly reflect the needs of
the emerging digital economy. In addition to the pull-
based mechanisms and challenge funds described above,
technology hubs and technology incubation programs
can have a crucial role in encouraging entrepreneurship
and emergence of an industry in this space. 
• Supporting infrastructure. To make the more powerful
mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, more
accessible and affordable, governments will need to
ensure that the private sector is capable of offering
mobile broadband services at affordable prices. That
requires an enabling environment where competition
between telecommunications providers is robust.
In addition to supporting the emergence and growth of
the mobile services industry, governments could also benefit
from the data generated through mobile phone networks
and remote sensors. For example, information on price,
weather, and diseases could potentially be aggregated so that
research institutions and relevant government agencies can
analyze and monitor trends. The highly relevant and up-to-
date information generated from this type of analysis can
inform higher-level policy dialogue on topics such as
commodity pricing, subsidy effectiveness, climate change,
and trade. Further, by disclosing the aggregated data and
analysis to the public, people who initially provided the data,
such as farmers, input suppliers, and distributors, would
benefit from the analysis—an important component of the
Open Data Initiative that many developing countries are
implementing.
Conclusions
As information becomes more accessible through the use of
mobile devices for stakeholders throughout the agriculture
value chain, people are gradually moving toward more effi-
cient ways of producing agricultural products, increasing
incomes, and capturing more value by linking fragmented
markets. Key benefits include increases in productivity and
income for farmers and efficiency improvements in aggre-
gating and transporting products. Although elements of the
mobile agriculture platform are emerging in developing
countries, the full potential has yet to be realized. The mobile
services cited here are simply tools, and without the proper
supporting pillars such as those described above, the key
challenges that hamper their sustainability will be difficult to
overcome.
Looking forward, governments will need to examine their
role in creating an enabling environment for innovators seek-
ing ways to meet the needs of this information-intensive
sector. Specific ICT strategies for the agriculture sector would
help guide both the public and private sector in creating this
Mobilizing the Agricultural Value Chain
41

enabling environment. These policies should take into
account the need for new business models in specific country
contexts and facilitate inputs such as the supporting infra-
structure (broadband services) and the IT industry (IT skills).
Technologists, governments, NGOs, private businesses, and
donor agencies are just starting to work together to leverage
mobile technologies for greater inclusion of rural and poor
communities into their spheres of activity.
Notes
1. The definition of smallholder varies across countries and
regions but generally refers to farmers with limited volumes of
yield and low or uncertain income. According to the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO 2004), smallholder farmers
often cultivate less than one hectare of land in favorable areas,
whereas they may cultivate 10 hectares or more in semi-arid
areas, or manage 10 head of livestock.

alling a doctor is a natural response to getting sick
in most of the developed world, but that is not
always an option in many developing countries.
The spread of mobile phones in developing nations promises
to change that, however, by enabling health professionals to
speak directly with their patients, to arrange health care 
services such as appointments, and to monitor symptoms. 
This chapter is concerned with what happens once
basic communications are widely available. How can
mobile devices be used to enhance health care? How can
mobile devices improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
health care interactions between patients and immediate
health care providers (such as doctors and hospitals), as
well as between patients, providers, and other institutions
involved with health (such as health information portals,
insurance companies, and government agencies)?
Early on, the term mHealth was narrowly defined to
mean wireless telemedicine involving the use of mobile
telecommunications and multimedia technologies and their
integration with mobile health care delivery systems
(Istepanian and Lacal 2003).1 However, this definition does
not do justice to the wide variety of stakeholders and types
of uses that mHealth spans today. In this report, a broader
definition is adopted: “mHealth encompasses any use of
mobile technology to address health care challenges such as
access, quality, affordability, matching of resources, and
behavioral norms [through] the exchange of information”
(Qiang et al. 2012). It is a dynamic field for innovative new
services that move health care away from pure public service
delivery toward seeing the patient as a consumer. Mobile
health software and services have proved to be versatile tools
for collecting data at the point of action, potentially result-
ing in more accountable management of information in
health care delivery, increasingly going beyond telemedi-
cine.2 Table 3.1 summarizes some of the more important
mHealth categories.
Why mHealth? Opportunities and
challenges
How can mobile communications help to achieve public and
private health sector objectives, and what policies can help
facilitate mHealth deployments? On the supply side, mobile
communications can help provide health care services more
quickly and cheaply in many cases, mainly by focusing on
primary, preventive, and self-empowered approaches to
health care. From the demand perspective, mobile phones
can make it easier and more convenient not only to find rele-
vant information quickly but also to enter health data and
engage in interactive services, such as symptom tracking and
online communities of patients. 
For mHealth to deliver, mHealth application developers
should ideally consult with medical or health informati-
cians trained to understand the information flows
involved in health care processes.3 At the same time, to
reach a wider market and to achieve sustainability, many

mHealth applications need to offer standardized services
that can be delivered and accessed by nonexperts. Finally,
mHealth should be integrated with larger eHealth
programs and aligned with the delivery of offline health
care services (box 3.1). So far, short message service (SMS)
texting has probably been the most prominent mode of
delivery (see table 3.1 and box 3.2), perhaps, according to
some research, because texting is already an integral part
of mobile usage culture (Gombachika and Monawe 2011).
Increasingly, however, mHealth services are also offered as

Kenya has emerged as a leading player in mobile
for development, largely because of the success
of the mPesa mobile payment ecosystem,
based on local application developers, projects
mounted by local nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), favorable governmental policies,
foreign investment, and stable economic condi-
tions. This active ecosystem has benefited the
health sector, with many mHealth applications
being piloted in Kenya.
Unfortunately, the proliferation of pilot
programs, with diverse goals and stakehold-
ers, has fragmented the Kenyan mHealth
landscape: standardized platforms that are
well-integrated with the local health care
system are lacking; few projects have been
endowed with long-term funding; and
systematic evaluation and impact studies are
scarce. 
Only recently have more streamlined
coordination and division of responsibilities
started to emerge. Increasingly, the govern-
ment is taking over mHealth implementation
and ensuring that it complements national
policy, while NGOs undertake research,
monitoring, and evaluation. Kenya certainly
offers an insightful repertoire of mHealth
applications. 
A recent notable effort is MEDAfrica.org, a company launched in November 2011 that is currently
being incubated in the infoDev mobile applications lab in Nairobi (see chapter 5). The application inte-
grates symptom checkers, first-aid information, doctor and hospital directories, and alert services
into a single, customizable mobile information platform (see screenshot in this box). MEDAfrica won
the East African application contest Pivot 25.
MEDAfrica is also pioneering a viable business model, which has attracted worldwide
media and investor attention. Other Kenyan mHealth applications are based on remote moni-
toring or supply chain management through simple SMS technology. Examples include
systems for HIV medication reminders, children’s health monitoring, early-infant HIV diagno-
sis, and medicine validation through scratch codes.

Box figure 3.2.1 RapidSMS in Ethiopia
Ethiopia faces significant challenges to effective performance in its health sector. The country
is struggling to reduce maternal and child mortality, preventable communicable diseases, and
malnutrition. While some policy initiatives have achieved notable success, Ethiopia is likely to
meet only one of the six health-related targets under the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015. Health care coordination, monitoring, and supply chain management are
largely deficient. Funding is limited and well-trained health staff scarce.
In 2008 Ethiopia was hit by severe droughts, leading UNICEF to administer a large-scale
food distribution program. Because of the country’s poor telecommunication infrastructure
and low technical literacy, however, inventory management at local distribution centers was
 arduous: teams of monitors had to travel back and forth to the centers to deliver hand-
 written reports of inventory. Inventory analysis could be started only after the data had been
delivered, which often took several weeks. In response, UNICEF worked with RapidSMS,
which helped cut delays in data transmission related to paper-based collection. Transmission
times were reduced from about two months to approximately two minutes. Additionally,
data quality discrepancies decreased from 14.2 percent to 2.8 percent while generating
significant cost savings. In developing RapidSMS, UNICEF has shown that mHealth appli-
cations can represent a feasible low-tech response to challenging conditions such as those
in Ethiopia.
RapidSMS was designed to be a simple supply chain management tool, which auto-
matically integrates inventory information sent by SMS into a central database in real time.
SMS technology is easily accessible and robust, and minimal training is needed to use the
application. RapidSMS allows for stock taking, new admissions, precise location of distri-
bution centers, and analysis of the quantities of food distributed and consumed. This analy-
sis was sped up by immediate visualizations in graphs and maps, accessible by offices in
all locations. Monitors still have to travel to distribution centers, but from there they can
immediately send stock information to the server. Saving days in travel literally saves lives:
UNICEF can respond to shortages and deliver new food resources more promptly, rapidly,
and efficiently.
The RapidSMS system is a success story, but several issues arose, including a lack of
standards for coding distribution centers, poor allocation of responsibilities, and slow reso-
lution of technical issues. This experience underlines the need for ICT systems to be inte-
grated into existing health care systems as well as the need for capacity building to use ICT
effectively.

Optimism about the potential of mHealth is growing;
indeed, its potential to be a cost-effective solution for health
care in developing countries has led to a growing influx of
funds, mainly from public sector and civil society donors
(Vital Wave Consulting 2011). In turn, the funding is scat-
tered and mHealth implementations are too often stand-
alone pilot programs. Further, mHealth can help consumers
and communities in the developing world keep themselves
informed and take more control of their health choices.4 The
opportunities that mobile phones offer for health monitoring
could mean that people will start thinking of their phones as
personal digital assistants (PDAs) to take care of their health.
In parallel, entry barriers for the supply of applications are
often lower for mHealth than for other eHealth services or
conventional delivery of health care, because small start-ups
and local developers can develop mobile software with rela-
tively few resources and can address a much wider potential
user base. The shift from eHealth to mHealth can also create
an opportunity for a shift from top-down to bottom-up
approaches, from government to consumer initiatives,
and from centralized to decentralized spending, if
mHealth initiatives are effectively implemented.
However, the health sector remains both complex and
challenging. The most relevant challenges to the greater
uptake of mHealth include: 
• Insufficient financial resources. Obstacles to comprehensive
mHealth solutions are often financial, especially in the
developing world. In particular, if no payment structures
have been established, it is unclear who should cover the
costs for mHealth in private health care (consumers,
governments, insurance companies?). This is critical, since
the largest part of the cost is often related not to the devel-
opment of the mHealth application but to the integration
of mHealth services with other health care infrastructure. 
• Lack of sustainable business models. The roll-out of
mHealth and other eHealth products and services needs
sustainable business models and revenues. Besides a lack
of public and private investments in developing such
products and services, low-income countries often lack
human resources and purchasing power on the demand
side. Thus, business models cannot simply be adapted
from the developed world but must be designed to
match the scarcity of resources both on the demand and
supply side.
• Privacy and security concerns. Typically, mHealth faces
significant privacy and security concerns, with limita-
tions on access to patient data that can complicate inter-
actions between different systems such as primary care,
emergency care, and insurance. 
• Limited evidence. Reliable assessments on the impact of
mHealth services are scarce, making it difficult to justify
adoption and implementation.
• Difficult coordination of stakeholders. Orchestrating
diverse private, public, and development sector interests
for mHealth can be challenging. Clear roles have yet to be
defined, and role models are lacking. The different stake-
holders have different goals and strategies that often over-
lap and conflict, leading to frictions and inefficiencies.
• Interoperability issues. Piecemeal implementation of
mHealth products and services has led to a lack of inter-
operability between applications that run on different
devices and platforms.
The potential of mHealth
Despite the growing popularity of mHealth, in both usage
and commercial terms, there is a disappointing lack of
comprehensive studies evaluating its impact. Overall,
mHealth is often associated with lower costs and improve-
ments in the quality of health care, but also with a focus on
the prevention of diseases and promotion of healthy
lifestyles. In line with this assertion, a recent study estimates
that mHealth reduces data collection costs by approximately
24 percent, costs of elderly care by 25 percent, and maternal
and perinatal mortality by 30 percent (Telenor Group 2012).
The same study finds that mHealth can improve compliance
with tuberculosis treatment by 30–70 percent.
Given consumers’ higher purchasing power and their
shown willingness to pay for mHealth applications and
devices (IBM Institute for Business Value 2010; Mobi-
HealthNews 2009), huge business opportunities have been
identified, mainly in the developed world. Of note, in 2011
the third convention of the mHealth Summit attracted
more than 3,600 visitors, up from fewer than 800 in 2009
50
Information and Communications for Development 2012

(mHealth Alliance 2011), and the mHealth market went up
from $718 million in 2011 to an estimated $1.3 billion in
2012 in the United States alone (Telecoms Tech 2012). In
particular, mHealth applications aimed at individuals are
growing in popularity. The number of health-related appli-
cations in Apple’s App Store grew from just over 4,000 in
February 2010 to more than 15,000 by September 2011;
roughly 60 percent of these were aimed directly at
consumers, with the most popular applications relating to
cardio workouts and diet (figure 3.1). The most popular
health-related search in 2011 was for information on
chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, suggesting that
the privacy offered by mobile access to health information
is important to users. Also the use of “wellness apps” is seen
to be growing: an estimated 30 percent of smartphone users
are likely to use them by 2015 (Telenor Group 2012).
Currently, applications focusing on individuals are mainly
geared to developed countries, where purchasing power and
education are higher.
Yet, mHealth arguably offers even greater potential in the
developing world, where mobile phones serve not only as
communication tools but also as key means for accessing
health information, obtaining medical insurance, and
making payments. As long as macroeconomic conditions are
at least somewhat favorable, a lack of existing structures can
translate into a greater scope for mHealth solutions; it is
expected that major emerging economies, finding them-
selves in rapid transition to new health care structures, will
see the strongest uptake of mHealth in the years to come
(Freng et al. 2011). Because of the diversity of mHealth
applications and the limited potential of mHealth commer-
cialization, however, the larger economic or development
impact of mHealth is difficult to assess, and there is a lack of
systematic data for the developing world that would justify
higher-level investments (Qiang et al. 2012).
Nonetheless, more than 500 mHealth projects have
been deployed around the world (Telenor Group 2012).
According to the World Health Organization’s Global
Observatory for eHealth (GOe), some 83 percent of 112
surveyed countries had at least one mHealth program in
operation, with the majority reporting at least four types
of application (WHO 2011). The same survey showed that
the mHealth adoption gap between low- and high-income
countries is fairly small: 77 percent of the former and 87
percent of the latter reported they had implemented at
least one mHealth program. In absolute terms, Africa is
still the region with the most countries with mHealth
deployments, while the developed world and other devel-
oping regions have seen stronger adoption growth in
recent years (figure 3.2).

Business models for mHealth
Basing mHealth services on a sustainable business model is
vital for implementing mHealth. The first decision that an
mHealth organization has to make is what financing model to
adopt. Broadly, the options are nonprofit, for-profit, or hybrid. 
• Nonprofit organizations may rely less on investments from
the private sector and more on large blocks of funding
from ministries, multilaterals, and other major donors.
Often, a nonprofit mHealth organization’s goal is not
revenue maximization, but maximum development
impact and improvement of patients’ health outcomes. 
• In contrast, for-profit organizations focus on developing
services and products that generate revenues to be
distributed to investors and owners, although they may
also include a philanthropic element, for example, in
probing the opportunities in new markets. 
• Whereas health care almost always implies strong public
sector involvement, there is certainly potential in
mHealth for for-profit projects as well, suggesting that
hybrid models may be an appropriate option. For
instance, a subscription to mDhil’s medical information
service in India, costs 1 rupee ($0.02) a day, which is in
line with the purchasing power of its target consumers—
young Indians between 18 and 25 (Qiang et al. 2012).

The mHealth ecosystem
The emergence of mHealth initiatives in many parts of the
world can make it difficult to assess their impact in a
coherent manner. Increasingly, mHealth stakeholders are
realizing the need to arrive at a more holistic understand-
ing of the subject not only to base implementation on best
practices but also to factor in local circumstances. More-
over, the large number of different stakeholder groups
requires that their different roles and responsibilities be
clarified as well. Because mHealth always exists within and
interacts with a country’s larger health care system, it will
be affected by public policy, private sector influence,
diverse patient needs, and the interests of several other
participants. 
A useful framework for the mHealth ecosystem is
provided in a World Bank report on mobiles in health
(Qiang et al. 2012), which positions mHealth at the
nexus of health, technology, and financial services, with
government influencing all three of these spheres (figure
3.3). This positioning is in line with a common argu-
ment that mobile financial services can enhance the
impact of mHealth initiatives (mHealth Alliance and
WEF 2011).

For both nonprofits and for-profits, clear value proposi-
tions for the still emerging mHealth industry have yet to be
established. Value chains in mHealth can be complicated
even for simple applications (Vital Wave Consulting 2009),
so capturing and monetizing value for only one among many
stakeholders in the chain can be difficult (Freng et al. 2011).
Because demand for mobile applications for health care
delivery is high, however, consumers might be willing to pay
for mHealth, for instance, if the service can help them avoid
disease and the high oppor tunity costs of suffering from a
medical condition.  Cumulative losses in global economic
output from noncom municable diseases are expected to
amount to $47 trillion, or 5 percent of GDP, by 2030, so
governments also have an interest in promoting better access
to health information (Chand 2012).
For now, however, the main challenge for the mHealth
industry in low-income countries has been to continue to
deliver services once initial funding of pilot projects ends
and to scale up or replicate effective models in large-scale
implementations. This challenge results in part from a
lack of long-term feasible business models. In developed
countries, many mobile apps are offered free of charge,
with revenues derived from advertising. Fee-for-services
is a secondary model (for example, some health apps in
Apple’s App Store cost up to $79). To obtain sustainable
investment in this emerging industry, the private sector
needs to demonstrate effective and robust mobile apps
that address both local and national health needs, espe-
cially for low- and middle-income countries, where aver-
age per-user revenues are lower. In cases where incentives
for the private sector are not strong enough (that is,
where the market prospects are too uncertain, or
consumers lack purchasing power), the public sector will
have to fill the gap, for example, by directly subsidizing
mHealth services, limiting administrative cost for licens-
ing, or engaging in public-private partnerships.
The business models for mHealth must follow the actual
health care needs of individuals and the public to be
sustainable. As health is considered a public good, the busi-
ness models should also be aligned with public policy inter-
ventions. Investment in mobile applications for public
health issues such as noncommunicable diseases should
help reduce the costs of health care services and guarantee a
healthier population and workforce for developing
economies.
Principles for implementing mHealth
applications
Clearly, the field of mHealth is just beginning to demon-
strate its full potential. So far, there have been many pilot
projects and scattered initiatives, with dramatically varying
levels of success (table 3.2). This section briefly outlines
some of the principles that hold across contexts from these
early mHealth initiatives.5
Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach 
Mobile health applications must be designed to respond to
people’s needs and suited to their local context. A common
pitfall is that, once an application is working well technically
and is seen to have high potential, there is an immediate
enthusiasm to implement it everywhere regardless of
context. Conducting readiness assessments with users can
help avoid such overextension. Close involvement of health
practitioners in the design and development of mobile app
content can also ensure accuracy for public health programs.
A good example of successful adaptation to various contexts
and sectors is RapidSMS—this system has been used for
food supply chain management in Ethiopia (see box 3.2), as
a citizen outreach system in Senegal (see table 3.2), and as an
emergency response tool in Somalia (Vital Wave Consulting
2011). The success of RapidSMS has also sparked the devel-
opment of other mHealth tools, such as ChildCount+ (Vital
Wave Consulting 2011).
Maintain flexibility
Policy-makers must be careful not to overregulate mHealth
nor to prescribe, from the top down, how applications are to
be implemented. Because mHealth technology is cheap to
implement and change, it can be a tool for achieving effi-
ciencies and improved flexibility in the health system.
Mobile health can also be combined with other mobile ser-
vices to enhance its impact. The industry may also evolve
freely, including in ways that the health sector may not antic-
ipate. For example, mHealth and mMoney can be integrated
in a variety of useful ways. A patient might receive a
prescription through an mHealth application and pay for it
using an mMoney transfer or bank account, all using the
same mobile phone. Health care workers who spend most of
their time in the field and transfer information to health
systems through mobile phones could receive their wages in
the same way.

Take standards and interoperability into account
Although apps should be adapted to local context, designing
a separate and incompatible application for every stake-
holder group or every locale frequently leads to large ineffi-
ciencies. Applications often benefit from economies of scale
and reach—the power of singular mHealth services can be
multiplied by their ability to work together, operate on
common platforms, and share information. Making interop-
erability a prerequisite for new mHealth applications could
help reduce inefficiency or duplication. Accordingly, a lack
of standards is seen as preventing the scaling up of applica-
tions and, thus, to be a key obstacle to achieving cost savings
through mHealth (Telenor Group 2012). The perspective
should go beyond the health sector: seamless integration
with other mobile platforms, such as mobile money, can
enhance the value of mHealth applications even more.
A push for more universal platforms can come from the
top (for instance, as part of a national eHealth strategy
that encompasses mHealth) or from the bottom (espe-
cially at the point of care through mobile phones). The
greatest value will be realized when both strategies are
used and complement each other. International standards
for hardware and software platforms can ensure interoper-
ability among mHealth applications and other mobile
tools, while also enabling the development of locally rele-
vant applications. International bodies such as the
mHealth Alliance, the Health Metrics Network, and the
Continua Health Alliance are helping to forge cooperation
in the development of globally recognized standards and
metrics. For example, to achieve seamless exchange of data
elements, HL7 and ISO standards have been widely used
for electronic health records. Standards and interoperabil-
ity must be addressed early on—consolidating many frag-
mented or incompatible services is hard, as cases like
Kenya (see box 3.1) or Ethiopia (see box 3.2) have shown.
Evaluate existing information systems
Multiple health information systems exist and data are gath-
ered with or without mobile applications. Reliable assess-
ments of these systems are useful to identify where mHealth
is needed and how it can best be implemented. Evaluation of
delivery flows of health services should also be taken into
consideration. Mobile apps may prove complementary to
existing solutions, especially for remote data collection and
telemedicine—for example, in the cases of the Health
Management and Research Institute in India (box 3.3), the
EpiHandy program in Uganda, the IHISM system in
Botswana, and the Dokoza system in South Africa (Vital
Wave Consulting 2011). Accordingly, it is estimated that
mHealth can double the number of rural patients reached by
a physician (Telenor Group 2012).
Poor evaluation of current information systems before
entering the digital arena may result in fragmented or inap-
propriate health care applications. For example, it is vital for
mHealth applications to be interoperational with eGovern-
ment applications in other sectors. A success story in this
context is Rwanda, which has implemented an overarching
eHealth initiative combining patient record tracking, trans-
missible disease monitoring, and supply chain management,
as well as mHealth telemedicine apps for health profession-
als in remote areas (Vital Wave Consulting 2011).
Track key success indicators for monitoring and 
evaluation
The need for evaluation does not end once an mHealth
application has been implemented. To move from pilot proj-
ects to full-scale implementation, evidence is needed on the
impact of mHealth applications, along with identification of
operational efficiencies and detailed estimates of cost
savings. In short, monitoring and evaluation (including
tracking project-specific success indicators) are necessary
right from the beginning of an mHealth implementation.
However, only 7 percent of low-and lower-middle income
countries report that they evaluate their mHealth initia-
tives (WHO 2011), and only a few systematic analyses of
nongovernmental projects exist. A rare exception is WelTel
(Lester et al. 2010), an SMS-based tool for tracking
compliance with antiretroviral therapy. Peer-reviewed
evidence confirmed its positive influence on health
outcomes beyond the initial stages, which, in turn, led to
the continuation of funding for the project and its
increased sustainability.
Ensure quality and content of health information
The content and quality of health information must be
tailored to end users and decision-makers. Lack of trust is a
major resistance factor against the use of mobile 
applications in health care provision. Similarly, local
languages and cultures often represent major barriers to
adoption. One notable example of the relevance of trust in
health information is the Indian mobile platform mDhil.
While it received significant private sector investment and

was able to attract a fairly large base of paying customers,
one of its biggest challenges was to establish credibility and
win the trust of its users, given the inaccuracy and lack of
clarity of much of the health information it had to draw on
(Qiang et al. 2012).
Respect privacy and confidentiality
Although awareness of the issue of data privacy is often low
in developing countries, the case can be made that mecha-
nisms guaranteeing some level of privacy and confidentiality
are a universal requirement for mHealth. Evidence from
developed economies shows that privacy and confidentiality
are important success factors in the management of public
and personal data, especially in the case of infectious and
transmissible diseases. For example, the privacy and confi -
dentiality of personal data of patients is vital to prevent
discrimination in the workplace. The dangers of poor privacy
requirements are often visible only after the damage is done
(for example, once security leaks are exploited by hackers),
making this a natural field for government intervention and
regulation (Qiang et al. 2012). However, privacy regulation
should be limited according to context. For instance, health
records on nonstigmatizing infectious diseases (such as dengue
fever) should be shared quickly and widely, while a patient’s
interests in the confidentiality of personal data might triumph,
for example, in cases of sexually transmitted diseases.

India’s Health Management and Research Institute (HMRI) is a public-private partnership
between the state government of Andhra Pradesh (which bears 95 percent of costs) and the
Satyam Foundation (which bears 5 percent of costs) based in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.
HMRI launched “104 Mobile” in 2008a to improve local health services by replacing the tradi-
tional health care system with mHealth applications for disease surveillance, prevention coun-
seling, telemedicine, and supply chain management. 
104 Mobile sends medical units (MUs) to habitations more than three kilometers away
from the nearest public health service provider to provide medical care to rural populations.
Each MU circulates on a fixed date every month, ensuring continuity of care. Maternal and
child health are prioritized, along with the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases such
as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and epilepsy. 104 Mobile deployed 475 MUs to 22 districts
throughout Andhra Pradesh. Generally, treatments at clinics tend to be costly, and more than
half of unmet requests for outpatient care could be treated by phone in rural areas—a poten-
tial that 104 Mobile can exploit through its hotline for medical consultations. 
HMRI has delivered the following major benefits (partly thanks to the integration of
mHealth applications): 
•
Expanded the service area covered by 25 percent
•
Services may cost as little as one-tenth of those provided by the government 
•
Up to 55 percent of 600,000 unmet requests for outpatient treatment could be treated by phone
•
1.26 million pregnant women each received an average of three antenatal care check-ups 
•

Enable public-private partnerships 
Policy-makers contemplating mHealth should consider
bringing private sector stakeholders to the table. If admin-
istered wisely, public investment and technology partner-
ships enriched with competitive incentives (through
tenders and challenges, for example) can improve the qual-
ity of mHealth apps and services and improve choice.
Often, public-private partnerships (PPPs) can benefit from
a division of labor based on the respective competencies
and resources of the stakeholders. For instance, private
mobile operators and software developers might be better
situated to provide the technological platform and develop
the mHealth applications, while governments can provide a
favorable regulatory environment and integration with the
existing (public) health care system (Qiang et al. 2012).
Governments might also use a PPP approach to spark inno-
vation from a more agile private sector. This approach
seems to be very effective; the largest and most scalable
mHealth initiatives are mostly supported by PPPs (WHO
2011). One notable project is ChildCount+: the Kenyan
government, the Millennium Villages Project, and UNICEF
collaborated with Zain and Sony Ericsson as technology
partners to develop a monitoring and tracking system with
a focus on easily treatable diseases; the new system is
expected to dramatically reduce child and maternal mortal-
ity (Qiang et al. 2012).
Offer training and take literacy into account 
Mobile health services will have a greater impact on health
outcomes where their users have high levels of literacy (and
for health workers, training) in ICT and health. Proficiency
with mobile devices and computers saves time and reduces
errors. As a result, during mHealth implementation, the
technical literacy of users needs to be factored in, and staff
have to be trained to use the necessary technology. In addi-
tion, training in technical and organizational skills is often
needed to launch, scale, and sustain mHealth interven-
tions. For instance, major barriers to adoption of telemed-
icine in Uganda were lack of knowledge and skills on the
part of health care staff (Isabalija et al. 2011). There are
many ways to achieve improvements in these areas: dedi-
cated training institutions, public information campaigns,
programs in schools, and even software for mobile devices
that trains people in their use and in treatment methods.
All of these may ultimately require oversight to ensure that
the information being conveyed corresponds to best prac-
tices and health system priorities.
Ensure the commitment of leaders
The mHealth industry is today at a pivotal moment in its
rapid evolution. To realize the industry’s full potential for
improving health outcomes, long-term leadership is needed
from government and from the health, technology, and
financial sectors. Their leadership will help supply the
industry with better inputs—both tangible (such as handset
technology and financing) and intangible (such as market
regulations, standardization of software, and rules for using
bandwidth). It will also ensure that mHealth services corre-
spond to health sector priorities. The impact of committed
leadership can be magnified by a series of multipliers—
improvements in reach, affordability, quality assurance,
behavioral norms, and matching of resources—that can
boost health outcomes. High-level leadership within
government is especially crucial for forging inter-ministry
partnerships. 
Conclusions 
As this chapter has argued, mHealth applications have the
potential to transform health care systems in low-income
economies: mHealth can generate cost savings and
provide more effective health care delivery within rela-
tively limited resources. Modern forms of health care are
at a tipping point where consumers are taking on more
responsibility for managing their own health choices, and
mobile phones could contribute greatly to this shift of
decision-making from state and health institutions to the
individual. However, the most substantial challenge for
mHealth is the establishment of viable and sustainable
business models that can be replicated and scaled up. One
step forward could be clearer delineation of roles within
the health ecosystem between public and private health
care providers. Accordingly, for “macro”-focused public
health purposes, the World Health Organization (WHO
2005) recommends that mHealth be integrated into a
country’s broader eHealth strategy. Finally, a missing
component is the effective monitoring and evaluation of
mHealth, which could inform the design of more success-
ful mHealth applications at this critical stage of their
development.

M
obile financial services are among the most
promising mobile applications in the devel-
oping world. Mobile money could become a
general platform that transforms entire economies, as it is
adopted across commerce, health care, agriculture, and
other sectors. To date, at least 110 money mobile systems
have been deployed, with more than 40 million users. The
most well-known system, M-PESA, started in Kenya and is
now operational in six countries; it has 20 million users who
transferred $500 million a month during 2011.1 While the
benefits of mobile money payment systems are clear,
observers remain divided over whether mobile money
systems are truly fulfilling their growth potential.
This chapter evaluates the benefits and potential impact of
mobile money, especially for promoting financial inclusion
in the developing world, before providing an overview of the
key factors driving the growth of mobile money services. It
also considers some of the barriers and obstacles hindering
their deployment. Finally, it identifies emerging issues that
the industry will face over the coming years. 
Mobile money: an ecosystem
approach
At the most basic level, mobile money is the provision of
financial services through a mobile device (box 4.1).2 This
broad definition encompasses a range of services, including
payments (such as peer-to-peer transfers), finance (such as
insurance products), and banking (such as account balance
inquiries). In practice, a variety of means can be used such
as sending text messages to transfer value or accessing bank
account details via the mobile internet (figure 4.1). Special
“contactless” technologies are available that allow phones to
transfer money to contactless cash registers. 
Although mobile phones are central to all these uses,
mobile money is more than just technology—it needs a
cash-in, cash-out infrastructure, usually accomplished
through a network of “cash merchants” (or “agents”), who
receive a small commission for turning cash into electronic
value (and vice versa). 
Because the mobile money industry exists at the inter-
section of finance and telecommunications, it has a diverse
set of stakeholders, with players from different fields in
competition. Mobile network operators, banks, and increas-
ingly new entrants, such as payment card firms, continue to
catalyze the industry with innovative offerings, but to be
sustainable, these must be met with sufficient demand from
consumers and firms—a variable missing in many contexts.
A host of supporting businesses, such as agents and liquid-
ity management firms, are also necessary. In areas where it
has proved successful, mobile money has created a platform
for start-ups to build upon (Kendall et al. 2011). Finally, all
of this must happen in an environment with appropriate
government regulations for both finance and the ICT

sector, as well as appropriate safeguards for consumer
protection.
The financial inclusion imperative
Poverty is more than just a lack of money. It involves a lack
of access to the instruments and means through which the
poor could improve their lives. Exclusion from the formal
financial system has increasingly been identified as one of
the barriers to a world without poverty. In many develop-
ing countries, more than half of households lack an
account with a financial institution, while small firms
frequently cite difficulty in accessing and affording financ-
ing as a key constraint on their growth. This exclusion
does not necessarily mean that the poor lack active finan-
cial lives: in fact, the fragility of their situation has led to
the development of sophisticated informal financial
instruments. However, the use of only informal instru-
ments means that the poor are limited in their ability to
save, repay debts, and manage risk responsibly. On a
macroeconomic level, these financial constraints on the
poor can slow economic growth and exacerbate inequality
(Demirgüç-Kunt, Beck, and Honahan 2008). 
Finding innovative models to extend financial services to
the poor has now become an urgent challenge. The excite-
ment around mobile money has arisen in part because it is
widely seen as an effective way to provide access to finance to
millions of people around the globe. According to the
Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), roughly 
1 billion people have a mobile phone but no bank account.
Providing them access to mobile financial services will involve
difficult implementation that is unlikely to succeed quickly. 
In addition to extending financial services to the poor,
mobile money is expected to improve productivity by
increasing the efficiency and lowering the cost of transac-
tions, improving security, generating new employment
opportunities, and creating a platform on which other busi-
nesses can grow. 
Mobile money could transform financial inclusion.
“Where most financial inclusion models have employed
either ‘credit-led’ or ‘savings-led’ approaches, the M-PESA
experience suggests that there may be a third approach—
focusing on building the payment ‘rails’ on which a broader
set of financial services can ride,” wrote the authors of one
report (Mas and Radcliffe 2010). As illustrated in the next
section, while benefits from the simple diffusion of an
improved infrastructural “rail” are significant, even greater
impact arises because mobile money systems can serve as a
platform for additional innovations, whether they be bill
payment services that avoid lengthy queue times or more
striking examples such as efficient conditional cash transfers
for drought relief or compensation.3 In places where no

Mobile phones are multifunctional devices that allow for a variety of communication methods.
These range from ubiquitous voice and SMS channels to more sophisticated means such as soft-
ware applications or web browsers. To be a viable solution for mobile money, the channel should
ideally be universally available (including the cheapest mobile phones) and must be secure. In
practice, this requirement largely limits mobile money to using a standard network service, such
as USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) or SMS (short message system), or an
application preloaded on a unique SIM card. Since mobile operators control both of these chan-
nels, they remain essential gatekeepers in deploying mobile money.

financial infrastructure exists, this type of change is truly
transformational. 
What is the impact of mobile money?
According to data from the GSM Association, most of the
100-plus deployments of mobile money systems have been
in developing countries, with around half in Africa alone
(figure 4.2). Mobile money systems can be made available
wherever there is wireless phone service, helping to over-
come distance, as well as the lack of branch offices in rural
areas (box 4.2). 
Since mobile money is often linked to financial inclusion,
it is vital to understand how and under what conditions
mobile money applications can extend financial services to
the poor. Support for mobile money initiatives from govern-
ments, nongovernmental organizations, and the interna-
tional development community needs to be justified by
assessing the impact on development goals such as financial
inclusion, poverty reduction, increased productivity, and
risk management. 
Although the mobile money industry has achieved signif-
icant scale in only a handful of countries, a growing number
of studies are establishing its impact in a variety of areas. Its
potential advantages include benefits arising from the inher-
ent characteristics of the services; benefits arising organically
from widespread usage and network effects; and benefits
arising from purposeful and innovative applications, either
made by developers or created by people’s uses of mobile
money services.4
Inherent benefits
Mobile money is often successful because it is considerably
cheaper than other alternatives to cash. In an international
comparison of 26 banks, McKay and Pickens (2010) found
that branchless banking (including mobile money) was 19
percent cheaper on average than alternative services. At low
transaction amounts or for informal money transfer
options, this difference more than doubled.5 In Kenya 
M-PESA was routinely one-third to one-half as expensive as
alternative systems. Lower costs directly translate into
money the poor can keep—in Kenya the amount of money
remitted increased when transferred using M-PESA
compared with traditional forms of remittances. Conversely,
where transaction costs are high, as in Botswana where the
cost per transaction is a minimum of 8 pula ($1.07), mobile
money has been slow to take root.
Well-supervised mobile money can be safer than alterna-
tives, including cash. Early studies of M-PESA in low-
income areas found that the risk of muggings declined,
because cash was less evident. Because it is less visible than
cash, mobile money also has consequences for privacy and
autonomy. Research has found that women are able to have
personal savings without seeking permission from their
husbands (Morawczynski 2009), but, of course, this auton-
omy holds true for both genders.6
The speed and liquidity of mobile money are also key
benefits. The limited assets the poor own often take the form
of valuable objects (such as livestock or gold), which are
relatively illiquid. In times of crisis, such assets can be diffi-
cult to realize quickly, and their value may decline if the

Mobile money applications are typically small pieces of software embedded on a SIM card or
available over a mobile network. A customer can use an inexpensive mobile to send value to
someone else. To change this digital value into cash, a user simply visits a retail agent who
verifies the user’s identity and makes the switch. In this way, money can cross enormous
distances at the speed of a text message. Consider a young Tanzanian who has moved to Dar
es Salaam to find work. With mobile money, he can send regular, small payments to his family
at their rural home without needing to pay and trust a courier or take it himself. His family can
then exchange the digital value for cash at a local agent. 
Box 4.2 Using mobile money
market floods with other families seeking to convert similar
assets to cash at the same time. Moreover, sending gold
bracelets or cash to a family or friend in need can be a risky
enterprise. Mobile money can be an accessible and conven-
ient medium for the delivery of financial services and more
reliable than traditional, informal methods.
Benefits from scale
In some jurisdictions, mobile money has achieved critical
mass, so nonusers are encouraged to adopt the systems used
by their peers. When the poor are connected on a large scale,
they are able to use mobile money to improve their liveli-
hoods. The best data available on this point comes again
from Kenya, where households with access to mobile money
were better able than those without to manage negative
shocks (including job loss, death of livestock, or problems
with harvests). Whereas households that did not use M-
PESA saw consumption fall by 6–10 percent on average, M-
PESA users were often able to fully absorb the shocks,
because they received more remittances and lost less to
transaction costs (Suri and Jack 2011). Evidence of such
“livelihood strategies” was also evident during the violence
following Kenya’s 2007 election, during which M-PESA
“became one of the only means through which [residents of
Nairobi’s informal Kibera settlement] could access cash”
(Morawczynski 2009). Even in less tumultuous times,
mobile money at scale can serve to meet the needs of the
poor: research in Kenya found that M-PESA was a useful
means to access cash. Often the poor lack fungible sources of
exchange such as cash, and through the network of cash
agents and people’s contacts willing to send value, mobile
money allows many to get cash when and where they need it
(Stuart and Cohen 2011).
Mobile money can also prove commercially significant
for service providers, when it reaches scale. Although the
transaction fees that mobile money providers charge are
individually quite small, in total, they can represent an
important revenue source. For example, Safaricom, the
mobile operator that offers M-PESA, reported mobile
money revenues for the first half of 2011 of K Sh 7.9 billion
($90 million). In addition, cash agents may also gain
commercial benefit from the fees they receive.
Benefits from innovation
Improving the ability of the poor to transfer money is
certainly beneficial, but in isolation, mobile transfer ser -
vices do not capture the full potential of mobile money to
enhance financial inclusion. Early studies of South
African mobile money found that while it had the poten-
tial to advance financial inclusion, it had not increased
access to banking, especially compared with nontechno-
logical efforts, such as a particular type of bank account
designed especially for the poor (Porteous 2007). In
Kenya, for example, the predominant use of M-PESA 
is still sending money, although some people use it for
savings (Stuart and Cohen 2011). Access and use of more
sophisticated financial services such as savings, credit, and
insurance could prove far more beneficial to the poor. To
develop these services, businesses, governments, and
other institutions must innovate actively on top of the
payment services that are being deployed by mobile
money operators.7

Some organizations are deliberately using mobile money
to enhance their traditional offerings. For example, during a
recent drought in Niger, a set of randomly selected house-
holds received cash transfers via mobile money (Aker et al.
2011). In comparison with physical cash, this trial found
lower variable costs for senders, as well as lower costs for
recipients. Over the course of the crisis, recipient households
also enjoyed better diets and depleted fewer assets. 
Insurance, credit, and savings services are now being
developed atop mature mobile money systems. Kilimo
Salama is a micro-insurance product that uses M-PESA to
provide payouts to smallholder farmers whose crops fail. In
its second year of operation, 12,000 farmers were insured,
and 10 percent of those received payouts of up to 50 percent
of their insured inputs (Sen and Choudhary 2011). Likewise,
Equity Bank and Safaricom have partnered to offer 
M-Kesho, a mobile service that offers microsavings
accounts, credit, and insurance. As individuals develop
financial histories with mobile money, the ability to provide
credit can expand because financial institutions will be able
to analyze those histories and assign credit scores.
The impact of mobile money is also likely to extend to the
public sector through increased efficiency and reach.
Government adoption of mobile money is still in its infancy,
but a study by McKinsey for the Gates Foundation estimates
that connecting poor Indian households to an electronic
payment system for cash transfers would have considerable
impact through reduced leakages, transaction costs, and
overheads (Lochan et al. 2010). It would also improve the
government’s ability to monitor financial flows, collect tax
revenues, and reduce illicit activity. Government use of
mobile money—such as salary disbursements—could prove
to be an enormous driver of the service throughout the
economy on the whole. 
Growing mobile money: challenges
and success stories
Despite a growing number of successes, the mobile money
industry faces a number of challenges. Mobile money
deployments in developing countries often target customers
who may be poor, dispersed, and remote. Mobile money also
spans two distinct industries with different business models.
Telecommunications and payments are transaction-based,
with fees collected on transactions; conversely, banking is
float-based, with money earned through holding deposits.
Developing the necessary cross-sectoral partnerships—
including bridging cultures and regulations—may therefore
prove difficult. 
Additionally, mobile money services represent a two-
sided market, and new deployments must convince both
agents (supply) and customers (demand) to sign up for the
service in sufficient quantity to be viable. Building and prop-
erly incentivizing the agent network is no small task, and
maintaining the necessary cash liquidity at the outlets can
prove a constant challenge. Winning and retaining the trust
of customers, including those who are poor and new to the
technology, is central to success. Commercial viability in this
industry requires scale, and operators are faced with the
trade-off between higher costs to recoup their investments
or lower costs to reach scale and build a mass market (Mas
and Radcliffe 2010). 
Despite these challenges, mobile money has grown in a
variety of markets. Although the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) identified more than 50 factors influenc-
ing the growth of mobile money, 3 are especially important
(IFC 2011): regulation, competition with other instruments
of financial access, and user perceptions and skills.
Regulation
Since mobile money straddles finance and telecommunica-
tions, it faces regulation originating within two different
sectors. For mobile money to develop, regulations must
encourage inclusiveness, while minimizing fraud and risk.
The uncertainty associated with innovative industries means
that regulations must be incremental and proportional.
Kenya’s initial success with mobile money was arguably
based on a virtual absence of formal regulation in favor of
industry-government engagement (World Bank 2010).
However, since mobile money services manage the limited
capital of the poor, caution is essential (USAID 2010). 
Successful regulation is usually marked by collaborative
exchange between industry, government, and civil society.
For example, regulation should allow agents outside of bank
branches to handle financial transactions and develop tiered
anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer (AML/
KYC) requirements. To facilitate more sophisticated ser -
vice offerings, ongoing regulatory development will be
necessary—for example, most mobile money is regulated
as “payments,” “denying e-money accounts the benefit of
interest payments and deposit insurance” (Ehrbeck and
Tarazi 2011). In considering these new regulatory issues,

protection against fraud and failure, including regular
monitoring by financial regulators, is essential. But it is
also important to remember the goal is to find ways to
provide society’s poor with financial services, and often
mobile is the most promising way.8
Existing status of finance and mobile industries
Mobile money is by no means the only instrument for extend-
ing access to finance to the poor; cooperatives, savings and
loans groups, and even ATMs (automated teller machines) are
popular throughout the developing world. Among the factors
that will determine whether mobile money will succeed is the
extent to which alternative options are accessible and desir-
able. In places with sophisticated financial or mobile indus-
tries, the commitment of leading firms to mobile money can
do much to drive adoption of the service, but already-existing
alternatives or a limited market size can limit the economies
of scale necessary for mobile money to succeed. On the other
hand, too low a volume of existing financial services can be a
detriment for mobile money because cash agents need a way
to manage their liquidity (such as traveling to bank branches,
for example). In short, mobile money is one part of the solu-
tion that also requires other forms of infrastructure and
resources (box 4. 3).
User perceptions, behavior, and skills
The success of mobile money also rests on various factors
relating to end users. There may be considerable distrust of
the formal financial services, or people may be uneasy about
parting with their cash. Mobile money operations need to
create a clear and trustworthy value proposition that fits
within social and cultural practices. For example, mobile
phones are widely available, but they are not universal, and
many people in the developing world share or rent phones.
Designing mobile money requires a careful understanding
of these diverse interactions. 
Emerging issues in mobile money
Mobile money is a fast-moving and wide-ranging industry,
but as it matures and evolves, several emerging issues are
worth increased attention. This section flags these issues as a
first step toward finding longer-term solutions. 
Technological issues
It was technological change—in the form of less expensive
phones and expanded network coverage—that made mobile
money feasible. As mobile telephony continues to evolve
toward more sophisticated devices and services, the range of
feasible mobile money applications will continue to expand.9
Over the coming years, three technological developments will
have a significant impact on mobile money: the rise of smart-
phones, near field communications, and biometrics.
Smartphones. Over the coming years, smartphones will
become more widespread in developing markets. The rela-
tively well-off and young individuals who will adopt them
first will serve as important trendsetters, but adoption will
eventually become more widespread. Already, in Kenya,
Huawei is offering an Android-powered smartphone for
under $100, and when smartphones begin to be sold on the
second- and third-hand market, they will be even more
widely accessible. The enhanced capabilities of smartphones
will mean that mobile money applications will move beyond
channels closely controlled by the mobile operators to plat-
forms that are more open to competition (although SMS
and USSD functionality will remain important for reaching
a broader base of customers). Because smartphones serve as
a gateway to the internet, a broader range of applications will
become available, enhancing the need for interoperability.
These changes will be accompanied by opportunities, such
as the chance to use graphical interfaces with illiterate popu-
lations, and challenges, such as the growth in data traffic and
increased burden on network capacities. Smartphones will
also drive home the importance of device-makers to mobile
money. 
Near field communications. Near field communications
(NFC) is a technology that allows devices to communicate
through mere proximity, usually by waving a specially
equipped phone or card near a receiving device, as opposed
to having to physically swipe it. NFC could serve to make
transactions more efficient and secure by reducing errors,
such as those that arise from mistyped numbers. In the
coming years, more phones will be equipped with NFC,
which is expected to become more popular for financial
transactions. For mobile money, this means that transactions
can be completed by waving a phone near a receiver, as
opposed to having to text value to a recipient. Since NFC
requires a new infrastructure to receive the payments, it may
be slow to grow, but as wallets become digitized onto phones,
mobile money agents and businesses may start to use their
own NFC-enabled smartphones to receive payments. Already

Mobile Money for Financial Inclusion
67
Although it has received both direct and indirect support from the public sector, to date, mobile
money remains a private sector enterprise. To achieve profitability, mobile money providers
have pioneered three general business models: mobile-operator-led, bank-led, and collabora-
tive. Because operators control the mobile platform and have significant distribution capacity
through their existing retail agent networks, it is logical that mobile money deployments will
often be initiated by operators who may partner or collaborate with a bank. In some places,
such as Pakistan, where the operator Telenor purchased a 51 percent stake in Tameer Micro-
finance Bank, the boundaries between the two entities may be blurred.
A variety of business models exist for mobile money. Although M-PESA popularized a
model based primarily on peer-to-peer transfers, mobile money systems elsewhere are quite
different. For example, in South Africa, WIZZIT is an independent mobile money provider that
works over all mobile networks and that has partnered with banks to provide customers with
easily accessible accounts. In Thailand, the two relatively successful mobile money operations
have partnered with retailers from the start and emphasize bill payment offerings. 
According to the International Finance Corporation’s Mobile Money Study, in a given
market, the business case for mobile money will be driven by those players with the strongest
incentive to develop mobile money; the primary value proposition for targeted customers; and
the regulation, demand, and partnership requirements. Combining these variables, the Inter-
national Finance Corporation has developed mobile money demand curves that show how
mobile money has different appeal in different environments.

The black curve represents mobile money demand for developing economies. As develop-
ing countries progress, financial infrastructure develops, and competition from banks, credit
card companies, and other financial institutions increases. The black curve becomes dotted
because demand changes from low-cost, low-speed, and infrequent to high-speed and high-
volume as represented by the blue curve. The green curve starts off dotted because devel-
oped countries already have substantial financial infrastructure, thus demand for low-cost,
low-speed, infrequent transactions is low. The continuum is divided into three parts: alterna-
tive infrastructure, transition phase, and collaboration. In developing economies mobile money
acts as an alternative infrastructure to existing financial services; during the transition phase
mobile money moves from an alternative infrastructure to a complementary one. In the collab-
oration phase mobile money must fully integrate with the financial infrastructure.

Box 4.3 (continued)
at the start of 2012, Absa, a large South African bank, was
testing NFC deployments for its payments. 
Biometrics. The Center for Global Development estimates
that over 450 million people in developing countries have had
their biometric data recorded, and this number is expected to
triple over the next five years (Gelb and Decker 2011). The
most ambitious biometric program—India’s Project Aadhaar,
which is aiming to provide a universal ID system for all citi-
zens, including iris scans, ten fingerprints, and a picture of
each face—has been explicitly linked to financial inclusion.10
These identification schemes are typically associated with
security initiatives, but they are also seen as a means of
improving delivery of cash by governments and development
agencies. Many of these programs are in the early stages, and
significant challenges abound. Deploying biometric systems
can be very expensive, and ensuring high accuracy is often out
of reach. Further, it is likely to raise political concerns given
the implications for citizen privacy, so some countries are
opting for less intrusive means of identification.
The changing role of agent networks
Understanding the human dynamics of a growth market is
essential. Building and incentivizing networks that serve as
the cash-in, cash-out point of contact, as well as customers’
primary interface with the brand, is difficult and costly.
Many operators have found that existing airtime resellers are
useful agents, but other intermediaries (such as large-scale
retail chains or post offices) are also likely candidates. This
development is important because increased competition,
not to mention the possibility of digital money lessening the
need for cash, could reduce agents’ profits: in Kenya, 
M-PESA agents have already seen daily profits drop from $5
to $4 (Pickens 2011). 
As mobile money providers have realized the importance
of agents in their business models, four interlinked problems
have emerged: profitability, proximity, liquidity, and trust
(Maurer, Nelms, and Rea forthcoming). The agent model is
founded on the exchange of cash through a franchise model,
so the profitability of agents is vital for success. If the agent
network grows too quickly and saturates the market,
however, mobile money agents may not have sufficient
transactions to remain in business. If agents’ costs for
managing their cash liquidity are too high, they will also
suffer. Finally, if the agents behave improperly or fail to
develop relationships with their customers, the all-impor-
tant client trust will not develop.
Internationalization of mobile money
International remittances are one of the largest sources of
external financing in developing countries and often serve as
a lifeline to the poor.11 However, the costs of transmitting
money from abroad are often large and uncertain. For exam-
ple, according to World Bank data, the cost of sending money
across the Tanzania-Kenya border was nearly 10 times the
price of sending money from the United Kingdom to Pakistan
in 2011 (figure 4.3). Easing and improving international
remittances will have significant development impacts, just

as easing remittance transactions at the domestic level has
done (Maimbo, Saranga, and Strychacz 2011). Prices are
high because of underdeveloped payment systems infra-
structure, inappropriate legal frameworks, and the difficulty
many migrants have obtaining identification in order to
access finance; a lack of transparency, competition, and
consumer protection has also kept prices high. Mobile
money could do much to ease this situation, but regulatory
assistance and the creation of the appropriate payment
systems infrastructure will be required. 
Policy-makers are justifiably concerned about criminal
and terrorist financing, as well as the monetary policy issues
arising from illegal cross-border remittance flows, but regula-
tors need to give increased attention to easing the policy
constraints on internationalization of mobile money. Because
multinational negotiations are time-consuming, smaller pilot
projects could be implemented to explore how to improve the
regulation of international mobile money remittances.
Regions with currency unions, such as parts of West Africa, or
where existing infrastructure is present, such as between
Mexico and the United States, may lead the way here because
foreign exchange considerations have been eliminated.
Competition and interoperability
Additional regulatory attention is also needed for issues of
competition and interoperability. Like other network
industries, economies of scale and high barriers to entry
could create uncompetitive market outcomes in the mobile
money  industry. In cases where a mobile money service is
tied to a dominant mobile network operator (as in the case
of Kenya’s Safaricom, which has 68 percent of the mobile
subscribers market; see Communications Commission of
Kenya 2011), that operator is at an advantage in dictating
the terms of the product. 
The appropriate form of regulation is still emerging and
will depend on context. Premature competition regulation
may even stymie the growth of mobile money. As a recent
World Economic Forum report noted, “initial adoption
appears to be driven by constrained access to formal finan-
cial services, as opposed to well-developed institutions and
competitive markets”(WEF 2011). On the other hand, wait-
ing too long to curtail anticompetitive practices may incur
social and financial costs to society. 
One of the main ways to reduce mobile money market
domination is through interoperability (box 4.4). Interoper-
ability can occur at various levels: in Nigeria, where the
Central Bank has been keen to avoid a dominant market
player, interoperability is required at the level of the bank, the
switch, and the payment channel (IFC 2011). In other coun-
tries, mobile money occurs in a “walled garden” because
interoperability is not technically allowed. Consumers wish-
ing to swap between mobile money services must have multi-
ple SIM cards and use cash to exchange between different
digital wallets (incurring time, effort, and extra fees). 
Sensing a market opportunity, third-party firms are
beginning to offer interoperability between different mobile
money services. Because these interoperability systems are
often unofficial, however, they remain tenuous. While some
observers are of the opinion that consumer demand will
ultimately pressure providers to allow interoperability in
time (IFC 2011), others detect a potential market failure. 
Mobile money operators are often reluctant to allow
formal interoperability because, after investing heavily in
their product, they do not want to make it easy for
customers to move their money to competitors. In fact, in
markets where customers frequently change mobile opera-
tors to save money, mobile money services are seen as a key
way of keeping customers locked into an operator’s own
network. However, it has been argued that interoperability
will benefit operators by expanding the pool of customers,
reducing incentives to have multiple SIM cards (and thus to
make calls on competing networks), and minimizing the
need for retail agents to have cash, which is costly to move
around between different agents (Mas 2011). Interoperability

may also benefit mobile money agents who currently have to
maintain redundant infrastructure for each mobile money
deployment they wish to serve, as well as enhancing overall
efficiency gains in the economy. But because premature
interoperability may limit the market’s development, regula-
tors must approach this issue with caution.
Universal access and service
The populations least likely to feel the benefits of mobile
money are societies’ poorest citizens because they have the
least connectivity, ability to pay, and requisite skills. 
Both mobile network operators and financial institu-
tions find it commercially infeasible to operate in remote
rural areas. In the realm of telecommunications, this
market failure has led to universal access and service funds
that aim to connect all citizens, and the rationale for
extending those to programs to mobile financial services
should be considered. 
Because mobile money has been driven by for-profit enti-
ties, most transactions incur a fee that many poor find diffi-
cult to pay, even if they are willing to do so because of the
convenience and speed of transfer. Regulators must ensure
that the mobile money industry is competitive to allow well-
functioning market forces to drive prices down. As
mentioned, interoperability could serve as a primary lever by
which to reduce redundant costs and expand access.
Finally, many would-be mobile money users lack the
necessary skills—including basic and quantitative literacy—
that are necessary to fully realize the benefit of mobile
money. Mobile money providers have an incentive to
educate consumers about their products, and governments
can support this through promoting transparent business
practices.
Product innovation for meaningful 
financial inclusion
Today, concerns about excluding the poorest from mobile
money are premature in most developing countries. Despite
the runaway success of a few deployments, in the vast major-
ity of cases, mobile money services have struggled to achieve
the scale at which they might raise distributional concerns.12
Surveying the globe, CGAP found that only one in four
branchless banking services (a broad category that includes
mobile money) had more than 1 million registered
customers, and of those launched since 2007, only 1 in 15
has more than 250,000 active customers (Fathallah, Mino,
and Pickens 2011). Furthermore, customer use of many
mobile money services remains low—often only a couple of
70
Information and Communications for Development 2012
The excitement surrounding successful mobile money deployments has spurred significant
additional innovative activity. Surveying the landscape in Kenya, Kendall et al. (2011) found that
M-PESA has emerged as a platform for a wide variety of new applications and services. Busi-
nesses have started integrating M-PESA into their activities, often to improve efficiencies and
reduce costs. Other entrepreneurial ventures offer entirely new services based on the mobile
phone, such as a medical savings plan from Changamka Microhealth Ltd. Finally, an entirely
new category of businesses is developing; these businesses serve as intermediary bridge-
builders, allowing others to integrate with mobile money. For example, Kopo Kopo is a start-
up that offers smaller financial institutions and competing mobile money providers the
technical means to integrate with M-PESA.
There is reason to worry that this initial flourishing is tenuous. The lack of seamless inter-
operability (for example, through an M-PESA application programming interface) is a common
complaint, raising the costs of working with M-PESA. Because it is a proprietary service of
Vodafone, the businesses building on top of the platform are highly dependent upon the
choices of Vodafone and its local affiliate, Safaricom.

Box 4.4 Interoperability and innovation in mobile money

transactions a month. In many cases, the transaction fees
remain too high to enable mobile money to replace cash for
petty purchases.
At the moment, however, a “product gap” exists in most
countries between the financial services the poor are being
offered and the services they want (Morawczynski and
Krepp 2011). The model so successfully pioneered by 
M-PESA—starting with peer-to-peer transfers—has been
widely replicated but may not fit well in other contexts. For
example, an extensive ATM network already meets many of
the consumer financial needs in Thailand. By definition,
mobile money will not have a comparative advantage in
every location or for every service, so the business environ-
ment must be enabling and open to allow businesses to
pioneer new forms of mobile money tailored to local
circumstances.
Product innovation is also essential to realize the full
potential of mobile money. Currently, only 1 in 8 branchless
banking deployments offer functionality beyond basic peer-
to-peer transfers and e-wallet services. Indeed, the IFC’s
study of mobile money in Brazil, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and
Thailand found that the most popular uses for mobile money
were essentially moving money over distance. However,
customers also want the ability to move money over time (in
the form of savings, insurance, and credit). As argued above,
simply formalizing people’s finances onto the mobile plat-
form falls short of meaningful financial inclusion—for that,
the simple “additive” models of mobile money (where mobile
is just another channel) is to move to “transformational”
mobile money (where finance is extended to those previously
unbanked, excluded populations) (Porteous 2007). While a
mobile payment infrastructure is a first step, tailored prod-
ucts and services that enable the poor to better manage and
capitalize on their assets must follow. 
Mitigating the growing pains
In celebrating mobile money as a disruptive innovation, it is
important to remember the second half of that phrase. The
introduction of technology into communities can upset
existing practices, sometimes causing stress or worse.
Although humans are adaptive and generally adopt mobile
money willingly, it is worth being on guard for undesirable
disruptions from innovation. For example, ethnographic
work from Kenya suggests that mobile money users in
Nairobi who had previously traveled frequently to family in
rural areas did so less often after they began to use mobile
money, leading to family troubles arising from worries about
their whereabouts, potential infidelity, and financial stress.
Another example might be the use of mobile money in
microfinance. Many microfinance supporters believe that
the social pressures exerted through face-to-face group
meetings are essential for generating the high rates of repay-
ment that make microfinance viable. If they are correct, the
disintermediation created by mobile money could prove
harmful to microfinance. The Gates Foundation argues that
bringing together different models such as banks, co-ops,
savings-led groups, and mobile money could leverage their
respective strengths, instead of “creating a single synthetic
model” (WEF 2011).
Finally, as mobile money matures, people are increasingly
discussing the “cashless society.” Although that is unlikely,
mobile money may displace many uses of cash. Already, the
Central Bank of Nigeria is promoting “cashless Lagos” in an
effort to reduce the amount of cash circulating in the econ-
omy in favor of electronic transactions, including direct
credit and debit, payment cards, internet-based services, and
mobile money. The U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment, too, is arguing for adopting alternatives that are
“better than cash” (USAID 2010). If this trend toward
replacing cash continues, financial transactions could
become uniquely identified and recorded, introducing
complexities for consumer privacy. Others have suggested
that the provision of money by private companies over
private infrastructure risks undermining an important func-
tion of the public sector, namely, that the means of value
transfer are not “owned” by anyone. 
Conclusions
Many of the characteristics that make mobile money so
promising—its scale and impact, its varied uses, and the
novelty of its role—are also reasons why achieving these
hopes is so difficult. While exciting, the success of a few
mobile money deployments should not shelter the fact that
those examples remain the exception, not the rule. With this
caution in mind, governments, donors, and industry have
good reason to support the creation of vibrant mobile
money services that include the world’s poor in financial
markets and allow them to manage and use their own
money. Although far from the only mechanism, mobile is
certainly one of the most powerful means by which to real-
ize this promise.

2. Mobile money can be considered a subsector of a wider
industry—branchless banking that uses a variety of methods
and technology to extend financial access. 
3. An example of the latter is the World Bank–funded initiative
to use mobile phones to compensate ex-combatants in the
Democratic Republic of Congo; see http://www.mdrp.org/
PDFs/In_Focus_3.pdf. 
4. For additional information on the adoption and impact of
mobile money, see Institute for Money, Technology and
Financial Inclusion (http://www.imtfi.uci.edu) and the Finan-
cial Services Assessment project (http://www.fsassessment
.umd.edu/).
5. In reality, the savings are likely even greater for mobile money
because this study grouped mobile money with other meth-
ods of branchless banking and did not account for the savings
arising from the reduced travel.
6. At the same time, anecdotal evidence suggests that the need to
go to an agent to cash in or cash out can advertise a person’s
relative wealth, perhaps increasing risk.
7. Despite the justifiable promise of such approaches, a word
of caution is worthwhile. Innovation implies the possibility
of failure, and given the precarious situations of the poor,
entities wishing to improve the poor’s financial situation
through mobile money must take every caution to under-
stand the risk involved; see, for example, USAID 2010. As is
evident with other industries working with the poor,
changing incentives and policies can result in disaster.
Furthermore, creating dependencies on private infrastruc-
ture can be disastrous in the event of bankruptcy or other
disruptions.
8. For additional information, see the regulatory resources from
the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor and Chatain et al.
(2011).
9. Although device innovation gets the majority of attention,
larger developments, such as cloud computing or network
standard negotiations, could serve as the underlying infra-
structure for mobile money.
10. However, high-profile disputes around the program in
December 2011 emphasized the clashes that are likely to
emerge with large-scale biometric programs. 
11. Although international remittances are expected to become
increasingly important to the mobile money landscape, it is
essential not to lose sight of the opportunity presented in the
market for domestic remittances. Kendall and Maurer (2012)
document nationally representative surveys of eight African
countries and “a vast and untapped domestic payments market”
with 64 million people in the surveyed countries not using any
formal remittance instrument.
12. Of course, this is not to say that these subscale examples will
not, in the future, raise those concerns. Indeed the very
purpose of this section is to consider that possibility.

iven its strong recent growth, the global mobile
industry is now a major source of employment
opportunities on both the supply and demand
side. Employment opportunities in the mobile industry can
be categorized into direct jobs and indirect jobs, with a
diverse labor force supplying each category. Direct jobs are
created by mobile operators and manufacturers in profes-
sions that range from engineers to managers to sales support
staff. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
estimates that around 1.5 million people are directly
employed in the industry worldwide (ITU 2011). The total
number of jobs fitting this narrow “direct” description may
continue to grow slowly but may begin to decline as the
industry becomes commoditized. Indirect jobs, however,
show strong potential for new growth, in professions
broadly associated with the industry such as application
development, content provision, and call center operations.
Indirect jobs can be created by mobile operators and manu-
facturers as well as by third-party content and device
producers, including entrepreneurs. In some emerging
markets, outsourcing of mobile content development can
also create significant numbers of indirect jobs. In India
alone, the mobile industry is expected to generate around
7 million indirect jobs during 2012 (COAI 2011).
This report argues that faster mobile networks and
more capable smartphones make mobile communications
a platform for innovation across different sectors (such as
health, agriculture, and financial services), supporting
overall employment numbers in an economy. The greatest
potential for employment growth therefore derives from
demand for services enabled by mobile phones. For many
entrepreneurs in developing countries and rural areas, a
mobile device is a tool not only for contacting customers
and accessing the internet, but also for making financial
transactions, establishing a client database, or coordinating
just-in-time supply-chain deliveries. Such critical business
functions can enable small firms to thrive in locations
where accessing markets or selling new products would
otherwise be impossible. It is difficult to estimate the
number of people establishing new companies or the
employment generated as small and microenterprises
expand, but mobile phones undoubtedly contribute to this
process.
It is also difficult to say with certainty how much the
mobile communication sector has contributed to employ-
ment and entrepreneurship to date, because no global count
exists. It seems clear that the sector is a net generator of jobs,
however, even though it can occasionally eliminate employ-
ment opportunities. For example: 
• In the United States alone, the mobile app industry
provided an estimated 466,000 jobs in 2011 with annual
growth rates of up to 45 percent from 2010 to 2011
(TechNet 2012).

Employment

• In Canada a large proportion of mobile apps are used to
deliver games to handheld devices. The gaming sector is
expected to expand by 17 percent over the next two years,
driven by proliferating mobile broadband access; as a
result, mobile games are likely to generate a greater
number of employment opportunities. Of the 348
gaming companies in the country, 77 percent expect to
hire new graduates in 2013 (Secor Consulting 2011). 
• Mobile money schemes have generally proved to be net
generators of jobs. Safaricom’s M-PESA system supports
23,000 jobs for agents in Kenya alone.1 Airtel Kenya, the
second-biggest mobile operator, plans to recruit some
25,000 agents for its mobile money service, Airtel
Money.2
• By boosting access to information about market demand
and prices, mobile phones can also improve conditions
for entrepreneurship.3 A number of studies have shown
that cell phones make entrepreneurial ventures less risky,
mainly by reducing information search costs.4
This chapter showcases some of the mechanisms by
which the mobile sector can support entrepreneurship and
job creation, with the aim of informing policy-makers,
investors, and entrepreneurs themselves. Some of these
approaches share similarities with traditional donor initia-
tives, but many are novel ideas for which the “proof of
concept” has been demonstrated only recently. In an indus-
try evolving as quickly as the mobile sector is today, it is vital
to tailor support to the local circumstances and to evaluate
impact regularly. As a framework for entrepreneurial activi-
ties, the chapter examines open innovation, and considers
one particular way of supporting entrepreneurial activity in
the mobile industry, namely, specialized business incubators,
or mobile labs. The chapter reviews mobile microwork and
the potential of the virtual economy, and then reverses the
lens to consider mobile phones as a tool for job seekers.
Finally, it summarizes suggestions to support entrepreneur-
ship and job creation in the mobile industry.
Open innovation and mobile
entrepreneurship 
The rapid innovation in the mobile sector is creating uncer-
tainty and disruptive technological change, while lowering
barriers to entry and generating opportunities for small and
young firms and entrepreneurs.5 The rise of entrepreneurship
in the mobile industry is therefore unsurprising. The lack of
vertical integration and direct competition between opera-
tors, handset manufacturers, and content providers has
resulted in a complex environment of different technological
standards and innovation in business models, with ample
space for growing new businesses. New information-sharing
and collaboration practices that transcend the closed commu-
nication channels are characteristic of newly establishing
markets. Rapid information flow dynamics were present in
the early stages of other high-tech industries, including the
semiconductor industry in the 1970s, PC software in the
1980s, and the internet in the 1990s. 
In today’s open innovation model, partners, customers,
researchers, and even competitors are finding new ways to
collaborate in the product development process. The para-
digm of open innovation assumes that firms can, and
should, use external as well as internal ideas and paths to
market as they seek to advance their technology.6 Today, in
many sectors there is a need to complement internally
oriented, centralized approaches to research and develop-
ment (R&D) with more open, networked methods, because
useful knowledge has become more dispersed (both within
and outside firms), while the speed of doing business has
increased. Collaborative approaches to innovation also offer
new ways to create value, especially in fast-changing indus-
tries. To capitalize on fresh opportunities, innovators must
find ways to integrate their ideas, expertise, and skills with
those of others outside the organization to deliver the result
to the marketplace (Chesbrough 2003; Aldrich and Zimmer
1986; Teece and Ballinger 1987). 
One of the most promising areas for entrepreneurship is
in mobile software applications, where the barriers to
market entry for individual developers and small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) are generally low. Mobile apps
can be written by programmers working for device manu-
facturers, network operators, content providers, or software
development firms, and they can also be created directly by
individual freelance professionals. In emerging, as in more
developed markets, there is no “natural” place where appli-
cations originate; for the most part, network operators and
device manufacturers provide their own apps, with other
apps supplied to market directly by developers. This room
for independence allows developers who also have entrepre-
neurial ambitions to start their own apps-based businesses.
Many SMEs and individual entrepreneurs in the developing
76
Information and Communications for Development 2012

world offer their services at competitive rates compared with
those in rich countries, but the vast array of choices of plat-
forms and distribution models can be challenging to navi-
gate. For example, most apps for simple, low-end phones are
written for SMS (short message service), while apps for mid-
range devices often rely on mobile internet access and may
be written in Java or PHP programming languages. Smart-
phone applications can be written for the proprietary Apple
iOS, BlackBerry, or Windows platforms, or for the open
source Android, among other options. According to one
survey, in 2011 developers used an average of 3.2 platforms
concurrently, which was a 15 percent increase over 2012
(Vision Mobile 2011). While this growth may be interpreted
as an indication of low barriers to entry, it is, rather, a sign of
the necessity for developers to hone skills in multiple plat-
forms, because no one knows which of these platforms—if
any—will become dominant in the future. In other words,
developers choose to diversify their skills because the
market, at the moment, demands variety and flexibility.
Marketing and distributing dilemmas are especially chal-
lenging: app stores based on operating systems compete with
those managed by handset manufacturers and major global
brands, and programmers must decide which store, or
stores, will be most effective as a delivery vehicle of apps to
their potential customers. 
Informal industry networks for mobile 
entrepreneurship
The lack of formal information channels and uncertainty
mean that mobile entrepreneurs must keep up-to-date with
changes in standards and industry developments, resulting
in frequent socializing and informal networking between
mobile entrepreneurs and developers. Informal social
networks, consisting of acquaintances, mentors, investors as
well as other mobile entrepreneurs, or peers, serve three
distinct purposes in the development of new ventures—
discovering opportunities, securing new resources, and
obtaining legitimacy—all of which are necessary for the
survival of a young firm (Elfring and Hulsink 2003). Entre-
preneurs may have initiative, an appetite for risk, creative
ideas, and business acumen, but they may also need comple-
mentary resources to produce and deliver their goods or
services. Social networks are important sources of support
and knowledge and can provide access to distribution chan-
nels, capital, skills, and labor to start new business activities
(Greve and Salaff 2003).
One way to support jobs created through entrepreneurship
in an era of open innovation is through structured social
networking events that can help define business opportuni-
ties, identify talent, and draw investment into the mobile
sector in emerging markets. Networking events can also graft
best practice lessons from the ground back into the develop-
ment and donor communities. An early example of an infor-
mal social networking organization is Mobile Monday
(www.mobilemonday.net), an open community platform of
mobile entrepreneurs, developers, investors, and industry
enthusiasts. Mobile Monday fosters business opportunities
through live networking events. It provides a space for entre-
preneurs to demonstrate new products, share ideas, and discuss
trends from local and global markets. Founded in 2000, in
Helsinki, the community has grown to more than 100 city
chapters and is managed by 300 volunteers around the world.7
More narrowly focused organizations, such as Google
Technology User Groups (GTUGs) (www.gtugs.org), cater to
participants interested in a particular developer technology.
These groups provide training for developers using the open
Android mobile platform, followed by minimally structured
networking events.8 GTUGs vary in format, from a dozen
people who may get together to watch a corporate video, to
large groups involved in product demos, lectures, and compe-
titions dubbed “code sprints” and “hackathons.” Smaller, local
networks have also been formed in many cities. For instance,
Nairobi-based AkiraChix provides networking and training
for women and girls unfamiliar with software design. It culti-
vates the careers of young developers of both genders by
providing training in programming and mobile application
development (box 5.1). In Nepal Young Innovations, the
group behind the Kathmandu-based organization Mobile
Nepal, regularly hosts “bar camps”—open conferences where
entrepreneurs and developers give presentations and provide
feedback.9 In Georgia the business social network “mTbilisi”
promotes corporate partnerships, coordinates online and in-
person events focused on incubating mobile start-ups, and
provides a space for testing new ideas and designs. This proj-
ect aims to bridge the gap between online and mobile appli-
cation concepts—such as eCommerce applications, virtual
guides, informational bases, or search engines.10
Features and dynamics of informal networks of
entrepreneurs
Mobile developers and entrepreneurs interviewed for this
report identified both informal gatherings and more

structured social networking activities (as mentioned
above) as helpful to innovation and entrepreneurship in
the development of mobile applications. Respondents
from Kenya, Nepal, and Uganda indicated that they are
initially cautious about sharing ideas and information but
that they freely provide lessons and support once they are
established and have begun implementing their business
ideas.11 Entrepreneurs may first test options for starting
their own business within a circle of carefully selected
contacts. As a second step, during the planning stage,
entrepreneurs often mobilize a large, informal network of
friends, colleagues, mentors, and other acquaintances,
since they may not know who exactly can help them
(Berglund 2007). Information exchange in informal envi-
ronments carries risks for fragile new businesses, includ-
ing the threat of idea theft: promising ideas risk being
taken over not only by peers and direct competitors but
also by larger companies, which, instead of hiring the idea
generator to complete the work, may assign an internal
team to develop the project in-house. To mediate such risks,
once the project design stage has begun, entrepreneurs
choose smaller, trusted groups from a wider social network
to form product development teams. Entrepreneurs recog-
nize that without a plan for execution, an idea is irrele-
vant. Many individuals may recognize demand for a
specific product or service; however, it is execution that
“makes or breaks” an app. Developers and entrepreneurs
tend to rely on their informal networks to identify poten-
tial partners, mentors, or peers who can be consulted in
confidence and relied on to help move a viable product
from mind toward market. Once collaboration is under
way, individuals may come back to the network to talk
about their example of successful partnership and to share
challenges. In other words, the interaction pattern seems
to circle from a group setting to one-on-one interaction
and back to the wider network. 
The rewards of networking usually greatly outweigh the
risks. Many mobile entrepreneurs note that collaboration is
essential, because few applications can be successfully
brought to market by a single developer, let alone expanded
to additional platforms and maintained afterward. Market
information, idea validation, and partnerships are among
the most frequently cited rewards of participation in social
networks, according to more than 80 percent of participants
in our survey (figure 5.1). Access to finance (including small
amounts raised from friends and family) and mentorship
opportunities were other important rewards, listed by more
than 60 percent of respondents. Finally, marketing support
is another benefit of participating in informal peer groups.
On the risk side, more than 35 percent of respondents are

AkiraChix hosts informal gatherings, workshops, and competitions for mobile developers and
entrepreneurs in Kenya. In 2011 AkiraChix and iHub, a community of technology innovators in
Nairobi, partnered to host AppCircus, a traveling showcase of the most creative and innova-
tive apps. Twelve finalists were given the chance to pitch their mobile apps to an audience.
The overall winner was Msema Kweli, who developed a mobile app that helps keep track of
Community Development Fund projects. It uses data made available by the Kenyan govern-
ment through its Open Data Initiative to track spending and progress by constituency. Users
can then report and comment on different projects. The app can be adapted to increase trans-
parency and accountability for any community or development project. The first runner-up,
Martin Kasomo, developed Hewa App, a mobile cloud-based music marketing and distribution
platform for Kenyan artists and record labels to sell their music online. The jury highlighted the
ease of use of this app and its attempt to tackle the problem of local music distribution in
Kenya. Third place was claimed by Bernard Adongo of NikoHapa for a customer engagement
and promotions application for businesses, which relies on news-sharing and geolocation tools
to build a customer community.

concerned about idea theft, in particular by more established
businesses; however, even these entrepreneurs recognize the
necessity of vetting or validating ideas with their peers and
consider the risk of idea theft to be tolerable. Loss of time,
funds, and focus are concerns for 28 percent, 9 percent, and
7 percent of respondents, respectively.
The marketing of mobile applications is typically the
biggest expense and also the activity about which developers
are often the least enthusiastic. Developers often rely on
partners or enterprise customers for all aspects of market-
ing, which, if executed poorly, can stall the adoption of an
otherwise successful app. For small teams of developers
working on “mass market” apps, marketing strategies can
include dissemination and awareness-raising through word
of mouth, Twitter, Facebook, email, and SMS. Successful
incubators, such as iHub Nairobi,12 act as useful “amplifiers”
of marketing efforts, because local media and investors tend
to follow their announcements and activities closely.
Participants report that small groups (from 4 or 5 people
up to 20) are the most helpful form of networking in
discussing ideas and execution. Larger groups can be too
impersonal or too strongly driven by formal presen tations.
As a result, many organizers (including Mobile Monday
Kampala13) use breakout groups to ensure more meaning-
ful conversations at their events. Network sponsors can help
strengthen social networks by attracting well-known figures
or VIPs to the meetings, as much as by direct financial
support. Attracting respected experts to address attendees
can be helpful in drawing out participants and broadening
the number and scope of conversations within the network.
Mobile incubators
While the informal networks of mobile entrepreneurs and
developers described above can provide many resources,
including knowledge and connections to investors, demand
for more formal, hands-on learning spaces and supportive
office environments is also strong.14 A typical business incu-
bator may house 5 to 20 start-up companies in a shared
space offering common office equipment and conference
facilities. Most employ a resident manager who coordinates
business assistance, training, and other services, such as
business plan development; accounting, legal, and financial
advice; coaching and help in approaching investors; market-
ing; and shared services, such as administrative support.
Once a client or resident business is deemed financially
viable, it moves its operations outside the incubator, enters
the market, hires new staff, and expands its contribution to
the economy (Lewis 2001).
A number of incubators, or “labs,” focused on mobile
entrepreneurs have been established in emerging markets,
including Grameen Foundation’s AppLabs in Uganda and
Indonesia, and infoDev’s regional mobile applications labo-
ratories, or “mLabs.” (figure 5.2; box 5.2). Launched over the
past five years, these labs are still in an experimental stage,
but they offer several early lessons. Mobile labs  facilitate

In response to demand by local mobile entrepreneurs, the World Bank Group’s infoDev
program, in collaboration with the Government of Finland and Nokia, has established a
network of five mobile application labs, or mLabs, and eight mobile social networking hubs,
or mHubs. In Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda,
Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam, mLabs and mHubs facilitate demand-driven innovation by
grassroots entrepreneurs, so breakthrough low-cost, high-value applications can be devel-
oped. Each mLab is a technology-neutral physical space with testing facilities for developing
the technical skills and business sense needed to build scalable mobile solutions into thriv-
ing businesses that address social needs. As well as providing state-of-the-art equipment, the
labs offer technical training and workshops, and they connect developers and entrepreneurs
with potential investors, experts, and public sector leaders. The labs are complemented by
eight mHubs, which focus on bringing together various stakeholder communities in the
mobile industry and providing advice, mentorship, idea and product development competi-
tions, and access to investors through regular informal events and conferences. Both the
mLabs and mHubs are run and used by local communities working to increase the competi-
tiveness of enterprises in mobile content and applications and are part of a wider mobile inno-
vation program, seeking to develop talent and produce successful companies with strong
growth potential.

demand-driven innovation by grassroots entrepreneurs, so
breakthrough low-cost, high-value apps can be brought to
market. Although specialized incubators are not unusual,
those focusing solely on mobile app businesses are a recent
phenomenon. That presents both a challenge and an oppor-
tunity, because lessons and best practices can be borrowed
from related ventures, but ample opportunity exists to
develop new formats tailored to the mobile sector. Ideally,
mobile labs should be designed in a way that enables them
to remain open and adaptable to their environment, so
lessons can be incorporated continuously throughout the
lab’s existence.
Mobile lab managers identify their members’ greatest
needs as start-up capital and opportunities to network with
mobile ecosystem players and other technology entrepre-
neurs. In addition, many mobile app entrepreneurs need
specialized business training to understand the mobile
ecosystem, market demand, or both. Further, because
mobile app development needs a special set of technical abil-
ities, many app developers need specialized technical train-
ing to continuously update their programming skills.
Networking with local business professionals can enhance
the incubation experience, providing entrepreneurs with
highly customized advice that can accelerate the growth of
their business. Mobile labs can offer a wide range of services,
including “business accelerators”—intensive training and
direct mentoring meant to quickly increase the value of a
company and to help management develop a viable growth
strategy. In poor or remote areas, virtual incubation—
business training, advice, mentorship, and networking over
a distance and without a dedicated workspace, as well as
links with knowledgeable diaspora members—can be
particularly helpful. The service offerings implemented by
any given lab or incubator should reflect the environment
and characteristics of the region where it is located. These
characteristics often dictate the services that can be offered
and the most likely mix of revenue streams. Incubators may
be instituted as nonprofit organizations, for-profit compa-
nies (usually when they do not receive grant funding), or
foundations. The business models and legislation of a given
country usually dictate the most advantageous status for an
incubator. Regardless of the regulatory environment,
however, partners are essential to the ultimate success of a
mobile incubator through their support of the organiza-
tions’ development and distribution efforts. That is because,
ideally, the incubator sits near or at the center of the value
chain for mobile content creation and, in its role as an inte-
grator, brokers essential partnerships with all key mobile
ecosystem players (Vital Wave Consulting 2011).
Even in developed countries, mobile incubators are a
recent phenomenon. In the United States the prominent
mobile incubator Tandem Entrepreneurs was launched in
2011 to enable a group of experienced entrepreneurs to
provide resources and mentorship to early-stage mobile
start-ups. The incubator also offers each resident company
seed funds and a collaborative workspace in Silicon Valley.15
As mobile services become more sophisticated and wide-
spread, the potential of mobile entrepreneurs to contribute to
the economies of both developed and developing countries is
likely to grow. Most businesses based around mobile app
technology are at an early stage of development but may offer
enormous employment and economic potential, similar to
that of the software industry in the early 1980s. Supporting
networking and incubation of entrepreneurs in this space is
an important way to ensure such potential is tapped.
Mobile microwork
New employment opportunities in mobile communications
are not restricted to highly skilled developers and entrepre-
neurs but can also extend to a relatively low-skilled labor
force. “Microwork” refers to small digital tasks (such as tran-
scribing hand-written text or determining whether two
photos show the same building). Typically, such tasks can be
completed in a few seconds by a person without special skills
or training, but they cannot be readily automated. Workers
are paid small amounts of money for completing each task.
For such work to be broadly accessible to workers from
developing countries, it should be performed via mobile
devices as well as PCs. The mobile microwork market is still
very much in its infancy, however (box 5.3).
Currently, microwork employs more than 100,000
people and contributes to a virtual global economy valued
at $3 billion a year, according to a recent infoDev study
(Lehdonvirta and Ernkvist 2011). To understand how a
mobile user may be able to tap into additional sources of
income, consider, for instance, the growing gaming indus-
try, which enables online gamers to become microworkers
compensated in virtual game currency that can often be
cashed in for real monetary gains. Today’s online game
Mobile Entrepreneurship and Employment
81

market is very competitive, with monthly subscription fees
for some games nearing zero. Instead of charging players,
leading online game producers can earn revenue by selling
virtual currency to players. The players buy virtual goods
and value-added services inside the game using virtual
currency. Third parties—monetization service providers—
facilitate the exchange of real money into virtual funds. Two
such monetization services providers, Gambit and TrialPay,
allow gamers to pay for purchases by carrying out micro-
tasks. After completing assigned microwork, the player is
paid in virtual currency, which can be traded for virtual
goods or converted to real money.
Because virtual workers come from a global pool, inter-
national microwork aggregators must be able to provide
compensation in foreign countries. This is complex in any
market, but it is especially challenging in developing regions,
where traditional financial infrastructure can be limited.
Mobile money schemes, which are more advanced in devel-
oping than developed countries, provide a viable option for
payment for microwork via mobile phones (box 5.4).
Leila Chirayath Janah of Samasource works with refugees
in Dadaab, Kenya, who are paid for performing small tasks
for Samasource’s clients, including Google and CISCO. She
suggests that microwork may be a natural complement to
microfinance, noting that, whereas microfinance can enable
entrepreneurs to operate small businesses serving local needs
(such as producing chickens on a small farm), microwork
allows them to reach beyond the local market and develop a
variety of skills. Samasource now facilitates virtual assistance
via microwork, including for clients from the developed
world. Janah also notes that, while typical microwork tasks
are not necessarily intellectually  stimulating, they encourage
interaction with technology and access to global online
social networks, which is “vital to having a voice in the
modern world.”16
Although third-party gaming services have existed for
more than a decade, the general microwork industry
remains relatively new and undeveloped, with mobile
microwork in an even earlier stage of development. And
despite the relative simplicity of tasks required, microwork
faces the challenge of breaking down larger business proce-
dures or analytical problems into smaller components that
can be executed by microworkers. This is a technical, as well
as procedural, problem that warrants further research by the
development and business communities alike. A number of
new ventures are considering potential solutions, in the hope
of entering a market that is likely to grow into billions of
dollars a year over the next five years. Easier-to-use interfaces
and better distribution channels are also needed, if mobile
microwork is to prove a viable employment option for some
of the poorest and least educated workers in developing
countries (Lehdonvirta and Ernkvist 2011).
Mobiles and recruitment
In many countries, coordination and information failures
arise between the demand and supply sides of the labor
market. While the demand for employment exists both in the
formal and informal sectors, information on recruitment is
often limited to those with a strong social network or access to
job postings via the internet. The mobile phone can extend
this access to those job providers or job seekers for whom PCs
are an ineffective or unavailable channel of exchange. A
number of emerging business models are using mobile
communications for improving coordination and informa-
tion flows in the labor market. At least four such services are
82

JANA, a service developed originally by Nathan Eagle as TxtEagle, relies on SMS to connect
users to a wide range of more complex media and communication technologies. It also acts
as an aggregator of microwork tasks and assigns workers tasks that can be completed on a
mobile phone, including, for example, data entry, translations, and transcriptions. With the help
of partnerships with 220 mobile operators in 80 countries, it then compensates workers with
mobile money or airtime minutes.

already up and running: Babajob (India), Assured Labor
(Latin America), LabourNet (India), and Souktel (Middle
East and North Africa, as profiled in box 5.5). Two others,
Pakistan Urban Link and Support (PULS) and Konbit (Haiti),
have developed their systems and will soon start operating. 
Skilled, educated workers may already have access to exist-
ing web-based job-matching services such as Monster.com,
but job-matching services that are mobile-based will be even
more important for people without access to web-based serv-
ices. Mobile-to-web technology will be beneficial for people
with a certain level of skills and education (that is, basic liter-
acy) but not enough knowledge to create a marketable
résumé or access online resources. Employers also find it hard
to identify low-skilled workers for entry-level jobs in devel-
oping countries, because existing job-matching services
mainly target highly skilled candidates. Mobile-to-web tech-
nology promises to bridge some of these gaps. 
Building trust among users is the most challenging task
for the job-matching business. Each of the new organiza-
tions mentioned above offers additional and customized
services to meet the specific needs of local users, including
interview, résumé writing, and networking skills training for
job seekers, and access to a special database for employers.
Depending on the job seeker’s target market and country of
operation, mobile phones may be used for different aspects
of the job-matching business process. Most of these organi-
zations use mobile phones for registration and job-match
notifications for job seekers. The actual job-matching ser -
vice is conducted mostly via web-based databases. 
Of course, such technology cannot fully replace the tradi-
tional interview process. Once employers become interested
in certain candidates, they can access job seekers’ informa-
tion and then contact them directly for an interview. Use of
SMS text messaging can be popular where its cost is signifi-
cantly lower than that of voice services; however, in multi-
lingual environments with illiterate populations, calls and
voicemail remain particularly valuable.
Perhaps the greatest impact of mobile communications
on jobs lies not so much on recruitment techniques, but
rather on the structure of employment. Beyond creating
more vacancy notices, mobiles can stimulate entrepre-
neurial activity, as the demand for mobile industry hubs
and mobile incubators has shown, and it can create many
more opportunities for self-employment, part-time work,
and flexwork. In a mobile-driven economy, second and
third jobs will become much more common—and much
more important. 
Conclusions and considerations 
for policy-makers
Overall, the rise of mobile technology carries great potential
for employment, but with increased reach of powerful and
affordable mobile devices, jobs may also be lost. Mobile
technology can occasionally eliminate jobs, especially where
efficiencies are created or resources made available that
replace human input. For example, as more individuals
acquire their own mobile phones, the demand for “village

Idea competitions can be an effective way to encourage creativity and identify the most prom-
ising product blueprints in a quickly innovating industry. To harness mobile microwork for devel-
opment, infoDev has organized the Mobile To Work (M2Work) challenge to developers to come
up with fresh thinking on ideas for microwork tasks that could be commissioned remotely to
create employment opportunities in the developing world. The challenge, published online on
February 1, 2012, at www.ideasproject.com/m2work, attracted some 944 proposals by the April
2 deadline. Prizes, sponsored by UKaid and the Department for Foreign Affairs of the Govern-
ment of Finland and worth up to $40,000, are being awarded to the best ideas. The overall
winning proposal, submitted by Aadhar Bhalinge of India, suggests a smart rickshaw network to
crowdsource maps at a very low cost in developing nations by employing fleets of rickshaw driv-
ers to feed live traffic updates into a subscription service. The regional winners also will benefit
from mentorship and a hackathon designed to turn the best ideas into functional applications.

Founded in 2005 by graduate fellows at Harvard University, MIT, and the Arab-American
University of Jenin (West Bank and Gaza), Souktel launched a trial service in 2007. Within a
year, over 100 of the 400 new college graduates who participated in the pilot found work or
internships, and more than three-fifths of employers who used this service cut their recruiting
time and costs by up to half. With a $100,000 grant from the World Bank Group, the service
has been launched at three more college campuses in partnership with the Ministry of Educa-
tion, then franchised in Morocco, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates; and it is expected to
launch in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Rwanda.
Leveraging the high penetration rate of mobile phones, Souktel developed a job informa-
tion software platform to connect job seekers with employers via a mobile device. One of the
unique characteristics of Souktel is its franchise business model. Souktel has used this model
to achieve a rapid growth in new markets. Each country uses a customized version of the
JobMatch platform for a franchise fee and a recurrent annual support fee. In return, per-use
revenue from local user fees charged to job seekers and employers accrue to the franchisee,
helping to ensure each franchise’s long-term cost coverage and sustainability. 
As a way of measuring its impact, Souktel uses weekly database tracking of service use
(searches, match requests, job alerts); monthly phone surveys of “matched” job seekers and
employers; and bi-annual “match retention” phone surveys and institutional partner surveys.
Positive outcomes are observed in the reduction of time spent looking for employment (from
an average of 12 weeks to 1 week or less), wage increases (64 percent of matched job seek-
ers in the West Bank and Palestine surveyed in 2009 reported a 50 percent increase in aver-
age monthly wages, from $500 a month to $750 a month), and a reduction in hiring costs and
time (70 percent of West Bank and Gaza employers surveyed in 2009 reported a 50 percent
reduction in hiring costs and time, while 75 percent of the same sample confirmed a mean
5 percent increase in annual profits). Challenges have included working with the different
mobile carriers. The cost of SMS, which averages about $0.05 a message in the West Bank
and Gaza, is also a barrier to wider usage.

phones,” teleshops, and other phone-sharing services may
disappear in many countries (matching the demise of public
payphones in many countries, following the widespread
adoption of mobile phones), taking away with it an impor-
tant source of jobs. In sum, however, with growing mobile
penetration rates, the mobile industry is widely expected to
produce a net increase in jobs:
• The direct number of jobs in the mobile industry from
1996 to 2011, as reported by governments to the ITU,
shows a clear upward trend in most (although not all)
countries (ITU 2011).
• As the adoption of mobile technology increases, new jobs
are needed to support sales of prepaid cell phone
minutes, mobile money transactions, and other mobile-
based services. 
• The introduction of mobile broadband is expected to
generate significant revenues and jobs, especially in
related spin-off industries, including the development of
mobile applications. 
• Nontraditional business plans (such as those based on
microwork) are another source of potential growth in
jobs enabled by mobile technologies. 
• The labor market can benefit from the ability of mobile
apps to improve efficiency and lower costs in matching
job candidates and employers. 
This chapter has outlined a number of tools for enabling
growth of employment opportunities in the mobile ecosys-
tem, including: 
• Supporting informal community networks and activities
such as business competitions and hackathons to
promote open collaboration, mentorship, and introduc-
tion of entrepreneurs and investors, and to identify viable
new business ideas 
• Investing in mobile hubs and incubators, or mobile labs,
in order to equip entrepreneurs with updated technical
skills, to provide them with tools necessary for product
prototyping such as testing facilities, and to identify busi-
nesses with growth potential through business evaluation
and acceleration programs 
• Facilitating creation of micro- and virtual work opportu-
nities
• Investing in better mobile platforms for recruiters and
job seekers as well as platforms that extend work beyond
traditional work spaces and times
To capitalize on the potential of mobile technologies to
support entrepreneurship and employment, policy-makers
may consider whether current regulation supports an
enabling environment for mobile broadband and entrepre-
neurship, whether to provide financial support for entrepre-
neurs and incubation systems, and whether to incorporate
some of the aforementioned tools in their public service
offerings, such as schools and vocational training institu-
tions, in order to increase employment opportunities in the
mobile ecosystem.

been shown in numerous studies that provide a framework of
dual causality between a strong period of entrepreneurship
and a growing and rapidly innovating economy. See, for

overnments around the world, in varying
stages of economic development and with
diverse technological and institutional capaci-
ties, are adopting or investigating mobile government
(mGovernment). Several examples of how civil society, the
private sector, and entrepreneurs are delivering service
improvements using mobile tools have been discussed in
chapters 2–5. This chapter focuses on how mobile tools are
helping governments to deliver public services more
widely and to improve processes of governance. 
Yet, the mere introduction of mobile tools cannot
serve as a panacea for structural deficiencies in govern-
ments’ capacities or processes. Initial experiences suggest
that the benefits of mGovernment will likely accrue to
those governments that put in place policies and
programs that not only enable technological transforma-
tion but also promote needed institutional reforms and
process redesign. The increased demand for services and
governance stimulated by this technological transforma-
tion will require an increased capacity to supply those
services and improve governance. Recognizing the rapid
evolution of the field, this chapter identifies some emerg-
ing best practice policies and programs that could
support the technological transformation and needed
institutional capacity development to unlock the benefits
of mGovernment. 
A typology of mGovernment
Mobile government involves using mobile tools to change
either the interactions between users and government or the
processes of government. In 2012 tools in use include mobile
networks (such as broadband, Wi-Fi, and voice-centric),
mobile devices (tablets, smartphones, featurephones), their
associated technologies (voice calling, SMS text messaging,
location detection, internet access), and software in the form
of network services and applications.
Mobile government matters because it has the potential
to liberate users from the physical or location-related
constraints inherent in conventional service delivery and
traditional electronic government (eGovernment) services.
With more than 6 billion mobile telephone subscriptions
worldwide in early 2012, and more than four-fifths of the
world’s population covered by mobile telephone networks,
mGovernment can make public services and processes avail-
able and accessible just about anywhere, at anytime, to
almost anyone.
Table 6.1 summarizes three forms of mGovernment.
Typically, governments adopt a combination of these three
types to achieve their service delivery and governance objec-
tives, and in so doing, provide accountability, transparency,
and responsiveness to their citizens. First, mobile tools can
be used to supplement existing eGovernment applications

Definition
Mobile tools add a channel to
existing eGovernment services
and processes.
Mobile tools allow conven-
tional services to reach previ-
ously un- or underserved
constituents.
Mobile tools are used to develop
new services for service delivery
and governance.
Example
The Republic of Korea with
widespread e-Government, 
has added wireless portals and
interfaces to e-services (such 
as transport tickets, renewals,
confirmations).a
Bangladesh’s Health Line
provides citizens with medical
advice through a telephone
hotline, cutting travel time and
waiting at health centers.b
In the Democratic Republic of
Congo, mobile tools allow citizens
to participate in budgeting, by
voting on how to spend local
budgets.c
Opportunities
Mobile devices, which are
more widespread than tradi-
tional computers, connect
more citizens to existing 
e-services.
Widespread mobile tools allow
conventional services to reach
previously excluded citizens
including the poor, rural popu-
lations, and people with
disabilities.
Combined innovation in technol-
ogy and government processes
creates new opportunities for citi-
zens to engage with and hold
government accountable.
Limitations
Full advantage is not taken of
unique capabilities of mobile
tools (such as location deter-
mination, built-in cameras);
limited to existing eGovern-
ment services.
Benefits are limited by the
design and nature of the
conventional service and 
institution; do not necessarily
improve the government-citizen
relationship.
Extent of innovation depends on
local political, economic, and
capacity constraints; might need
more time to deploy.
Implications for government
Marginal: related to being able
to provide any related “physi-
cal” service at the needed
location and time.
Moderate to significant:
government capacity needs to
grow to serve more citizens;
may need process re-engineer-
Significant: needs changes to
government processes, creating
response capacity.

based on traditional personal computers (PCs), adding a
new channel to reach citizens or manage processes of gover-
nance. Supplementary mGovernment adds the dimension of
mobility to existing electronic services. 
Second, mobile tools can expand the reach of conven-
tional public services or government processes to citizens
who are unserved or underserved, often because of their
remote location or the nonavailability of PCs and internet
access. Broad mobile coverage and widespread access to and
familiarity with mobile telephones, give governments the
opportunity to reach people who might not otherwise have
easy access to these public services and processes. These two
types—supplementary and expansionary—are also instru-
mental, focusing more on the “mobile” in mGovernment. 
Third, mGovernment can use the introduction of mobile
tools to innovate new ways for governments to interact with
and involve constituents, creating new types of services and
governance processes. Innovative mGovernment programs
intend to change not only the technology of interaction but
also the nature of service delivery or the process. For example,
they allow participatory budgeting1 and community mapping
of infrastructure and services.2 Experiments in mobile-enabled
mapping by urban slum dwellers, for example, suggest that
innovative mGovernment could actually transform govern-
ments’ design process for urban development programs by
directly involving beneficiaries.3 Possibilities like these have
profound implications for innovative mGovernment. 
Although the specific form of a service will vary depending
on the availability or advancement of technology, govern-
ments could use these different types of mobile services
regardless of the technical base or socioeconomic status. In
the case of transformative mGovernment, for example, appli-
cations using smartphones or basic devices can allow citizens
to report nonemergency municipal problems, track respon-
siveness, and participate in virtual social spaces to put pres-
sure on municipalities to address community issues.4
There are some limits on what might be possible to
accomplish on a mobile device with a smaller screen or less
powerful computing capability than a traditional personal
computer has; more traditional eGovernment services will

thus continue to have an important role. Both the design of
mobile devices as well as their (and networks’) capabilities
are constantly evolving, however, and the future might see
more powerful mGovernment services working alongside,
or as replacements for, traditional eGovernment services.
Governments will thus need to consider carefully which
services can make the transition to mobile, weighing the
capabilities of both users and technologies in the process.
Drivers for mGovernment
Why have local, provincial, and national governments and
public agencies around the world become interested in
mGovernment? Experience thus far suggests that two sets of
factors are driving governments to look at mGovernment:
global developments that create the environment for
governments to consider mobile tools, and the opportunity
mGovernment offers to governments seeking to improve
service delivery and promote good governance.
Global developments
Three sets of global developments are creating an environ-
ment in which mGovernment has become relevant. These
are the creation of the underlying technology base in the
form of mobile networks and devices, deepening innovation
in mobile applications and services, and shifts in the ability
of citizens to voice their demands using these technologies
combined with increasing pressure on governments to
respond to those demands.
First, as chapter 1 shows, mobile networks are spreading
even as devices become ever more capable. Mobile networks
now have the capacity to deliver a mix of voice, audio-visual,
and data services, creating an opportunity for governments
to reach more citizens and offer new services through other
than conventional means. And while the vast majority of the
world’s population now uses basic mobile telephones, more
powerful mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are
being increasingly adopted (Hellstrom 2008). 
Second, as illustrated in chapters 2–5, there is tremen-
dous growth in innovation in the development of applica-
tions and services that use mobile technologies. While
initial innovation focused on commercial and entertain-
ment applications, more recently there has been a rapid
increase in innovative mobile applications and services for
social or economic development (Qiang et al. 2012a, b). A
growing list of individuals, cooperatives, not-for-profit and
nongovernmental organizations, private firms, and public
agencies are experimenting with and using mobile applica-
tions and services in interesting ways (OECD and ITU 2011;
UNDP 2012). As the frontier of innovation begins to touch
many public services, it often compels or encourages
governments to experiment with these technologies.
Third, individuals have begun to harness these technolo-
gies and applications to voice their demands, mobilize
communities, and engage with various levels of govern-
ments (box 6.1). Even if the results of such efforts vary,5
combined with ongoing global political and economic
transformations in recent years, this voiced demand for
responsive services and good governance by citizens through
alternative means has increased pressure on some govern-
ments to respond.
Because these developments affect different governments
in different ways, the speed with which governments adopt
mobile tools is certain to vary. Yet, as the subsequent exam-
ples illustrate, few governments at any level anywhere in the
world are not interested in going mobile (OECD and ITU
2011, 119–50).
The opportunity of mGovernment
In comparison with the growing volume of evidence on the
benefits of eGovernment (infoDev 2009; Hanna 2010), the
impact of many mGovernment services is still unknown.
Even without clear evidence of the benefits, many govern-
ments nonetheless have begun to explore the possibility of
mGovernment if only in low-risk or limited ways. A small
number of governments are undertaking major efforts to
mainstream mobile tools in service delivery and governance.
This section describes some of the more sector- or function-
specific examples first, beginning with a discussion of citi-
zen-facing examples and following with examples of internal
process-oriented tools. It then discusses broader and, in
some cases, government-wide initiatives. 
Sector- or function-specific programs. There are many
examples of sector- or function-specific mGovernment
programs. The simplest ones use mobile tools as a means for
government to reach citizens to provide information or
simple services or to coordinate internal processes. 
Common examples are emergency notifications for
adverse weather events or for changes to water or energy
supplies. Moldova’s Ministry of Agriculture and Food Indus-
tries is working with a local agriculture cooperative to pilot

Information and Communications for Development 2012
Mobile devices, especially mobile telephones, have become important tools for citizens to
express their opinions, mobilize groups, and report on events as they unfold (UNDP 2012).
Although mobile telephones and associated applications cannot substitute for community
mobilization and democratic processes, they can and have played a role in organizing citizens,
especially through social media such as Facebook and Twitter (Brisson and Krontiris 2012).
Perhaps the best-known example is the Ushahidi platform, which emerged in Kenya in
response to the violence that erupted after the 2007 election. Ushahidi has now become an
open source platform that anyone
may use to create an incident-
reporting system, by crowdsourc-
ing information using multiple
channels such as SMS, email, Twit-
ter, and the web. The information is
used to create a map of events to
give users a visual image of event
hotspots. It has been applied in
circumstances as diverse as elec-
tion monitoring, disaster recovery,
and crime reporting. 
More recently, feature- and smart-
phones have been used widely in the
ongoing political changes in the
Middle East. Citizens have collected
and disseminated information during
recent events in Egypt, for example,
through mobile-based tools includ -
ing SMS, and for users with more
sophisticated devices, through Twit-
ter and YouTube (see chapter 1).

an adverse weather alert service for farmers.6 Similar exam-
ples come from Malaysia and the United States, where SMS
is used to alert citizens about limited drinking water supplies
or energy blackouts (OECD and ITU 2011). A number of
educational systems use SMS to provide students with
examination results. The state of Kerala in India has used
SMS to send students examination results on request since
2010, reducing the need to wait in queues.7
Mobile tools have also shown potential in cutting out
intermediaries while improving broader economic outcomes.
In Bangladesh, sugarcane farmers now receive an SMS telling
them when they should bring their product to sugar mills. In
the conventional system, a paper notification might either be
misplaced or misdirected by rent-seeking intermediaries.
After a successful trial, this system, e-Purjee, was extended to
about 200,000 farmers and all 15 of the country’s state-
owned sugarcane mills, and a feature was added alerting
 farmers when their payment was ready. Sugar production
rose 62 percent following the introduction of e-Purjee, and
farmers are benefiting from a more transparent system.8
Integration with mobile-based payment systems offers
consumers of public resources the opportunity to pay for
services anytime and any where and also simplifies revenue
collection for governments. Many cities in Europe and the
Sources: Stauffacher, Hattotuwa, and Weekes 2012; http://ushahidi.com/about-us; UNDP 2012.

United States have integrated payment for parking or trans-
port services into mobile applications. In Bangladesh
students can also apply for their university entrance exami-
nations through SMS, reducing the need for them to travel
to the university to submit an application. Fees are deducted
from the applicant’s mobile phone account. Following a
successful pilot, 28 postsecondary educational institutions
implemented the system in 2010.9 Qatar’s Hukoomi service
allows citizens to access and pay for a range of services
through their smartphone or computer, including utility
bills and parking or traffic fines.10 Complaint reporting
through mobile-based SMS has also been expanding
throughout the world. 
Mobile government efforts have made use of mobile’s
potential for wider citizen engagement and participation to
strengthen accountability and transparency in public ser -
vices and processes. These efforts are typically innovative,
because they often change the delivery or management of a
conventional service or process. For instance, the Depart-
ment of Education in the Philippines worked with the Affil-
iated Network for Social Accountability in East Asia and the
Pacific to set up a website called checkmyschool.org. This is a
government-to-citizen online and mobile-based interactive
tool that allows citizens to view pertinent statistics on local
schools. The site includes budget allocations, teacher and
textbook information, and test scores for about one-fifth of
the 44,000 schools in the country. It also gives local teachers
and parents a public place to post areas of concern that they
feel need to be addressed. All users are able to view the
government’s responses to these posts. Seeking to improve
education service delivery through transparent and account-
able behavior by school staff, checkmyschool.org has
increased community participation and vigilance and
improved teacher behavior.11
Municipalities and local police departments have begun
to use mobile tools to innovate and encourage citizen
participation in incident and issue reporting and tracking.
Guerrero, Mexico, was able to cut response times to citizen
complaints from 72 hours to 24 hours using Citivox.12 This
service provides real-time report management, crowd-
sourcing reports from people using mobile telephones to
register complaints or opinions on everything from simple
municipal issues to violent crimes. Follow-up by public
agencies has led to wider citizen participation in the serv-
ice.13 Similarly, cities across the United States are saving
time and money with SeeClickFix, a citizen-reporting tool
that allows people to geo-tag nonemergency municipal
issues, such as potholes or graffiti, with their mobile
phones.14 With more than 57,000 incidents reported and a
45 percent fix rate between January and October 2010
across multiple cities, this application shows promise for
efficient and streamlined citizen-government interactions. 
Public agencies are also using mobile tools to support
internal functions and to improve resource and program
management. For example, electricity companies are begin-
ning to use mobile networks to get real-time consumption
data from wireless-equipped smart meters.15 This will allow
electricity networks and consumers to be better informed
about consumption patterns, enabling new tariff models. 
Governments are beginning to use mobile tools to
manage resources more efficiently. Liberia’s water resource
management plan seeks to improve access to the half of the
rural population that does not have access to potable water.
The public works ministry deployed 150 data collectors to
map all of its roughly 7,500 publicly accessible water points
with a mobile geo-tagging and monitoring tool called
FLOW (Field Level Operations Watch). The process gave
the ministry a visualization of the status of water points,
allowing an updated needs assessment and leading to more
effective resource allocation.16
The possibility of using location sensing, either through
global positioning systems (GPS) embedded in devices or by
using mobile networks, has also created new service possi-
bilities. In the city of Cebu, in the Philippines, taxi drivers are
using GPS-enabled mobile phones to receive traffic data and
dispatch information. The data is used to generate maps in
real-time that identify areas with traffic congestion and to
generate traffic volume estimates.17
Cities are also using mobile devices to monitor the status
of ongoing programs. Auckland, New Zealand, piloted a
project with Municipal Reporter, a GPS-based handheld
system that allows the city to monitor its employees and
resources. The handheld monitors are saving the city more
than over 30 person-hours a week on highway maintenance
work. Auckland is currently in the process of shifting all
maintenance management to a GPS-based system. Such
tools also can help monitor programs in difficult security or
climatic conditions. For example, similar technologies, using
GPS-enabled smartphones, have been used in Afghanistan
to monitor the quality and progress of road construction.18

91

It is also possible to embed unique identifiers in physical
objects that mobile phones can recognize (Gartner 2011).
Such tools can allow citizens, for instance, to report a broken
streetlamp or park bench; officials can then use the same
technology to monitor repairs.
Civil society or international agencies have also used plat-
forms to support government service delivery by improving
efficiency and reducing waste. For example, UNICEF created
a mobile-based data collection tool called Rapid SMS (see
box 3.2 in chapter 3).19 In Hong Kong SAR, China, the Mobile
Field Inspection System enables inspectors to use touch-
screen PDAs (personal digital assistants) to enter inspection
information at the scene, as well as to review the results of
past inspections. Inspectors can send their reports through
their mobile phones without going to the office. The PDAs
were designed for easy use to shorten the training time.
Some of the benefits include an approximate 10 percent
increase in productivity, a 1.5-hour daily timesaving per
inspection team, and elimination of duplicate work.20
The wide range of countries and sectors covered in this
short list of examples is evidence of the growing interest in
and use of mobile tools by governments at different levels
and in varying stages of economic development. These exam-
ples also display a range of implementation arrangements.
In some cases, such as with FLOW in Liberia, projects have
been initiated by single agencies. In other cases, multiple
partners come together to deploy the tool and respond to
citizens’ demands. An example is SeeClickFix, where the
responsibility of complaint registration, traditionally a
government function, is shared between a private organiza-
tion and the city municipality. Governments adopt these
services because they involve and engage citizens in incident
and problem reporting through a third party, building trust
and credibility. At the same time, such services also build
pressure on governments to perform, opening government
processes to public scrutiny. 
Government-wide initiatives. Apart from the many initia-
tives coming through bottom-up efforts, a few govern-
ments have also begun mainstreaming mGovernment in
a larger and more coordinated way, taking a top-down
approach in some cases. Some governments, such as that of
the state of Kerala in India (box 6.2), have started on such
coordination relatively early; others such as the Republic of
Korea have evolved to realize the need for such coordina-
tion (box 6.3).
Such government-wide initiatives span the range from
having an overall mGovernment strategy for mobile services
to creating facilities for multiple government agencies to use
to deploy services. Countries as diverse as Afghanistan,
India,21 and the United States22 have been developing
mobile-specific strategies that address issues such as how to
align activities across agencies, encourage innovation within
an overall technical or process framework, and support the
development and delivery of services. Other countries have
incorporated mobility in their overall ICT strategies. For
example, Singapore’s government has already deployed
more than 300 mGovernment services and has plans, as part
of the Singapore eGovernment master plan to create “more
feature-rich and innovative mobile services” between 2011
and 2015.23 Similarly, the U.K. government has identified
mobile technologies as an area for attention in its Govern-
ment ICT Strategy of 2011.24
Some governments have also begun to create shared facil-
ities that may be used by multiple agencies. These facilities
are similar to those run by private firms that offer news,
entertainment, or information services. A number of
governments have developed shared services platforms that
give citizens access through a common entry point to a range
of services. Such platforms allow costs to be shared across
multiple agencies, consolidate demand for telecommunica-
tions services, and focus human capacity. The governments
of Jordan25 and of the state of Kerala in India (see box 6.2),
for example, have implemented shared services platforms
that deliver a wide range of SMS, interactive voice response
(IVR), or simple text-data services that citizens access using
a short code. Among the less developed countries, the
government of Afghanistan is also planning to set up a
government-wide mobile services delivery platform, which
will allow government services to reach the half of all Afghan
households that have mobile phones; for many the phone
would become the first medium for regular interaction with
the government.26
In countries where smartphones are common, govern-
ments have begun to create points of entry such as mobile
sites (the United Kingdom’s direct.gov, for example27) or
even government “app stores.” Such facilities allow
 citizens easy discovery, access, and use of mGovernment
applications. In 2010 the U.S. government created such
an app store with the intention of making it easy for
 citizens to access information and services using their
smartphones.28
92
Information and Communications for Development 2012

Having such coordinated and broader approaches to
mGovernment does not mean that governments should or
will need to stop bottom-up or innovative application
development. Governments will need to encourage quick
deployment of innovative applications when the demand
arises. Moreover, as the U.S. government’s draft federal
mobile strategy indicates, one size does not fit all, and there
will be a need to accommodate agency-specific programs.
Such coordination should enable innovation by guiding the
choice of technical standards and providing facilities where
needed.
Challenges for governments
Two key challenges for governments seeking to implement
mGovernment are to enable the technology transformation
and to respond increased demand for services and good
governance.
Making Government Mobile
93
The southern Indian state of Kerala has a population of 33 million. Leveraging the wide use
of mobile telephones, the Kerala State IT Mission (KSITM) leads a province-level mGovern-
ment program. The objective was to allow equitable access and enable social impact by
reaching people with mobile devices, rather than only those who are able to afford and
access computer-based internet services.
The centerpiece in Kerala’s m-Government architecture is a common service delivery plat-
form (SDP) that integrates various channels such as voice, data, and SMS. The KSITM manages
the SDP, supervising a private firm, MobMe, which set up the SDP. All government depart-
ments can access the SDP to enable the cost-effective design, development, and deployment
of various mGovernment applications. This arrangement avoids duplication of effort and cuts
capital spending on stand-alone systems. By integrating with all telecommunication companies,
the SDP eliminates the need for individual coordination by government agencies. The KSITM
also provides technical assistance to public departments to design and launch mobile applica-
tions.
Services include a common “short code” for the government (citizens dial KERALA or
537252 to access services). The service has created an additional incentive for the govern-
ment to offer services relevant to consumers, including citizen voting on a social reality show
where village governments present their successes, posting scores for major exams, and
processing movie and bus ticket reservations. The KSITM has also set up an electronic SMS
(eSMS) gateway for various government departments to communicate throughout their own
units and departments and across institutions. An interactive voice response system supports
government customer service call centers and was used to conduct an energy availability
survey. A Mobile Crime and Accident Reporting Platform has been used by Keralan police to
enhance public safety and law and order. Now, the state is looking to adopt a mobile payments
platform, so citizens can pay government fees from their handsets. The state continues to
improve and scale up initial mobile applications, such as multimedia messaging service-based
accident and crime reporting.
Since its launch in December 2010, the program has involved more than 60 government
agencies, facilitated more than 3 million interactions between the government and citizens,
deployed at least 20 mGovernment applications, and captured some 200,000 photos for crime
and accident reporting purposes. As the KSITM sees it, this is a start to shifting government-
citizen interactions from “red tape” to a “red carpet.”
Yet, the state faces various challenges in using mobile technology to create transformative
change. Successful applications for citizen participatory monitoring and reporting remain elusive.
Other key challenges are the low resource and process capacity of public agencies, which limit
the ability of the state to respond or improve its accountability.
Box 6.2 Kerala’s mobile government program

Enabling the technology 
transformation
Governments that are interested in mGovernment will need
to ensure that mobile tools are widely available to citizens,
that public agencies are ready and able to adopt these tech-
nologies, and that the ecosystem of applications and services
developers is in place to deliver needed services.
Simple mobile telephones are now commonplace across
the world, and mobile networks are widespread. However,
governments will need to ensure that the populations or
geographies they wish to target are adequately covered. This
issue is especially important if technology choices are more
sophisticated—using feature- or smartphones, for exam-
ple—because mismatches could keep citizens from accessing
public services.
Public agencies will also need to have the ability to adopt
these technologies. In many countries, that is likely to
involve closing gaps in technological or human capacity,
ensuring financial sustainability, and overcoming political or
bureaucratic resistance. These considerations are similar to
those seen for eGovernment services in the past, and indeed,
such factors limited the adoption of many of those programs
and reduced their long-term impact.
Many developing country governments are not in a
position to carry out mobile applications development on
their own, so it will be critical for them to work with part-
ners in the private or nonprofit sector. In some cases, coun-
tries have local technology companies that could develop
and even manage mGovernment applications. Many
governments might face a shortage of talent in applications
 development, however, or might not easily find willing
partners. Such constraints might slow down  mGovernment
efforts or increase costs if nonlocal resources have to be
called upon.
Creating institutional capacity
Even if mGovernment gains widespread acceptance,
concerns remain about the increased demand for respon-
sive services and good governance. It is thus important to
match technological progress with increases in institu-
tional capacity and, depending on the scale of change,
possibly to restructure government. Institutional capacity
is a greater issue with mGovernment than eGovernment
because of the wider reach of mobile tools and conse-
quently the larger number of citizens that likely would
use such tools.
True transformation needs governments to pay close
attention to re-engineering processes, reforming institu-
tions, and creating an environment for greater accounta -
bility and transparency. Such major shifts often need
significant political leadership and capital to implement,
and they inevitably take time. At the very least, governments
should have the institutional capacity in place to respond to
citizen demands because the move to mobile exponentially
increases the capacity for citizens to demand services and
good governance.
94
Information and Communications for Development 2012
By 2011 government agencies in the Republic of Korea had launched more than 160 mobile
applications covering internal processes, access to information, and public service delivery.
Problems soon emerged, however, because the applications lacked a common framework. As
a result, there was a redundant development of products, mismatch of technical standards
across ministries and agencies, and the lack of a clear direction for budget priorities around
mGovernment services. 
To address these challenges, the government in 2011 launched a five-year, $55 million strat-
egy to integrate mGovernment, focusing on both internal processes and public services. This
strategy establishes a common framework for developing simple mobile websites, hybrid
websites customizable by operating system, and mobile applications. For each of the five years,
the strategy sets priorities ranging from security to quality assurance and authentication, to the
establishment of a mobile common data management system. It also provides a detailed guide
to the user interfaces and experiences with mobile government websites. 
Box 6.3 Evolving toward coordination: the case of the Republic of Korea

As Ben Berkowitz, the co-founder of SeeClickFix,
explains, “The most important part of the process is the
‘fix.’ Without that, the incentive for participation disap-
pears.”29 Echoing a similar sentiment, Lishoy Bhaskar, vice
president at MobMe—the implementer of the Kerala
shared service delivery platform—finds that many govern-
ment officials in the developing world understand the
benefits of mGovernment but often hesitate to implement
it because “there is no one to fix the potholes even if they
are reported.”30
The risk in not responding is that citizens will quickly
lose trust and interest in participating in mGovernment
programs. This risk extends not only to those programs that
propose to make governance transparent and accountable
but also to those where technologies are supposed to
improve service quality by reducing wait times or simplify-
ing processes. If a government is unable to follow up on the
expansion of service—for example, by being unable to serve
the increased number of patients that show up at health clin-
ics because of better information on medical conditions—it
risks losing credibility.
Emerging best practices for going
mobile
How might governments respond to the challenges inherent
in going mobile? Emerging best practices—summarized in
this section and in table 6.2—suggest a range of actions
governments could take to boost technological take-up and
improve institutional capacity.
Enabling a sustainable technological 
transformation
Create a strategy for mGovernment. A holistic mGovern-
ment strategy or strategic framework can help governments
identify gaps in technology and human capacity, in financial
sustainability, and in the applications development ecosys-
tem. It can also help raise the profile of mGovernment,
potentially leading to high-level political support. And
mGovernment programs should be aligned with broader
national development programs and strategies.31 Such a
strategy could also define needed technology, service, and
data standards; identify common facilities and resources to
be developed within the government; and look for oppor-
tunities for partnering with civil society, the private sector,
and entrepreneurs. The strategy could also define ways to
make these programs financially sustainable. It will be
important, however, to avoid restricting innovation and
flexibility. Furthermore, coordination should not imply that
some types of sector- or function-specific systems should
never exist independently; some services (such as in health
or education) will have specific needs and might be justifi-
ably separate in their implementation.
Enable innovation. Much of the development in mobile
applications and services worldwide has come from inno-
vation by nongovernment agencies. Governments are
often late adopters of this technology. Hence, there is
much to gain from allowing such innovation to continue,
with governments encouraging innovation and working
with partners such as mobile networks, applications

• Incentivize testing through iterative
processes, user-centric design, and

developers, and civil society organizations to design and
pilot applications. At the least, interested agencies within
government should be encouraged to move swiftly toward
implementing “quick wins” that demonstrate the validity
of the approach and hence secure greater support among
other participants. Definition of technology standards
and opening of gov ernment facilities (such as data centers
or data sets) will help direct such innovation and avoid
undesirable fragmentation of systems. Governments
could also partner with universities and mobile networks
to develop skills among potential mobile application
developers.
Make mobile technology accessible and affordable. Govern-
ments will need to promote universal access and service for
specific user groups where mobile networks have yet to
reach, especially because these groups also tend to be the
unserved for regular government services. Efforts should
also focus on improving the affordability of devices and
services. Some countries may be able to reduce the price of
devices by cutting excessive taxes, duties, or levies. Service
prices might be reduced by consolidating demand across
government, for example, through purchases of bulk SMS or
IVR minutes. The reader is directed to chapter 7 on this
topic (see also Kelly and Rossotto 2012; Muente-Kunigami
and Navas-Sabater 2010).
Enable mobile payments. Many government transactions
involve the transfer of money to citizens or payment of fees
by citizens. Enabling mobile payments will allow citizens to
make and receive payments securely, even if they do not have
bank accounts or cannot securely carry cash, and will
encourage them to use mobile-based services. The reader is
directed to chapter 5 for further discussion.
Adopt standards for technologies and content. Govern-
ments can help to enable innovation by adopting standards
for technologies and content. For example, the Open 311
framework is a protocol developed by a combination of
government and civil society organizations and adopted by
municipalities for location-based collaborative issue track-
ing.32 Adopting Open 311 could help standardize complaint
or issue management applications across government,
making them interoperable. Such standards could also
extend to how government agencies open and share the
information and data they produce. Such information, when
digitized and openly available, could facilitate the creation of
mGovernment services (box 6.4).
Create shared facilities. Some governments, such as those in
Kerala state and Jordan, are creating shared facilities to
develop, deploy, operate, and manage mGovernment ser -
vices. For citizens, such common facilities would make
access simpler and more organized by enabling “single
windows” (Hellstrom 2008). For the government, these
resources include the hardware and software needed to run
applications as well as the communication services to
connect with users through mobile telecommunications
networks (such as text messages, voice minutes, data serv-
ices). These facilities could also include commonly used
tools to simplify development and deployment of mGovern-
ment services (such as survey tools, peer-to-peer communi-
cation tools, short codes). Such shared facilities for
mGovernment could also link with efforts to create govern-
ment cloud-computing facilities.33
Support content creation and use in local languages. As
with any technology, cultural context, user capability, and
local relevance will drive adoption and success. Ensuring
that mGovernment services remain focused on beneficiar-
ies is important, especially in the case of service delivery or
information provision. Governments will need to engage
with a wide range of stakeholders—technologists, commu-
nities, users, intermediaries, and public service providers—
to design and develop demand driven and user-centric
applications and services. Updated content will have to
be created or kept in local languages, and the content and
the application will need to fit the needs and ICT literacy
levels of users.
Mobilize and train users. Users beyond early adopters need
to understand the benefits of using mGovernment services.
Community-level intermediaries can play a vital role in
educating users and driving adoption of applications.
 Critically, however, evidence of government responsiveness
and improved service delivery and governance will be the
most effective means to attract citizens to this platform.
Encourage public-private partnerships to support
mGovernment. Both private and public sector efforts will
96
Information and Communications for Development 2012

complement and strengthen each other. Initially, the private
sector will focus on commercially viable applications
including media and infotainment, mCommerce, and
advertising- or subscription-based information services.
With the right incentives and given the opportunity,
private entities can supplement state technological capacity
and create and deploy applications that serve public needs
or support program management. The examples of Kerala
(see box 6.2), where the IT Mission has contracted with a
private company, and of SeeClickFix, a private group work-
ing with municipalities, suggest such new possibilities.
Such partnerships could also help close technological or
human capacity gaps, with private firms taking on the
responsibility of managing the technology and sharing
some of the financial or political risks.
Strengthening the institutional capacity to respond
Enable shared responsibility in service delivery. A key
consideration is how the nature of service delivery will
change as technology and its use evolves. It is difficult to
predict the extent of transformation in services. However,
governments can begin to prepare by looking for ways to
share responsibility, which can also create the possibility of
increasing capacity. Three options exist: governments could
transfer responsibility for service delivery to the private
sector or civil society, share responsibility for serving citizen
Making Government Mobile
97
Governments are beginning to open public data sets and make them accessible to the public
and civil society. With mobile telephones being more widespread than PCs, it is not surpris-
ing to see more open data being made available on mobile platforms with interesting conse-
quences.
In July 2011 Kenya became one of the first African countries to launch an open data
initiative, making some 160 government datasets open to the public, with more on the
way (www.opendata.go.ke). The aim was to lead to a more responsive and citizen
focused-government. Among the initial data sets that were uploaded are poverty surveys
by district, budget by government department, and plans for future changes in electoral
districts and health facilities. A beta site was launched in June 2009 and the public site a
year later. 
But in Kenya, as in many other developing nations, mobile ownership far exceeds PC owner-
ship, so to increase transparency and widen access, facilitating mobile access to the data is an
important goal. Kenya’s experience with Ushahidi (see box 6.1) created a local precedent for this.
To support the development of mobile applications that would open up the government data, the
Kenya ICT Board launched the Tandaa Digital Content Grant, offering up to 30 awards totaling
$1.5 million. An early success came
when exam results were made avail-
able on mobile phones.
Providing data to citizens, civil
society, and entrepreneurs will
support their ability to engage with
the government and help develop
new ideas and services. As such,
open data is part of making the
government a platform on which
stakeholders and constituents can
engage, interact, and create.

demands with other actors, or continue to supply improved
or enhanced services but with the help of private and civil
society actors. These models can exist side by side. For
example, many countries have transferred responsibility for
infrastructure construction and operation (roads, power,
telecommunications) to the private sector while retaining
or sharing responsibility in others areas such as education
or health services. In any case, governments will need to
consider how the re-engineering of processes could open
new models for service delivery and remove any unneeded
legal or regulatory impediments to transferring or sharing
responsibility where such models are valuable.
Promote efficiencies in processes and in resource alloca-
tion and management. Governments can encourage the
use of mGovernment tools by creating opportunities for
greater efficiencies within existing workflows and
processes. In an analogous example, the government of
Bhutan encouraged civil servants to use electronic commu-
nications technology while cutting office stationery budg-
ets.34 As was the case in Bhutan, adequate training and
capacity building will be needed to support the transition
to the use of mobile tools.
Build trust. One of the most critical, yet often ignored,
aspects in mGovernment is to balance the increased interac-
tion between governments and citizens with the need to
ensure privacy and security. There are three aspects to this—
the security of private information, avoiding the perception
of surveillance, and managing anonymity—which are
discussed in box 6.5. Legal and ethical views on privacy vary
from government to government and also depend on social
context. Yet, in every case, governments must maintain the
expected level of trust through a combination of legal and
technical actions. Infringements must be dealt with quickly.
A related area for consideration is the development of elec-
tronic or mobile identification services to protect citizens’
identities in their interactions with governments and to
prevent data leakage and fraud. The government of Moldova
is now developing a system to create a unified way to solve,
for any electronic or mobile application, security-related
tasks such as identity management, authentication, and
transaction authorization.35
Train government officials on strategic uses of mGovern-
ment. Governments will need to undertake some capacity-
building programs to develop skills of government officials
to understand and use mGovernment tools. In Afghanistan,
the Ministry of Communications and IT coordinates
government training of chief information officers (CIOs)
with targeted mGovernment-related training. It is also creat-
ing a team of mGovernment advisors—international
experts who could advise on strategic interventions—to
support the cadre of CIOs and officials keen to deploy
mGovernment tools.
Incentivize testing, user-centric design, and innovation.
Governments could consider promoting innovative
approaches to applications development and operation
through innovation challenges or competitions;36 set up
incubators that provide entrepreneurs within and outside
government a physical, social, and intellectual space to
develop innovative services; or support national innovation
policy programs. A forthcoming Innovation Support
Program in Afghanistan explicitly targets the development
of products for improved public service delivery and adop-
tion. Governments should also borrow from techniques
employed in the private sector for the development and
adoption of new technology platforms and services, such as
iterative, pilot-based service rollout, and user-centric design
to ensure relevance and usability. 
Conclusions
The ubiquity of the mobile telephone has created an oppor-
tunity for governments around the world to improve serv-
ice delivery and enhance governance. Mobile tools also
create the opportunity for citizens to participate directly
and engage with governments like never before. Already,
examples from a wide range of countries, provinces, and
cities are showing that mGovernment is taking hold and
helping supplement, expand, and innovate services and
governance. 
Mobile government is relatively nascent and the potential
of mobile devices continues to evolve, so new ideas are
certain to emerge to help make governments mobile. Based
on experience thus far, however, governments seeking to go
mobile will need to create an enabling environment for tech-
nology transformation as well as the institutional capacity to
respond to citizen requests for service. 
In closing, any government seeking to adopt mobile
tools should keep in mind that this process will successfully
98
Information and Communications for Development 2012

transform the government-citizen relationship only when
governments enable the transformation of both elements—
“mobile” and “government.”

Making Government Mobile
99
As governments find more ways to deliver services using mobile and geo-location technolo-
gies, concerns over security and privacy are mounting. If used properly, mGovernment can
promote transparency and accountability of service delivery. However, citizens often express
concern about the security of their private and confidential information, possible surveillance,
and anonymity, among other issues.
It is vital that governments create a legal and technical framework to protect data from
corruption or leakage. Without strong protection or the quick resolution of any breach, citizens
will be wary of sharing their information with the government, and efforts to connect and inter-
act would quickly be undermined. Internet users already face security problems—for example,
so-called “Trojans” or “malware” can compromise personal computers and gather private
data from users illegally.
While location- and context-based services offer powerful opportunities, illegal or unwar-
ranted surveillance must also be avoided. Again, citizens need to be assured that installing
applications or using services will not compromise their privacy. Governments will need to
exercise care in securing their systems and software to avoid any perception of surveillance.
For example, the Data Protection Working Party, an independent European Union advisory
body on data protection and privacy, has suggested that users of smartphones and other
mobile devices give clear and explicit consent and have a clear understanding of how the data
will be used, before location data is collected.
Finally, citizens might seek anonymity (or pseudonymity) as they become more vocal to
avoid the risk of reprisals due to their views. Governments may need to consider which ser -
vices require identification and which services (anticorruption hotlines, for example) might be
more popular if citizens can remain anonymous when they make a report.
Balancing privacy concerns against the government’s need to ensure that it is dealing with
legitimate users of the service should not be a barrier to exploring mGovernment. Rather, it
should be the catalyst for ongoing conversations regarding the strength of privacy laws and
proper auditing alongside the ability to share information.

his final chapter looks to the future and provides
policy recommendations for expanding the range
and uptake of mobile applications for develop-
ment. In practical terms, that means looking at the shift
toward mobile broadband networks. Broadband has a posi-
tive impact on growth and development (Qiang and Xu
forthcoming). Mobile broadband, in particular, is expected to
show an even higher positive effect on economic growth,
especially in developing countries. Thus, mobile broadband
development and diffusion across the economy is a subject of
policy action. Unlike other information and communication
technology (ICT) services, such as fixed-line voice telephony,
broadband (including mobile broadband) behaves as an
ecosystem where the supply and demand sides interact and
mutually reinforce each other. Hence, both aspects of the
ecosystem—supply and demand—need to be addressed by
policy initiatives (Kelly and Rossotto 2011). Supply-side poli-
cies aim at promoting and enabling the expansion of mobile
broadband networks; demand-side policies seek to increase
adoption of mobile broadband services. Policy recommenda-
tions for both supply and demand are addressed below.
The mobile broadband opportunity
and developing countries
As discussed in chapter 1, broadband has an important effect
on economic growth and development. Numerous studies
have found a positive relationship between broadband pene-
tration and economic growth, particularly in developing
countries (Qiang and Rossotto 2009, 45; Friedrich et al. 2009,
4; Katz et al. 2010, 2; Digits 2011). One of the transmission
channels of this growth is linked to the transformational
effect of broadband throughout the sectors of the economy,
raising productivity and efficiency (Kelly and Rossotto 2011).
Mobile broadband has been found to have a higher impact
on GDP growth than fixed broadband, through the reduc-
tion of inefficiencies (Thomson et al. 2011). 
Mobile telephony has already demonstrated that
networks that use spectrum, such as mobile networks, are
often the most efficient infrastructure for expanding ICT
services worldwide, especially in developing countries,
which generally suffer from a shortage of fixed infrastruc-
ture (see Statistical Appendix). Such is the case for broad-
band, which is now growing faster in developing
countries than in developed ones, with a compound aver-
age growth rate of over 200 percent since 2009. In some
countries, such as Colombia, Kenya, South Africa, and
Vietnam, mobile broadband is already the main platform
for broadband access, having surpassed fixed broadband
by over 10 times in the two African countries and almost
3 times in Vietnam (figure 7.1).
Even so, the broadband gap between developing and
developed countries is increasing.1 Whereas around half
of mobile connections provide broadband access in

developed countries, in developing countries this
percentage is below 10 percent. The different pace of
mobile broadband adoption has many causes, one of
which has been more aggressive policies in developed
countries to enable and foster the implementation of
mobile broadband technologies. As shown by examples in
Chile, Germany, Sweden, and the United States, to name
but a few, policies that foster mobile broadband allow for
its faster and wider diffusion. 
Policy recommendations 
for facilitating mobile 
broadband diffusion 
To understand how policy-making can promote and enable
broadband, it is useful to understand the various elements
that influence broadband diffusion. By contrast with other
ICT services, such as voice, broadband works as an ecosystem,
where the supply and demand sides interact and reinforce
each other (Kelly and Rossotto 2011, 25). Thus, broadband
diffusion not only requires the supply of access through
network coverage expansion, but also the development and
availability of demand-side enablers, such as affordable smart
devices and content and applications that respond to user
needs (figure 7.2). 
With this framework in mind, policies to support and
enable broadband diffusion through mobile networks
can be categorized as either supply-side or demand-side
policies.
Supply-side policies
Supply-side policies aim to expand mobile broadband
networks by addressing the bottlenecks and market failures
that constrain network expansion and by providing incen-
tives for wider mobile broadband coverage. Bottlenecks and
market failures differ among countries, and policy-makers
and regulators should assess their specific market condi-
tions, prioritizing those policies that are relevant to their
domestic bottlenecks and market failures. However, two
main bottlenecks are relatively common worldwide: insuffi-
cient availability of spectrum, and inadequate backbone
networks. 
The following policy recommendations focus on these
common bottlenecks, as well as on incentives for expanding
the coverage of mobile broadband networks.
Ensure sufficient availability of quality spectrum to deploy
cost-effective mobile broadband networks. Availability of
spectrum may become a bottleneck to the development of
mobile broadband networks for various reasons. First, to facil-
itate rapid deployment of these networks, operators need
spectrum that is technically adapted to the most cost-efficient
mobile broadband technologies. Technologies are designed to

be more efficient in specific spectrum bands. International
harmonization provides the benefits of economies of scale
for network equipment. As a result some bands are much
more commercially attractive than others. If spectrum is not
offered for the bands where the most cost-efficient technolo-
gies work, operators have to opt for other less efficient
options, which can result in more limited investments or no
investments at all. 
Second, operators need spectrum in the bands that are
most effective for deploying mobile broadband technolo-
gies. For instance, a fourth-generation broadband mobile
technology such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) can operate
in multiple frequency bands, but the lower bands (such as
700 and 800 megahertz, or MHz) can be more cost-effective,
allowing for both wider coverage from fewer radio base
stations (an important consideration for rural area deploy-
ments) and higher powers to support building penetration
(an important consideration in urban areas). Using optimal
frequency bands can also assist with the high availability of
network equipment and lower prices resulting from global
economies of scale. Continuing with the previous example,
deployments of LTE networks driven by U.S. and European
operators have generally been more successful in the 700 and
800 MHz bands. That has resulted in more affordable
network equipment in these two bands. 
Third, blocks of spectrum must be sufficiently large to
allow cost-efficient provision of mobile broadband, with
multiple operators. LTE, for example, allows operations with
different-sized blocks of spectrum (from 1.4 to 20 MHz); the
size of the spectrum blocks and the pairing of frequencies
determines the maximum broadband speed and the cost of
deploying mobile broadband networks based on this tech-
nology. Because data traffic and bandwidth are growing
rapidly, operators may need larger blocks of spectrum to
cope with demand and avoid congestion, particularly in
urban areas. Use of Wi-Fi networks to offload mobile broad-
band traffic from cellular networks can also help to offset
congestion pressures over these networks. However, these
complementary networks will not be able to solve the grow-
ing congestion problem by themselves. Although forecast to
almost double, Wi-Fi offload traffic is expected to handle
only around 20 percent of total mobile broadband data by
2016 (CISCO 2012). 
To minimize bottlenecks in the availability of spectrum,
policy-makers and regulators should assess spectrum needs
and available cost-efficient technologies and release to the
market spectrum of suitable and sufficient quality for these
technologies. In some case, policy-makers and regulators
may need to refarm spectrum (the practice of making spec-
trum available by moving existing users or organizing band
use more efficiently) and reassign legacy users with less
valuable uses or less efficient technologies to other bands.
Permitting spectrum trading among operators also allows
for spectrum refarming for more efficient uses through
private sector–led transactions. The digital switchover (the
process whereby analog television has been superseded by
digital television) has allowed spectrum managers world-
wide to liberate spectrum for other uses, particularly
mobile broadband. That in turn has allowed policy-makers
worldwide to institute spectrum refarming. In the United
States, the 700 MHz band, where LTE networks are
currently being deployed, was released as a result of the
digital switchover. Similarly, in Europe, countries such as
Sweden and Germany have taken advantage of the digital
switchover to release spectrum in the 800 MHz band for
their LTE networks. 
Eliminate technological or service restrictions on spectrum.
The availability of spectrum is not the only issue. Technical
or technological restrictions or mandated uses that require
the spectrum to be used for other services could still act as a
bar to mobile broadband technologies. Eliminating such
restrictions, and making spectrum technologically neutral,
allows operators to choose the most efficient technology to
deploy on broadband services. Market mechanisms for spec-
trum allocation, such as auctions or secondary trading,
should help to ensure that available spectrum is used effi-
ciently. This is valid not only for current mobile broadband
technologies, such as WiMAX, HSPA, or LTE, but also for
other technologies that may be developed in the future.
Applying the principle of technological neutrality is as rele-
vant for new spectrum being released as for spectrum that
has already been allocated, particularly second- and third-
generation (2G, 3G) band spectrum. Operators can thus
leverage existing network deployments in the 2G- and 
3G-bands, such as GSM (Global System for Mobile commu-
nications), and Wideband CDMA (Code Division Multiple
Access), by turning over part or all of the spectrum they
already use for these services to advanced mobile broadband
technologies (in-band migration). 
This practice has been successfully applied for 3G tech-
nologies within the 2G bands in many countries, particularly
Policies for Mobile Broadband
105

in Latin America where operators could launch 3G services
before 3G licenses where awarded or in bands initially
awarded for 2G services. In Mexico operators launched 3G
services in 2007 and 2008 using both CDMA and Universal
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) technologies,
well before 3G spectrum licenses were awarded in 2009. In
Brazil operators started launching CDMA-3G services in
2004, before 3G licenses were awarded. In addition, the regu-
lator allowed the use of 2G-awarded spectrum for 3G ser -
vices as 3G spectrum licenses were awarded in 2007.2
Allowing the use of existing spectrum for any technology-
neutral use (given that these technologies do not result in
harmful interferences) also enables operators to follow a
phased and scalable approach to transition from 2G/3G
technologies to 4G technologies (such as LTE).
Focus on expansion of network coverage rather than on
spectrum proceeds. High up-front spectrum costs may limit
the capital available for operators to invest in coverage
beyond the most affluent areas (EC 2002; Delian 2001; Bauer
2002). There are several methods for awarding spectrum
rights, the most common ones being auctions, beauty
contests, and hybrid methods of these two. Although
auctions are generally considered more efficient than beauty
contests, auction designs aimed at increasing up-front
revenues for the government do not achieve the highest social
welfare benefits (Hazlett and Munoz 2008, 2010). Indeed,
auctions that extract high rents from operators may result in
delays of investments or in concentration of network cover-
age in urban and high-income areas, while rural and low-
income areas are not served (Patrick 2001). The results of the
3G auctions in Europe, where high proceeds were achieved,
but 3G network deployment was delayed for several years
and a number of licenses were returned, showed that high
up-front costs may result in low or delayed investment
(Gruber 2006). To encourage coverage in underserved
areas, some governments, such as Chile (box 7.1), Germany
(Brugger and Oliver 2010; Wireless Intelligence 2011), and
Sweden,3 have introduced hybrid methods adding specific
coverage obligations to mobile broadband spectrum
licenses to cover underserved areas, or “white spots.” 
Require transparency in traffic management and safe-
guard competition. Demand for mobile broadband is
growing exponentially. Mobile data traffic, spurred by
mobile broadband growth, is expected to grow more than
26 times in five years (figure 7.3; CISCO 2012). The expan-
sion of data-hungry devices, such as smartphones and
tablets, are already resulting in exponential increases of
traffic in some countries (see figure 1.5).
Unlike fixed broadband technologies that can make use
of the almost unlimited capacity of fiber optics to cope with
growing data traffic, mobile broadband networks must
work with finite allocations of spectrum. Mobile operators
rely on optimization of networks and traffic management
to increase efficiency, at least in the short term.4 However,
operators may also use optimization and traffic manage-
ment techniques to hinder competition through data caps
and by blocking or “throttling” access to applications. For
instance, mobile network operators may limit the band-
width available to those applications that threaten to
deprive them of revenue, such as Skype used as a substitute
for voice calls. To avoid such practices, regulators have been
imposing limits on traffic prioritization while permitting
optimization of mobile broadband networks, within the
network neutrality concept.
Network neutrality generally refers to the notion that an
Internet Service Provider (ISP) should treat all traffic
equally, including any content, application, or service
(Atkinson and Weiser 2006). Based on this principle of
nondiscrimination, a growing number of jurisdictions have
adopted regulations that range from barring ISPs from
managing internet traffic in a way that discriminates among
content providers to permitting “best efforts” to deliver
content on equal terms. These regulations have generally not
been applied to mobile networks, however. In some cases,
the justification for the exemption has been to allow mobile
broadband networks to develop. Some governments are now
beginning to regulate certain practices, for example by
requiring full access to certain applications (such as Voice
over IP services, like Skype).5 It is also useful to promote
transparency on the part of operators to explain how they
are applying traffic management.
Limit spectrum hoarding that could distort competitive
conditions in the market. Making spectrum available to the
market is critical for developing mobile broadband, but this
spectrum also must be used efficiently. Operators should use
their spectrum allocations to provide services and not to
distort the market or impede other providers from entering
the market. To avoid these pernicious effects, governments
have introduced limitations in awarding spectrum, such as
106
Information and Communications for Development 2012

spectrum caps in specific bands (see above) or sunset clauses
in case the spectrum is not brought into timely use by a
certain date. However, governments should be wary of
imposing spectrum caps that are too stringent and might
impede operators’ ability to react to market demand. Broad-
band data traffic demand is expected to require increasing
amounts of spectrum, especially in urban areas (Rysavy
Research 2010). For this reason, it is advisable for govern-
ments to be flexible in using spectrum caps and monitor the
market needs and competitive conditions as they evolve. If
competition conditions are not in danger, regulators and
policy-makers would be better off monitoring market
conditions rather than establishing spectrum caps. Mobile
broadband demand can grow very quickly as more and more
applications are developed and handsets prices are reduced
(see below). In this scenario, caps that are too stringent may
result in underdevelopment of mobile broadband services,
lower speeds, or limited quality of service.
Policies for Mobile Broadband
107
In Chile, the government provided spectrum in multiple bands for mobile broadband in
underserved rural areas. Chile offered subsidies through a reverse auction (resulting in a
government subsidy of more than $100 million) to develop mobile broadband in around
1,500 municipalities in rural areas, where no broadband service was available. Extending
coverage to these areas could mean that 90 percent of Chile’s population would have broad-
band coverage. Minimum service conditions for broadband access (such as a 1 Mbit/sdown-
link) and a ceiling on prices was established. The winner of the auction, Entel Movil, started
deploying mobile broadband in these areas in September 2010.a The large expansion of
mobile broadband services in the country, has permitted Entel Movil to achieve the largest
share of mobile broadband connections in the country, surpassing its other two main
competitors (figure 7.1.1).

Foster the development of national broadband backbone
networks. In contrast to voice mobile networks, mobile
broadband networks require high bandwidth backbones to
support the delivery of broadband to end users. To support
rising volumes of mobile broadband traffic, the backbone
networks of the mobile platform must be upgraded to fiber.
Governments can support the development of backbone
networks by enacting infrastructure sharing policies, allow-
ing mobile operators to make rational build or lease deci-
sions, streamlining procedures to obtain rights of ways (by
issuing national rights of way, for example), and adopting
other specific policies. In addition, governments can foster
the development of backbone networks by coordinating
with the private sector, providing seed capital for the devel-
opment of backbone networks, and enabling public-private
partnership (PPP) schemes. However, governments must be
careful to avoid market distortions when intervening in the
infrastructure market.
In addition, governments can also encourage the open-
ing to broadband operators of fiber infrastructure
deployed by other utilities, such as electricity, roads, or
water. Many utilities have already deployed fiber networks
for internal operational purposes, and their surplus
capacity can be utilized for broadband development.
Indeed, this surplus fiber capacity can serve to build or
complement mobile broadband backbone networks
(Arthur D. Little 2010). 
Foster infrastructure and spectrum sharing. Policies that
encourage infrastructure sharing allow operators to develop
common networks, share costs, and hence lower investment
requirements, all of which can result in lower prices for
users.6 In Kenya, instead of auctioning LTE-band spectrum
to separate operators, the government is planning to imple-
ment a PPP model with a sole network with LTE-band spec-
trum available on an open-access basis. The possible risk is
that by creating an effective monopoly, deployment may be
slow and inefficient. On the other hand, by requiring
companies to share a common infrastructure, the aim is to
reduce duplicate investment and minimize competition
distortion (Msimang 2011). 
Demand-side policies
Demand-side policies aim at expanding adoption of broad-
band services by addressing the barriers to adoption and
fostering the development of broadband-based services and
applications and thereby promoting user demand. As with
supply, local market conditions affect the effectiveness of
demand-side policies, and policy-makers and regulators
should take good note of those conditions. Two main
barriers to entry are relatively common among developing
countries, namely, the availability and affordability of
broadband-enabled devices and service. In addition, the
development of services and applications that address local
market needs has proven to be a critical driver of demand
for broadband services, because such services can improve
their value proposition for businesses and consumers. 
Ensure the availability and affordability of broadband-
enabled devices. As mobile broadband has expanded glob-
ally, the reach of broadband-enabled devices, such as
handsets and tablets, has increased, and their price has fallen.
As penetration continues in developing countries, manufac-
turers are targeting these markets by providing low- and
ultra-low-cost devices and designs tailored to these markets’
needs. The global market for handsets has seen a continual
reduction in prices even as performance increases. Mobile
broadband handsets, or smartphones, have fallen in price
from more than $300 in 2005 to less than $100 in 2011 for
low-end models (IBM 2011; Kalavakunta 2007). Devices
costing under $16 are forecast by 2015 (Scottsdale 2011). 
However, barriers such as taxes, import restrictions, and
duties may prevent consumers from benefiting from best
global market prices (Katz et al. 2011). Direct sales taxes

affect all legitimate handsets on sale within a country, and
their level should be assessed carefully by policy-makers to
avoid limiting broader access or spurring a profusion of
“gray market” devices. Import restrictions and duties apply
only to imported devices, but given that equipment manu-
facturing has become a global industry, virtually all devices
are imported to some extent. The combination of sales taxes
and import duties may increase prices to unaffordable levels
for most of the population. For instance, in Bangladesh
handsets are subject to a 12 percent import duty and an
additional sales tax of 15 percent (Boakye et al 2010).
Subsidization of handsets by the mobile voice industry
has made them affordable but has kept service prices high.
As a result, a few countries, such as Finland, have made the
practice illegal.7 In the case of mobile broadband, though,
high-end devices that make use of more efficient networks
(such as LTE) may actually reduce unit prices for data. So,
policy-makers should be prepared to show evidence of
market distortion effects before imposing bans on subsidiz-
ing broadband-ready devices.
Finally, some countries have promoted domestic devel-
opment of cheap handsets. For instance, India has fostered
the development of cheap tablets coupled with a program of
subsidies for the education sector, making tablets for educa-
tion available for $35, less than 3 percent of that country’s
annual gross national income (GNI) per capita.8 Not all
countries have the manufacturing base, low labor costs, and
large domestic market size of India, however, so policy-
makers need to evaluate carefully the potential for success of
these kinds of policies in their local markets. Without
import protection, it is difficult to compete on cost and
quality with the global market.
Enable increasing affordability of broadband services.
Along with the cost of the handsets themselves, service costs
may deter access to broadband. Mobile operators have
generally been successful at reducing the total cost of
ownership for mobile phones, in best practice cases to
below $5 a month for a basket of services.9 Prepaid offerings
have been the most successful marketing strategy to
increase the affordability of mobile services. In fact, prepaid
service has been an important driver of mobile telephony in
developing countries; for example, more than 80 percent of
all users in Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America in the
third quarter of 2011 bought prepaid service (Wireless
Intelligence 2011).
A similar strategy is being applied to mobile broadband.
Operators provide prepaid packages and other tailored ser -
vices for mobile broadband services, such as offering a USB
(universal serial bus) “dongle”10 with a certain amount of
data that can be used on laptops or PCs over cellular
networks. For instance, in the Arab Republic of Egypt
mobile operators are offering prepaid traffic-based mobile
broadband access starting at $8, less than 4 percent of the
monthly GNI per capita.11 In Colombia operators offer
prepaid mobile broadband for different prices based on
duration and service access, ranging from $0.5 a day for chat
or email access only to $25 a month for full broadband
access, less than 6 percent of monthly GNI per capita at the
highest offering.12 Policy-makers and regulators should
enable these practices and avoid distorting the market
unnecessarily. Imposing a high level of taxes (particularly
direct taxes) on mobile broadband service may reduce their
affordability and deter adoption (Katz et al. 2011).
As the mobile voice market proved, competition among
service providers is also a critical driver of price reductions
and innovative offerings that increase affordability
(Rossotto et al. 1999). Policy-makers and regulators should
safeguard competitive conditions in the market and, when
needed, increase competition (by reducing barriers to entry
to the market, for example, or increasing the number of
licenses).
Enable the development of broadband applications and
content. Applications and content are drivers of broadband
demand. Broadband in itself does not provide much value
directly to business and consumers. It is the applications and
content that can be accessed through broadband that
consumers want. Mobile broadband has made this link even
more evident. Adoption of mobile broadband services is
closely followed by applications growth for this service
(figure 7.4). 
Mobile applications are easier to use than earlier web-
based applications and allow additional features, such as
geo-location of services, unique to mobile services. Coupled
with social networks, applications are now the main demand
drivers for mobile broadband. But most mobile broadband
applications and services are developed in and for developed
countries. For instance, the vast majority of downloads for
the Android platform have occurred in the United States,
followed by the Republic of Korea, Japan, and other devel-
oped countries (Empson 2011). 
Policies for Mobile Broadband
109

To foster local demand for mobile broadband applica-
tions and content, policy-makers actively promote local
capacity for development and customization. Policy-
makers can develop policies to provide the right enabling
environment for this industry and to actively foster its
development through the creation of a mobile broadband
innovation ecosystem. Co-creation platforms linking
educational institutions and industry as well as technol-
ogy hubs and crowdsourcing strategies are some of the
tools for creating such an ecosystem. In addition, policy-
makers can encourage government agencies to develop
mGovernment applications (see chapter 6) and content
for mobile broadband (through open data policies, for
example), as well as acting as a consumer for sectoral
applications (in education or health, for instance), in
order to create a critical mass for the development of local
applications and content.
Conclusions
Fostering mobile broadband diffusion in developing coun-
tries requires appropriate policy actions to enable and
encourage both components of the mobile broadband
ecosystem—supply and demand. Policy-makers should eval-
uate local conditions before applying specific policies, screen-
ing for bottlenecks or market failures on each of side of the
ecosystem. The most common bottlenecks and market fail-
ures on the supply side are spectrum and backbone networks.
On the demand side, limited availability of affordable
broadband-enabled devices and services, as well as the lack of
local applications and content, are the main bottlenecks and
market failures. The policy recommendations described in
this chapter provide guidance on how to address these
common barriers. 
This report has shown the potential of mobile applica-
tions to transform different sectors of the economy while
benefiting the livelihoods and lifestyles of citizens and
communities. Mobile broadband is an important element in
that process, because it will offer the tools, from smart-
phones to services, that enable that transformation to take
place: from access to apps.

disappear once the hardware is increasingly built into the

Measuring mobile take-up
Mobile telephony has been one of the most quickly
adopted technologies of all time. While 128 years passed
before fixed telephone lines reached 1 billion users, mobile
networks achieved this milestone in just over two decades
(figure A.1). Even more astounding, mobile networks have
roughly doubled in size every two years since 2002. By the
end of 2011, there were 5.9 billion mobile cellular subscrip-
tions worldwide.
This huge growth in mobile subscriptions has led to a
significant increase in penetration. The traditional measure
of mobile telephony penetration is the number of subscrip-
tions per 100 people. By the end of 2011, more than 8 of
every 10 people around the world had a mobile subscrip-
tion, up from just over 1 in 10 in 2000, with particularly
strong gains in middle-income countries (figure A.2). Over
the span of a single decade, mobile telephones have changed
from an elitist gadget that was mainly the preserve of high-
income countries to a mass-market tool spanning the globe. 
Some 90 economies—almost half of the member coun-
tries of the World Bank—had a mobile penetration exceed-
ing 100 percent in 2011. Because there are more mobile
subscriptions than inhabitants in these countries, these
statistics do not reflect the number of people who actually
have use of a mobile phone, because the same person may
possess multiple SIM cards (for example, to avail themselves
of lower on-network calling prices or to separate business
from personal calls), and thus have multiple subscriptions.
In the United Arab Emirates in 2010, for example, 28 percent
of subscriptions were duplicates, mainly for these reasons, as
well as for roaming and gaining better coverage in different
parts of the country (UAE 2011). 
Another factor skewing the figures in some countries is the
number of mobile cellular subscriptions taken by people resid-
ing in bordering nations. Subscriptions can also be inactive,
with the length of time that must pass before the subscription
elapses varying by operator. At the same time, an increasing
number of devices are connected to mobile networks that do
not use voice services or do not interface with humans. These
include laptop computers, as well as equipment such as auto-
mated teller machines. In Spain, these types of subscriptions
accounted for 10 percent of the mobile market in 2010.
Although methods other than counting subscriptions
may be more precise for measuring access to mobile phones,
subscription data are most widely available. For example,
another useful measure could be the number of persons
with access to a mobile phone. But gathering that data
requires the use of surveys, which are conducted only infre-
quently or, in many countries, not conducted at all. 
Another measure is the number of households where at
least one household member has a mobile phone. This
metric is useful because it is precise: it cannot exceed 100.
If a mobile phone exists in a household, then all members
Key Trends in the Development of the
Mobile Sector 
Michael Minges 

could theoretically use it, thereby extending access. House-
hold availability has thus been the traditional indicator for
measuring universal service. This indicator is collected by
a growing number of countries through ongoing house-
hold surveys, as well as special health surveys. The United
Nations recommended in 2008 that the question “House-
hold having mobile cellular telephone(s)” be included in
the questionnaires used for the 2010 round of censuses.1
Based on the surveys carried out by a significant number
of countries, almost three of four households were esti-
mated to have mobile phone service in 2010. 
Another factor to consider is household size. Individual
use surveys tend to exaggerate subscription penetration
rates in developed economies, while household surveys
suggest that the level of access to mobile is higher in many
developing countries than subscription penetration
figures would suggest. Access is particularly high in coun-
tries with large households. Take Senegal, where the
subscription penetration was 57 per 100 people in 2009,
but household penetration was estimated to be 30 points
higher at 87 (figure A.3a). This larger household size can
dramatically extend access to mobile phones, considering
that on average nine persons are in each Senegalese house-
hold. Several low-income nations have higher mobile
phone home penetration than some developed economies.
For example, Senegal, along with some other low- and
middle-income economies, has a higher proportion of
homes with mobile phones than either Canada or the
United States (figure A.3b).

Reaching the base of the pyramid 
At the turn of the new millennium, most analysts would
have considered a world with 6 billion cellular phones
impossible. At the time, there were some 700 million mobile
subscriptions, 70 percent of which were located in high-
income economies. This link between mobile penetration
and national income gave rise to a belief that there was a
price below which mobile service would be unprofitable,
thereby making it commercially unviable and unaffordable
for many in lower-income countries. After all, fixed tele-
phones had been in existence for more than a century, yet
penetration rates were still less than 1 in 100 in many devel-
oping nations. 
The mobile industry has defied that theory. Every year, it
expands its user base, reaching more and more low-income
users. This has been made possible by cheaper equipment,
falling handset prices, prepaid subscriptions, flexible
regulation, competition for marginal users as markets
become saturated at the top, and rising incomes.2 A recent
study carried out in three provinces in China found 
that 95 percent of rural households had a mobile tele-
phone (box A.1). Nonetheless, a significant proportion of
the world’s population has no mobile connection. Of the
some 5.9 billion mobile subscriptions in the world, 
3.4 billion were in low- and middle-income economies
(figure A.4). Given some 4.8 billion residing in those
countries, that leaves a gap of 1.4 billion without a
mobile subscription. The number of people living on less
than $1.25 a day (purchasing power parity) in low- and
middle-income economies, estimated to be 1.1 billion,
might be considered outside the target market.3 That
leaves an addressable unserved population of just 300
million people worldwide at the start of 2012.
Mobile equipment manufacturer Nokia has calculated a
total cost of ownership (TCO) measure that factors in the
cost of the handset, service charges, and taxes (Nokia 2009).
The TCO needs to be adjusted by income, given that levels of
income vary between countries. Even if users can afford
service, they still need signal coverage. Figure A.5 illustrates
affordability and coverage for selected developing countries.
The relationship lends itself to four scenarios bounded by
affordability of 10 percent (that is, where mobile services are
either less or more than 10 percent of income) and coverage
(where mobile covers either less or more than 9 percent of
the population). These scenarios are reflected in the four
quadrants in figure A.5: 
1. high affordability and high coverage (upper left quad-
rant)
2. high affordability and low coverage (lower left quad-
rant) 
3. low affordability but high coverage (upper right quad-
rant) 
4. low affordability and low coverage (lower right quadrant) 
Countries where mobile services cost less than 10 percent

tend to have high levels of access (measured by the availabil-
ity of mobile phones in households). 
Service charges alone do not explain the problem.
Consider Angola, which has relatively low tariffs but also
low coverage. Mainly because of lack of competition,
Angola has not been successful in expanding mobile
coverage compared with peer countries. While two
 operators have worked in the country for more than a
decade, they used different technologies, which drove up
equipment costs and made it difficult for subscribers to
switch from one operator to the other. A mobile technol-
ogy (GSM) common to both operators has been available
only since November 2010. Further, the market remains a
duopoly.

Information and Communications for Development 2012
An ongoing World Bank project has been investigating attitudes, use, and impact of informa-
tion and communication technologies in rural China. Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, one of the activities was a survey in rural areas of three provinces (Jilin, Guizhou,
and Shandong). Some 58 percent of the population in these provinces is rural; the combined
rural population is 88 million, which would make the three provinces the 13th largest country
in the world (about the size of Vietnam). The survey, carried out in October 2011, found very
high use of mobiles, with 95 percent of rural households reporting having one. Individual
ownership was lower at 85 percent, but over half of individuals without their own mobile
reported they did not have one because they could use someone else’s or they had no need.
Around half of mobile phone owners reported sending text messages, and some 13 percent
use the internet from their cell phone. One interesting finding was the relatively large amount
spent on mobile services. Average monthly mobile phone service expenditure was 13 percent
of income, with users willing to devote up to 18 percent of their income to mobile services.

At the same time, other countries have relatively high
coverage along with relatively high prices. Consider Malawi,
where mobile networks are estimated to cover more than
90 percent of the population but where the Nokia annual
TCO amounts to more than half of per capita income.
Densely populated and relatively small, Malawi has been rela-
tively easy to cover. Attempts to introduce additional compe-
tition have not been completely successful, however, and the
market remains dominated by two operators. The least desir-
able position is to have high tariffs and low coverage. In
Madagascar, the Nokia TCO amounts to over one-third of
income, and only around three-fifths of the population is
covered. Although there are three operators, competition has
been affected by high interconnection charges. 
In contrast, some countries have a high degree of afford-
ability and coverage but relatively low take-up. The Arab
Republic of Egypt has a high penetration of fixed telephone
lines that provide an alternative to mobile. In Bangladesh
mobile calls cost about one U.S. cent a minute, and, accord-
ing to Nokia, its mobile tariffs are among the lowest in the
world.4 Coverage is high at 99 percent of the population.
Despite these extremely low prices and very high coverage,
household penetration stood at around 64 percent in 2010.
According to mobile operator Grameenphone, its attempts
to expand access are difficult because of the high SIM tax,
which has remained “the biggest barrier to the growth of
mobile telephone industry in Bangladesh” (Grameenphone
2011). The tax of Tk 800 ($11.60) on new SIM cards has a
huge negative impact on low-end subscribers. If the SIM tax
were eliminated, an estimated 90 percent of Bangladeshi
households could afford mobile service. The GSM Associa-
tion has called on the Bangladesh government to end the
SIM tax, citing it as the “single largest obstacle to the acqui-
sition of new subscribers.” (GSMA 2009)
Operators are looking at innovative ways to widen access,
including lowering recharge values, conducting more
consumer research among bottom-of-the-pyramid popula-
tions, and developing low or alternative energy base stations.
Another possibility is through virtual telephony using
emerging cloud networks. Users would not need to buy a
handset and would instead be allocated a number that they
can use on a borrowed phone. Their contacts and voice mail
would be stored on the cloud, where there would also be a
gateway to mobile money services. Virtual telephony also
lowers the cost of acquiring new users; for example, a trial
network in Madagascar claims it costs operators just $0.20 to
establish cloud-based virtual telephony services, compared
with $14–$21 to deliver a SIM card.5
The barriers to increasing access to mobile communica-
tions for every household in the world are more of a regulatory
and policy nature rather than technical. Introducing and

reflecting the average costs, by country, of handset purchase, service

TCO to GNI per capita is therefore an approximate measure of affordability
per capita. 

strengthening competition and eliminating special “mobile”
taxes could significantly narrow the range of those not served
by mobile communications. The remaining few households
without access could then be captured through universal access
programs. It is also important to ensure that those at the
bottom of the pyramid also enjoy access to value-added serv-
ices, which requires capacity building to understand how these
services can benefit their lives and how to use them.
Mobile broadband 
Using the ITU/OECD definition of broadband—networks
with a minimum download speed of 256 kilobits per second
(kbit/s)—the first mobile broadband networks were launched
in late 2000 in Japan (W-CDMA) and in 2001 in the Repub-
lic of Korea (EV-DO). According to industry sources, there
were 939 million mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide
in June 2011 (figure A.6a). This number implies that just over
15 percent of the global subscription base can theoretically
use mobile network services at high speeds. 
A number of these subscriptions are not active users of
mobile broadband (that is, they do not use the internet at
mobile broadband speeds, even though they are equipped to
do so). Users could have a theoretical ability to use mobile
broadband by having coverage and a mobile-broadband-
enabled device, but they may not necessarily be using high-
speed services, perhaps because of high prices. They could
also be subscribing to mobile broadband and using a high-
speed mobile service (such as video telephony), but not
necessarily accessing the internet. Alternatively, they could
be using mobile broadband to access the internet over hand-
sets, as well as through laptops or tablets. 
This definitional challenge presents analytical difficulties
with interpreting mobile broadband statistics. The issue is
whether to count and include theoretical access, active access
to any high-speed service, active access using internet
browsers, or active access via data cards (figure A.6b). Inter-
governmental agencies have called for more clarity on mobile
broadband statistics (OECD 2010). However, most countries
report their mobile broadband statistics in insufficient detail,

world accessed the internet from their mobiles in 2010, up
from some 180 million in 2005. Developing countries in Asia
account for over half of this total, with some two out of five
mobile internet users in China alone.
In addition to the statistical challenge of measuring active
mobile broadband users, there are often significant shortfalls
between the theoretical and actual speeds of data through-
put. Manufacturers and operators cite ever-increasing band-
width, but the average speeds fall far short. According to
Akamai’s analysis of 96 mobile networks across 58 economies
carried out in the third quarter of 2011, peak speeds were
around 8.9 megabits per second (Mbit/s), but average speeds
were 1.8 Mbit/s (Akamai 2012). In contrast, Akamai reported
average download speeds of 4.7 Mbit/s for fixed broadband
networks. Further, usage over mobile broadband networks is
generally “capped”; if users exceed a preset amount of data
transfer, then they no longer have access to data services or
their speed may be reduced or they will have to pay overage
charges. Mobile data usage varies tremendously around the
world. In the third quarter of 2011 it averaged 536
megabytes (MBs) per month across networks in 58 coun-
tries with a low of 22 MB per month and a high of 4,906 MB
per month (table A.1).
While high-speed wireless holds promise for reducing the
broadband divide, countries need to allocate spectrum and
license operators to provide services. At the end of 2011, 46
World Bank members—almost all developing countries—
had not commercially deployed mobile broadband services.
And in a number of developing countries, a high-speed
wireless service may technically exist, but it is often available
only as a fixed wireless option. 
Devices
According to Gartner, global sales of personal computers
(PCs) numbered 353 million in 2011.6 Assuming a PC is
replaced on average every five years,7 an estimated total of
1.6 billion PCs were in use around the world at the end of
2011. In comparison, some 1.8 billion mobile handsets were
sold in 2011 alone (figure A.8a).8 In other words, more
mobile phones were sold in 2011 than the entire base of
installed PCs. Sales of smartphones rose 59 percent in 2011
to more than 470 million units, about one of every four
mobile handsets. 
Another entry into the device world came in April
2010. The Apple iPad, which straddles the boundary

so data comparability remains limited. Given these defini-
tional issues, some countries have gone with the lowest
common denominator, counting only internet access
through data cards as mobile broadband (denoted by the
innermost circle in figure A.6b). 
Despite confusion over statistical definitions, mobile
broadband is already concretely impacting a number of
developing countries, allowing them to leapfrog a lack of
fixed broadband infrastructure. Based on the more certain
yardstick of data cards (arguably the most direct comparison
with wired broadband subscriptions), then mobile broad-
band far surpasses fixed broadband in nations such as the
Philippines and South Africa (figure A.7). And if the wider
definition for mobile broadband of plain internet access is
applied, then the combination of wireless networks such as
GPRS, EDGE, CDMA2000 1x, mobile broadband, and
WiMAX greatly exceeds wired connections in most develop-
ing countries. An estimated 750 million people around the

more portable and convenient device than a personal
computer, with smartphones enjoying stellar growth in
popularity (figure A.9).
Most mobile internet subscribers in developing coun-
tries are using low-end mobile handsets with minimal
features, which limits their functionality, particularly for
the development of advanced information and communi-
cation technology for development applications. For
between smartphones and laptop computers, created a
new category of “tablet” computers. Just over 14 million
iPads were sold in 2011. The launch of the iPad has helped
attract more competitors into the tablet arena, and sales
of all brands are expected to be close to 300 million by
2015. Combined global sales of smartphones and tablet
computers exceeded those of PCs in 2011 (figure A.8b).

smartphones and tablets to spread more widely and be
adopted more rapidly in developing economies, their price
needs to fall. Google is interested in developing a mass-
market smartphone for emerging nations. It has been
working with Indian handset manufacturers to develop an
Android smartphone to be sold for $150, with the price
eventually dropping to under $100. Although those prices
will widen the potential target market considerably, such
smartphones will still prove expensive for many Indians,
who “can buy less advanced phones for $40 that have
cameras and basic data services” (Sharma 2010). 
Mobile industry
Mobile economy 
The mobile industry is a significant player in many
national economies. Mobile telecommunication operators
generated an estimated $848 billion in revenue in 2011
(figure A.10).9 That is around 1.2 percent of total global
annual gross domestic product (GDP) and 56 percent of
overall telecommunication revenues. The direct economic
impact of the mobile industry varies across regions. While
revenue remains at a consistent ratio of around 1 percent
of GDP in most regions, in some developing regions, its
direct impact is far higher. For instance, in Kenya, financial
transactions via the M-PESA platform are estimated to
equate to up to 20 percent of national GDP (World Bank
2010). 
Mobile communications also has an indirect impact
beyond its direct impact on the economy. The consultancy
and accountancy firm Deloitte has developed a framework
to illustrate the wider impact of the mobile communications

This ecosystem includes equipment suppliers, support ser -
vices, resellers, and retail shops, as well as significant contri-
butions to government in the form of taxes (figure A.11).
Deloitte considers that mobile communications has three
indirect economic impacts:
1. An impact on other industries related to mobile services,
including network and handset suppliers, airtime
resellers, and the like
2. An impact on end users from improved productivity,
such as reductions in travel costs, improved job opportu-
nities, and greater market efficiency 
3. An impact on society related to such benefits as social
cohesion, the extension of communications to low-
income users, stimulation of local content, and disaster
relief assistance
In addition, there are multiplier effects throughout the
broader economy, as the initial spending related to mobile
communications ripples through other sectors of the econ-
omy. Based on various economic studies, Deloitte estimates
that this multiplier effect ranges from 1.1 to 1.7. 
The model has been used to calculate the economic
impact of mobile communications in a number of coun-
tries. One study of six countries in 2007 concluded that the
direct economic impact of mobile communications ranged
from 3.7 to 6.2 percent of national GDP (Deloitte 2008). 
The employment impact of mobile communications is
also significant. In addition to the direct employment of
mobile operators, the Deloitte model includes related indus-
tries (such as equipment suppliers and airtime resellers), as
well as spillover employment generated by government taxes
and employment created from the consumption expendi-
tures of personnel in mobile-related industries. 
Strategic investors
The mobile services industry is one of the most globalized
in the world. Practically every developing country has expe-
rienced foreign investment in its mobile cellular market, as
have many developed nations. Opening up markets to

privatization and foreign investment has been a major
factor driving the growth of the mobile industry in emerg-
ing markets. According to the World Bank’s Private Partici-
pation in Infrastructure database, between 1990 and 2010,
some 329 projects in the mobile telecommunication sector
in developing regions attracted $441 billion in private
sector investment—much of it foreign and most of it from
strategic mobile multinational groups (table A.2). No
matter the size of a country, its political system, where it is
located, or its income, private and foreign companies are
willing to invest in mobile communications. 
The relationship between foreign investors and host
countries has changed considerably in recent years.
Publicly held corporations now have to abide by a greater
range of regulations and scrutiny relating to management,
accounting, reporting, and governance than in the past.
Deviating from these rules can have severe repercussions
with investors, governments, and the public. Telenor, the
Norwegian strategic investor, was rocked by reports of
poor labor practices in firms that supply its mobile opera-
tions in Bangladesh. It immediately implemented reforms
to remedy the situation.10 At the same time, multinationals
are responding to pressing social issues such as the envi-
ronment and poverty by instituting recycling, corporate
social responsibility, and similar programs and policies.
Today, mobile communications markets in many devel-
oping countries have achieved notable scale. Indeed, some
developing country subsidiaries now enjoy larger subscriber
bases than their foreign investors’ home markets. One is
Vodafone, where the number of mobile subscriptions in its
Indian subsidiary is seven times larger than its home market
of the United Kingdom. Growth in overseas markets means
that investors are responding more to the needs of these
overseas markets than previously and leveraging lessons
learned abroad to apply throughout their group holdings. 
Many investors are developing a growing geographic
focus and specialization in certain regions. Although only a
few strategic investors are engaged around the world, most
focus on a specific region or geography. South Africa’s MTN,
for example, has investments throughout Sub-Saharan
Africa and the Middle East. It has grown from operations in
five countries in 2000 and just 2 million subscribers to oper-
ations in 21 countries and 142 million subscriptions in 2010.
Digicel, which focuses on islands in the Caribbean and
Pacific, has investments in 32 countries. Some multination-
als channel their investments through regional holdings; for
example, Vivendi works through Maroc Telecom, France
Telecom through Senegal’s Sonatel, and Vodafone through
South Africa’s Vodacom. This trend toward regional special-
ization makes investors better informed about their markets
and enhances roaming, potential economies of scale, and
platform-sharing. 
A Mobile analytical tool
This edition of the World Bank Group’s Information and
Communications for Development report features a number
of mobile indicators in both the chapter text and the statis-
tical appendix. The wide variety of indicators used can make
it difficult to gauge and benchmark country performance.
Combining several significant indicators into a smaller
number of composite indicators and tracking changes in
them over time can provide a useful analytical tool for eval-
uating the outcomes of different investments and policy
measures. These composite indicators can also be used to
diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the mobile sector
in a particular country and thereby can serve as a useful tool
for future policy development. The publication of an analyt-
ical tool is consistent with the previous edition of the report,
which introduced a series of ICT performance measures,

based on country groupings (World Bank 2009). Although
the indicators used in this analytical tool are focused only on
the mobile sector, the full range of ICT indicators used in the
performance measures can be found in the World Bank’s
Little Data Book on ICT, the 2012 edition of which is being
published in conjunction with this report. 
There have been several methodological approaches and
compilations of composite mobile indicators. The Interna-
tional Telecommunication Union (ITU) compiled a one-
time “Mobile/Internet Index” in 2002 (ITU 2002). A
framework for a composite mobile indicator with a focus
on the internet has been proposed (Minges 2005). The ITU
Digital Opportunity Index contained several mobile vari-
ables and allowed disaggregation into a mobile-only
subcategory (ITU 2006) and was updated in 2007 (ITU and
UNCTAD 2007). A mobile broadband composite indicator
has recently been compiled for Latin American nations 
(A. T. Kearney 2012). None of these composite mobile indi-
cators is particularly appropriate for this report because
they have either been one-off, are not confined to mobile,
or are limited to a particular region. Therefore a specially
constructed mobile analytical tool, based on a series of
composite indicators and building on the foundation of
this earlier work, can help to fill the void.
In the context of the development orientation of the
report, the Mobile Analytical Tool measures, on a country-
by-country basis, the affordability and coverage of mobile
networks (universality), the degree to which operators
provide voice and advanced network services (supply), and
the ownership and usage of mobile phones (demand). Each
composite indicator is constructed from two separate indica-
tors that measure these three components with equal weight
given to each (figure A.12). The three composites could also
be combined into a single measure if researchers found this
useful, but that is not the intention here. The indicators are
reproduced in the statistical appendix of this report, provid-
ing transparency and allowing users to recreate the analysis.11
The methodology is similar to that used for the United
Nations Development Programme’s Human Development
Index (HDI). Each indicator has an equal weight. Indicators
are converted to standardized values based on a logical 100
percent “goalpost.” This is a straightforward conversion except
for affordability, which is subtracted from 1 to reflect best
performance. Although the affordability value may never
reach 1 (where mobile service would be free), in 2010 there
were twenty-six economies where the price of a mobile basket
was less than 1 percent of per capita income (ITU 2011). 
Table A.3 uses the data for Morocco to provide an exam-
ple of the construction of the Mobile Analytical Tool. 
The analytical tool has been applied to a representative
range of 100 economies with data availability for the years
2005 and 2010 (table A.4 at the end of the appendix). The
results provide some interesting insights into the develop-
ment of mobile networks over that critical time period.

The mean score for all components added together
increased by 30 percent between 2005 and 2010, from
0.49 to 0.63, attesting to the rapid growth and improve-
ment in mobile networks over that period (figure A.13).
The highest increase was among low-income countries,
where significant gains in coverage were coupled with
falling prices from intensified competition. Regionally,
the highest growth was in South Asia, followed by Sub-
Saharan Africa. The highest absolute increase was in
Tajikistan, where the score rose by 0.47 points to 0.57.
Mobile competition intensified in Tajikistan between
2005 and 2010, with four GSM (Global System for Mobile
communications) and several CDMA (Code Division
Multiple Access) operators and a number of panregional
mobile groups entering the market, including TeliaSonera
and Vimpelcom. Investment soared, leading to plummet-
ing prices, an expansion of coverage, and skyrocketing
access. Several other Central Asian countries also had
among the highest growth in their scores between 2005
and 2010. 
Looking at each of the three components individually,
some 80 countries have achieved a high degree of universal-
ity (a subindex value of 0.9 or higher). Most developed and
middle-income nations had already achieved near univer-
sality by 2005, and gains since then have been marginal.
Although many developing nations had large increases in
universality between 2005 and 2010, many still remain
below the 0.9 threshold. Universal access to mobile
networks remains constrained in these countries because of
relatively high tariffs, incomplete mobile coverage, or both.
In Mali, for instance, mobile service covers less than half the
population, and the price of a monthly basket of mobile
ser vices is one-quarter of per capita income. In Rwanda,
pricing is a barrier: mobile networks cover more than 90
percent of the Rwandan population, but a monthly mobile
basket is 30 percent of per capita income. In India the
bottleneck is coverage: a mobile basket is just 3 percent of
per capita income but only three-quarters of the population
is covered.
The supply component showed the greatest increase
between 2005 and 2010, with the mean value nearly
doubling from 0.28 to 0.50. In developed countries the
increase was chiefly attributable to the deployment of
mobile broadband networks, whereas gains in developing
countries came from the provision of basic voice services.
Around half of the countries are “stuck” at a supply

component value of 0.5; there are more SIM cards than
people, but the share of mobile broadband is low.
The score achieved on the Mobile Analytical Tool is
closely related to gross national income (GNI) per capita
(figure A.14). None of the high-income economies had a
score under 0.65, and several upper-middle-income coun-
tries exceeded that value although with much lower
incomes. These include the Russian Federation and South
Africa along with Argentina, Jamaica, Jordan, Lithuania,
Macedonia, Malaysia, Mauritius, and Thailand. Japan and
the Republic of Korea stand out as outliers—their score is
significantly above where it should be considering their
income. Most countries at very low per capita income aver-
ages (less than $1,000 a year) fall below the regression line,
suggesting that a certain level of economic development is
necessary for balanced mobile growth. Regional clusters
are also noticeable: lower-middle-income economies in
Sub-Saharan Africa tend to be performing poorly whereas
the opposite is true in Central Asia. A number of Latin
American upper-middle-income economies are also not
doing as well as expected.

As might be expected, there is a close relationship
between the supply and demand categories (figure A.15a).
Outliers illustrate mismatches between supply and demand.
For example in China the demand component (0.58) is
higher than the supply component (0.35), suggesting further
room for growth (figure A.15b). Over 90 percent of Chinese
households have a mobile phone, the second-highest level
among the developing countries used in the Mobile Analyt-
ical Tool (Jordan has the highest home mobile penetration
among this group). China also has a relatively high level of
internet access through mobile phones. According to a
recent 21-country survey, some 37 percent of Chinese
mobile phone owners use their handset to access the inter-
net, a higher ratio than in France, Germany, or Spain.12 On
the supply side, China’s SIM card penetration is only 64 per
100 people, relatively low because there are few incentives for
multiple SIM card ownership thanks to inexpensive cross
network pricing. China is relatively new to mobile broad-
band with networks having launched only in 2009. Subscrip-
tions to high-speed mobile networks have grown rapidly,
and by the end of 2010 China had the third-largest number
of mobile broadband users in the world (after Japan and the
United States). Nevertheless, mobile broadband still
accounted for only 5 percent of total mobile subscriptions,
with the result that most Chinese mobile internet users were
accessing the web over narrowband mobile connections.
In contrast, Sri Lanka scores higher on the supply compo-
nent (0.45) than on the demand one (0.32). On the supply
side, there is a high degree of competition in the Sri Lankan
mobile market with SIM card penetration at 85 per 100
people. Further, Sri Lanka was the first South Asian nation to
launch mobile broadband networks. On the demand side,
however, the penetration of mobile phones in Sri Lankan
homes is only 60 percent and just 5 of every 100 people use
a mobile phone to access the internet (see figure A.15b). The
mismatch suggests that efforts here need to be devoted to
boosting demand.
Figure A.16 illustrates the relationship between the
three composite indicators and underlying indicators of
the Mobile Analytical Tool. The values for high-income
economies are contrasted with the world and low- and
middle-income averages. As noted, high degrees of univer-
sality have been achieved with high affordability and
second-generation (2G) coverage. There have also been
large gains in supply of 2G networks and household
demand between 2005 and 2010. However, levels of mobile
broadband networks and internet usage are low, and these
will be the growth areas in the future. Care is needed to
ensure that an advanced mobile digital divide does not
develop as a result of restricted mobile broadband coverage
(such as poor coverage in rural areas) and limited mobile
broadband affordability.

Key Trends in the Development of the Mobile Sector
133
The Mobile Analytical Tool provides different insights
into the availability and demand for mobile communica-
tions. It overcomes the limitations of using a single indi-
cator to gauge mobile performance. For example, the
number of mobile subscriptions is often used as a
comparator of development, but it can be misleading
because of underlying variations in multiple SIM card
ownership, which in turn reflects interoperator pricing
strategies. As the case of China and Sri Lanka illustrated,
Sri Lanka has a higher SIM card penetration but much
lower rates of actual mobile ownership and internet
browsing from cell phones. The Mobile Analytical Tool
provides a holistic and integrated perspective of country
mobile network development compared with using single
indicators to measure performance. 
Notes
1. “The importance of availability of information communica-
tion technology (ICT) devices is increasing significantly in
contemporary society. These devices provide a set of services
that are changing the structure and pattern of major social
and economic phenomena. The housing census provides an
outstanding opportunity to assess the availability of these
devices to the household” (United Nations 2008, 215). 
2. A major factor has been the development of low-cost models: “...

accompanied by the rise of homegrown mobile operators in
China, India, Africa and the Middle East that rival or exceed the
industry’s Western incumbents in size. These operators have
developed new business models and industry structures that
enable them to make a profit serving low-spending customers
that Western firms would not bother with” (Standage 2009).

The World Bank’s Mobile At-a-Glance Country Tables present
in one place the most recent country-specific mobile cellular
data from many sources. The data offer a snapshot of the
economic and social context and the structure and perform-
ance of the mobile cellular sector in some 152 economies.
Tables
Economies are presented alphabetically. Data are shown
for 152 economies with populations of more than 1 million
for which timely and reliable information exists. The
table Key Mobile Indicators for Other Economies presents
data for 64 additional economies—those with sparse data,
smaller economies with populations of between 30,000 and
1 million, and others that are not members of the World
Bank Group.
The data in the tables are categorized into three
sections:
• Economic and social context provides a snapshot of the
economy’s macroeconomic and social environment.
Several indicators have been included that relate to the
different sectors discussed in the report.
• Sector structure provides an overview of the competitive
market status in the mobile cellular sector.
• Sector performance provides statistical data on the mobile 
cellular sector with indicators for access, usage, and
affordability.
Aggregate measures for income groups 
and regions
The aggregate measures for income groups include 216
economies (those economies listed in the At-a-Glance
Country Tables plus those in the Other Economies table)
wherever data are available.
The aggregate measures for regions include only low- and
middle-income economies (note that these measures
include developing economies with populations of less than
1 million, including those listed in the Other Economies
table). The country composition of regions is based on the
World Bank’s analytical regions and may differ from
common geographic usage.
Charts
The Mobile Cellular Subscriptions chart shows the
number of mobile subscribers (per 100 people) from 2005
to 2011. Country and region information is presented
when available.
The mobile basket chart shows the mobile prepaid tariff
basket (% of GNI per capita) in the country from 2005 to
2010. Country and region information is presented when
available.
Data consistency and reliability
Considerable effort has been made to standardize the data
collected. Full comparability of data among countries
Data Notes 
Kaoru Kimura and Michael Minges

Information and Communications for Development 2012
cannot be ensured, however, and care must be taken in inter-
preting the indicators.
Many factors affect availability, comparability, and relia-
bility: statistical systems in some developing countries are
weak; statistical methods, coverage, practices, and defini-
tions differ widely among countries; and cross-country and
intertemporal comparisons involve complex technical and
conceptual problems that cannot be unequivocally resolved.
Data coverage may not be complete because of special
circumstances or because economies are experiencing prob-
lems (such as those stemming from conflicts) that affect the
collection and reporting of data. For these reasons, although
data are drawn from the sources thought to be most author-
itative, they should be construed only as indicating trends
and characterizing major differences among economies
rather than offering precise quantitative measures of those
differences.
Administrative subscription-based data generally refer to
the end of the calendar year. If end-of-year data are not
available, the most recent data for that year are used. Survey-
based data refer to the year the survey was carried out. In
some cases estimates have been made when there is suffi-
cient historical data. 
The cut-off date for data inclusion was March 31, 2012.
Data sources
Data are drawn from ictDATA.org, International Monetary
Fund (IMF), International Telecommunication Union
(ITU), United Nations; United Nations Educational, Scien-
tific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Institute for
Statistics (UIS), Wireless Intelligence, World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), and the World Bank.
Classification of economies
For operational and analytical purposes, the World Bank’s
main criterion for classifying economies is GNI (gross
national income) per capita. Every economy is classified as
low income, middle income (these are subdivided into lower
middle and upper middle), or high income. Note that classi-
fication by incomes does not necessarily reflect development
status. Because GNI per capita changes over time, the coun-
try composition of income groups may change, but one
consistent classification, based on GNI per capita in 2010, is
used throughout this publication.
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita
of $1,005 or less in 2010. Middle-income economies are
those with a GNI per capita of more than $1,005 but less
than $12,276. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-
income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of
$3,975. High-income economies are those with a GNI per
capita of $12,276 or more.
For more information on these classifications, see the
Classification of Economies by Income and Region table
below and the World Bank’s country classification website:
http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications.
Symbols
The following symbols are used throughout the At-a-Glance
tables:
— This symbol means that data are not available or that
aggregates cannot be calculated because of missing data in
the year shown.
0 or 0.0 means zero or less than half the unit shown.
$ refers to U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated.

Definitions and data sources
This section provides definitions and sources of the indicators
used in the World Bank’s Mobile At-a-Glance Country Tables. 
Economic and social context
Population (total, million) is based on the de facto defi-
nition of population, which counts all residents regardless
of legal status or citizenship—except for refugees not
permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are
generally considered part of the population of their coun-
try of origin. The values shown are mid-year estimates.
(World Bank)
GNI per capita, World Bank Atlas method (current
US$) is gross national income converted to U.S. dollars using
the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the mid-year
population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident
producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not
included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of
primary income (compensation of employees and property
income) from abroad. (World Bank) 
Rural population (% of total) refers to people living in
rural areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is
calculated as the difference between total population and
urban population. (United Nations)
Expected years of schooling (years) are the number of
years a child of school entrance age is expected to spend at
school, or university, including years spent on repetition. It
is the sum of the age-specific enrollment ratios for primary,
secondary, postsecondary nontertiary, and tertiary educa-
tion. (UNESCO Institute for Statistics)
Physicians density (per 1,000 people) refers to the
number of physicians (including generalists and specialist
medical practitioners) (WHO).
Depositors with commercial banks (per 1,000 adults)
are the reported number of deposit account holders at
commercial banks and other resident banks functioning as
commercial banks that are resident nonfinancial corpora-
tions (public and private). For many countries data cover
the total number of deposit accounts because information
on account holders is lacking. The major types of deposits
are checking accounts, savings accounts, and time
deposits. (IMF)
Sector structure
Number of mobile operators refers to licensed mobile cellular
service providers that have their own network infrastructure as
opposed to other mobile service providers who lease it (for
example, Mobile Virtual Network Operators). The data refer to
nationwide operators. (ictDATA.org)

Classification of Economies by Region and Income, FY 2012 continued
Source: World Bank.
Note: This table classifies all World Bank member economies and all other economies with populations of more than 30,000. Economies are divided among
income groups according to 2010 GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method. The groups are: low-income countries (LIC), $1,005 or less;
lower-middle-income countries (LMC), $1,006–$3,975; upper-middle-income countries (UMC), $3,976–$12,275; and high-income countries, $12,276 or more.

Data Notes
139
Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) (scale = 0–10,000)
refers to the level of market concentration. It is calculated on
the basis of the market shares of each company operating in
the industry. The market share for each company is squared;
these are then added up to get the HHI. A monopoly market
would have an HHI of 10,000; a duopoly with each operator
having half the market would have an HHI of 5,000; and a
market with four operators each having the same market
share would have an HHI of 2,500. The HHI is computed for
the mobile market based on the number of subscribers.
(ictDATA.org)
Sector performance
Access
Mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people) are
subscriptions to a public mobile telephone service using
cellular technology, which provide access to the public
switched telephone network. Postpaid and prepaid subscrip-
tions are included. Note that data is not strictly comparable
because of differences in the period in which a subscriber is
considered active and whether nonhuman subscriptions
(such as data cards for laptop access or automatic teller
machines) are included. For these reasons and others,
mobile subscriptions do not reflect actual mobile phone
ownership since there can be multiple subscriptions. (ITU,
ictDATA.org) 
Mobile cellular subscriptions (% prepaid) refer to the
total number of mobile cellular telephone subscriptions
that use prepaid refills. These are subscriptions where,
instead of paying an ongoing monthly fee, users purchase
blocks of usage time. Only active subscriptions should be
included (those used at least once in the last three months
for making or receiving a call or carrying out a nonvoice
activity such as sending or reading an SMS or accessing the
internet). The number of prepaid subscriptions is divided
by total mobile cellular telephone subscriptions. (Wireless
Intelligence)
Population covered by a mobile-cellular network (%) is
the percentage of people within range of a mobile cellular
signal regardless of whether they are subscribers. (ITU)
Mobile broadband subscriptions (per 100 people) are the
sum of the number of subscriptions using the following 
technologies: CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA,
LTE, and mobile WiMAX. (Wireless Intelligence)
Mobile broadband (% of total mobile subscriptions) is
the number of mobile broadband subscribers (defined
above) divided by the total mobile cellular subscriptions in a
country. (Wireless Intelligence)
Usage
Households with a mobile telephone (%) refers to the
percentage of households reporting ownership of a mobile
cellular telephone. (ictDATA.org)
Mobile voice usage (minutes per user per month) mea -
sures the minutes of use per mobile user per month. 
(Wireless Intelligence)
Population using mobile internet (%) refers to the share
of people using a mobile phone to access the internet
(regardless of speed or technology). The data are derived
from both mobile and internet user surveys and therefore
the figure is shown as a percentage of the total population.
In cases where survey data are not available, subscription
data (that is, mobile internet subscribers) have been used.
(ictDATA.org)
Short message service (SMS) users (% of mobile users)
refers to the percentage of mobile users who send SMS text
messages. (ictDATA.org)
Affordability
Mobile basket (US$ a month) is based on the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development’s updated
basket for low users (retrofitted also for 2005), which
includes the cost of monthly mobile use for 30 outgoing
calls a month spread over the same mobile network, other
mobile networks, and mobile-to-fixed-line calls and during
peak, off-peak, and weekend times as well as 100 text
messages a month. (ictDATA.org for 2005 data, ITU for
2010 data). For more information on the definition, see
ITU, 2011, Measuring the Information Society. Annex Table
2.1, p 144–45, http://www .itu.int/net/pressoffice/back-
grounders/general/pdf/5.pdf. 
Mobile tariff basket (% of GNI per capita) refers to the
mobile cellular prepaid monthly tariff basket divided by
GNI per capita. (ictDATA.org, ITU, and World Bank)

ith some six billion mobile subscriptions now in use worldwide, about three-quarters of 
humanity has access to a mobile phone. Mobiles are arguably the most ubiquitous modern 
technology—in some developing countries, more people have access to a mobile phone than 
to clean water, a bank account, or even electricity. And mobile communications now offer major 
opportunities to advance human development—from providing basic access to education or health 
information to making cash payments and stimulating citizen involvement in democratic processes. 
Information and Communications for Development 2012: Maximizing Mobile analyzes the growth and 
evolution of mobile telephony, including the rise of data-based services delivered to handheld 
devices through “apps” (applications) and other ways. Summarizing current thinking and seeking 
to inform the debate on the use of mobile phones to improve livelihoods, the report looks, in par-
ticular, at key ecosystem-based applications in agriculture, health, ﬁ nancial services, employment, 
and government, with chapters devoted to each, and explores the consequences of the emerging 
“app economy” for development.
The global conversation is no longer about the phone itself, but about how it is used and the 
content and applications that it opens up. These apps and “mash-ups” of services, driven by 
high-speed networks, social networking, online crowdsourcing, and innovation, are helping 
mobile phones transform lives in developed and developing countries alike. They not only ben-
eﬁ t individual users, they also boost the economy as a whole through cascade effects stimulat-
ing growth, entrepreneurship, and productivity. 
Mobile communications promise to do more than just give the developing world a voice—they 
unlock the genie in the phone, empowering people to make their own choices and decisions.

his report pulls together perspectives from many different stakeholders into a cohesive and com-
pelling document on mobile applications for development. It will indeed be a valuable contribu-
tion to practitioners, funders, and others who are trying to understand this exciting space.
