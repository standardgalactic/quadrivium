Angular 4 – What’s New? 
Angular 4 is NOT a complete re-write of Angular 2, indeed, it shouldn’t introduce any breaking 
changes. Some features will be deprecated (i.e. they still work but will get replaced with the 
next major Angular version), some new features were added. 
Why is it named Angular 4? 
It’s just Angular now – the framework should be named Angular. Have a look at the this blog 
post to learn more.
