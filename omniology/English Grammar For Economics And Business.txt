First, I must thank all the economics and business students who provided the raw material (i.e. the 
grammatical errors) and raison d’être for this guide. 
I am equally grateful to Professor Peter Nijkamp and the late Professor Piet Rietveld of the Department 
of Spatial Economics at the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration (including the Center 
for Entrepreneurship) of the VU University of Amsterdam for kindly giving their time to read the first 
draft, and suggesting a number of additional points of English grammar that often perplex writers 
of English as a foreign language. In addition, Professor Jeroen van den Bergh of the Department of 
Economics and Economic History at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain, went through the 
whole text forensically, and gave valuable feedback. And, at a later stage, Professor Peter Wakker of 
Erasmus University, Rotterdam allowed me access to his own 84-page aide-memoire on the intricacies 
of English usage, which generated some extra ideas. 
Many thanks also go to Ada Kromhout of the Writing Skills Department of the University of Amsterdam, 
who wordprocessed an earlier much shorter draft, and set an immaculate standard for the layout of 
later drafts. For a later but not final version, special thanks are due to Ellen Woudstra, Editor at the VU 
Department of Spatial Economics. And I much appreciated the friendly encouragement and practical 
assistance given by Elfie Bonke of the VU Secretariat which helped me persevere with this task. My usual 
role in the Faculty is just to correct English grammar; writing about it is quite another matter when 
there are so many ‘exceptions to the rule’ and divided opinions. Finally, I am indebted to Miriam Drori, 
editor and author, for her thorough proofreading.
I dedicate this book to my dear husband, Michael. In my attempts to create example sentences, relevant 
for the target audience, he was a patient sounding board.

Introductory Remarks and 
Reference Works Consulted
The following points of English grammar, style and presentation are those which are most relevant for 
economics and business students with fairly advanced English as a Foreign Language (EFL). This guide 
represents a distillation on a need-to-know basis of the myriad points of grammar found in standard 
textbooks. Some students with EFL have access to in-house English courses, but many do not, and those 
who do often say they are too general to be useful. 
The selected solecisms mainly concern the most common types of error that I have encountered over 
the course of 30 years, when working on around 2000 texts (articles, theses and books, both single- and 
multi-author) produced by EFL M.Phil. and Ph.D. students and academics. My client base includes 
authors from many different countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal – including the Canary 
Islands, France, the Central and Eastern European countries, Morocco, Turkey, Ethiopia, Pakistan, 
Indonesia, and China. They write on a wide range of subjects, such as taxation policy, corporate social 
responsibility, educational economics, environmental economics (including insurance and measures 
taken against flood risk; road pricing; containerization; and airport logistics), urbanization processes, 
and network theory applied to commuting.
Amongst other things, the guide tackles such constantly recurring grammatical problems as: 
• How to correctly place those slippery words: already, also, often and only in a sentence;
• When to use, or not use, the definite and indefinite articles (the, a/an);
• How to decide whether to use like or such as;
• When to use less and fewer, few and little, big, large and great; and
• How to choose between compared to and compared with.
In many cases, there is a clear right or wrong usage, but sometimes it is a case of knowing what is formal 
style, suitable for scholarly texts, and what is informal and therefore inappropriate in such texts. On a 
few occasions, it is simply a question of making a choice between two equally acceptable forms, and 
then sticking to that choice consistently.
To help with my explanations, I have consulted the following works:
Atkinson, Max, Lend me Your Ears. All you need to know about making speeches and presentations, 
Random House, UK, 2004. (An invaluable reference work for those, like Dutch Ph.D. students, who have 
to defend their thesis, often in English, in public.)

Troyka, L.Q. & D. Hesse, Simon & Schuster Handbook for Writers, Prentice Hall, Eighth Edition, 2007.
Note:	
Some of the more technical examples used to illustrate certain points of grammar and style are 
based on sentences taken from two articles published in The Journal of Industrial Economics (JIE). 
These sentences are placed between inverted commas, followed by the abbreviation (JIE). The 
reader may wonder why, out of all the economics journals in the world, I chose this particular 
one. The reason is that, when this guide was originally conceived (as a 30-page handout in 
2003), I was teaching ‘Writing Skills’ to a group of international students at the University of 
Amsterdam who were writing Masters theses in English on Industrial Economics. It seemed 
logical, therefore, to turn to a journal specializing in their subject for practical examples. The 
two articles picked at random from just one issue of JIE provided me with plenty of material 
showing both correct and incorrect usage of English. These articles were:
	
Saul Lach, ‘Do R&D Subsidies Stimulate or Displace Private R&D? Evidence from Israel’ , The 
Journal of Industrial Economics 50 (4): 369–390 (December 2002) (possibly written by an EFL 
author). 
	
Fiona M. Scott Morton & Joel M. Podolny, ‘Love or Money? The Effects of Owner Motivation in 
the Californian Wine Industry’, The Journal of Industrial Economics 50 (4): 431–436 (complimented 
in Chapter 2 of this guide Notes on Style).
Both these articles are of a high academic standard, but a close inspection reveals some grammatical 
and copy editing errors. 
In the main, however, the illustrative examples are my own, unless otherwise indicated.
Please note that, in general, the guide is in British English, which is the author’s mother tongue, and 
which is standard in the Netherlands, where the author lives and works. Attention is drawn in various 
places to American usage, where different.

Introductory Remarks and Reference Works Consulted
To facilitate reference, the selected points of grammar, etc. are explained in alphabetical order in  
Chapter 1. Immediately preceding this, on pages 14–21, a List of Frequently-found Grammatical 
and Editing Errors is provided for those readers who need rapid access to particular grammatical 
constructions. The list contains cross-references in cases where a point of grammar is mentioned in 
more than one entry. This makes it easy to find answers to both one’s own personal set of queries and 
to FAQs about grammar in general.
The item Confusion between certain words in this list is developed in more detail in Chapter 2, in order to 
highlight pairs or groups of words which look similar but which are quite different and thus cause difficulties.
To make this a more useful guide, a one-stop shop for both students and academics, Chapter 3 gives 
advice on the elusive subject of writing style, and Chapter 4 contains basic advice about the final editing 
of theses, papers, and books. 
Chapter 5 (Sections 1–5) is an in-depth study of the use of the definite and indefinite articles  
(the, a/an), especially aimed at EFL students whose mother tongue does not have any articles. They 
sometimes adopt a ‘hit and miss’ approach to the use of these articles. Sections 2 and 5 contain Diagnostic 
Tests of increasing complexity so these students can check their progress in mastering this crucial aspect 
of English grammar. 
It may be of encouragement to writers of English as a second language to know that Dr. B.C. Lamb (a 
frequent contributor to Quest, the Journal of the Queen’s English Society, and President of that Society) 
finds that his international students of Life Sciences at Imperial College (IC) London often have a better 
grasp of English and spelling than his native British students (Lamb, 1992: 5). In his survey of the 
standard of English of UK undergraduates, he also reports the surprising finding that even UK students 
reading for degrees in English ‘wrote essays full of errors in spelling and grammar’ (Lamb, 1992: 59), and 
that ‘…in several universities and industrial research groups, UK-educated staff show their writings to 
overseas-educated staff…to get the English corrected…’ (Lamb, 1992: 54). A more recent survey by Dr. 
Lamb (Quest Autumn 2007, No. 97: 22–26 and Winter 2007, No. 98: 32–37) reports a continuing dire 
situation in the UK in spite of remedial lectures. He has quantified the difference in the average number 
of English-language mistakes per student in the final-year exam paper at IC: native British 52, overseas 
students 18 (BBC Radio 4 ‘Today’ programme, 5 October 2009). I think, however, that Dr. Lamb would 
be impressed by the quality of English in the theses written by students with EFL at Dutch Universities 
before the final language check by a native speaker. 
Moreover, Bryson (2002: 30, 60) quotes errors made by a distinguished grammarian and a leading 
Professor of English. And, as will be seen in a few places in this guide, such experts may disagree amongst 
themselves, so it is not only students writing in EFL who have problems. 
In English-speaking countries there are no official bodies determining correct language use. Accordingly, 
there can be different opinions as to what constitutes correct English.

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
1	 Explanations of Common Errors 
in Alphabetical Order
A/An
Use of a	
	
	
	
	
Use of an
a GATT round	
	
	
	
an IMF project
a WTO rule	
	
	
	
	
an EU scheme
a Master’s degree	
	
	
	
an M.Sc. degree
a United Nations (UN) initiative	
	
an umbrella organization
a planned economy	
	
	
	
an economic plan
To decide whether to use a or an, the rule is:
Use a when the next word begins with a consonant (e.g. a crisis) or a voiced vowel (e.g. a European, 
where Eu is pronounced ‘Yu’).
Use an when the next word begins with an unvoiced vowel (a, e, i, o, u, e.g. an equilibrium) or a vowel 
sound (as in an M.Sc, i.e. M is pronounced ‘eM’).
Note:	
a or an historic event can both be used, but possibly an is somewhat old-fashioned these days 
(for a more detailed explanation, see Chapter 5, Section 4.72).
Abbreviations
Establish any abbreviations for frequently-used terms (FUTs) (terms used more than five times) when 
such FUTs are first used, and then stick to that abbreviation within one chapter. Do not keep switching 
between the ‘frequently-used term’ in full and the abbreviation (FUT). In later chapters, it may be 
necessary to re-establish the FUT in full again, in case the reader has forgotten its meaning. If there are 
many abbreviations, provide a Glossary of Terms with the dissertation.
e.g.	
‘We will call these utility-maximizing owners, or UMs…UM owners are willing to accept a lower 
financial return on their winery. Profit-maximizing owners (PMs) care solely about financial 
return from the winery.’ (Quote from a published paper in the Journal of Industrial Economics – 
hereafter JIE – 50 (4): 435.)
Some abbreviations habitually take the definite article:
	
the OECD
	
the BBC
	
the US

others drop it:
	
GATT
	
UNESCO
	
NAFTA
Note: In a number of published works, I have seen the List of Abbreviations incorrectly called the List 
of Acronyms, but the latter are only those abbreviations which have, over the course of time, become a 
word in common use, such as radar, Aids.
See, e.g., Niamh A. O’Sullivan, Social Accountability and the Finance Sector: The Case of Equator Principles 
(EP) Institutionalisation, Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2010, p. xiii. (Nevertheless, this thesis 
was awarded a cum laude, and was a good example of fluent writing for those in the field of corporate 
social responsibility.)
About/On?
In formal texts, use on:
e.g.	
He gave a lecture on industrial organization [rather than about].
	
He wrote a book on industrial organization [‘a book about’ could be used for, say, a children's 
book].
Active/Passive voice?
In general, try to use the active voice. It produces shorter, more vigorous sentences.
Stylistically:	
The factory employs 500 people.
is better than:	 500 people are employed by the factory.
However, there is a place for the passive voice in academic and scientific writing; for instance, if we want 
to emphasize the ‘agent’: 
e.g.	
In Bangalore, beautiful silk cloth is made in factories by women who work long hours in appalling 
conditions.
(Here the ‘agent’ to be emphasized is the women who work in a sub-standard industrial environment.) 
And, where we are not interested in the ‘agent’ but only in the action, the passive can also be used:
e.g.	
Numerous books have been written on the theory of the firm.
Advice
One gives advice (not an advice) (and not advise, which is a verb).
All right is the correct form (NOT alright).
All together/Altogether
These have separate meanings:
e.g.	
Taken all together [i.e. as a whole], his writings are a tour de force.
	
This hypothesis is not altogether [i.e. completely] valid.

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Also/Already
These two words are often misplaced in a sentence.
Also is often placed at the beginning of a sentence when it more comfortably belongs in the body of 
the sentence:
e.g.	
The superconductor industry also provides components for the computer industry.
Placed at the beginning of this sentence, also could be ambiguous [i.e. meaning ‘in addition to what has 
just been said…’].
Also is often placed out of order within the sentence:
Transport is a derived demand but its evolution also determines [not: determines also] the 
welfare of regions or nations.
The position of already is even more crucial if a sentence is to sound and read like natural English: 
e.g.	
We have already seen on p. 53 that social costs diverge [not: seen already or diverge already – 
these are not English rhythms].
(See also the entry for two other misplaced words Often/Only.)
Alternate/Alternative
These words are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably:
Alternate means ‘taking turns’:
e.g. 	
Two distinct fish-harvesting policies are being followed in alternate years.
Alternative means ‘different’ or ‘another’.
e.g.	
‘Organisation theorists have criticised the profit model and have suggested an alternative  
[not alternate] theory called satisficing’ (Richard G. Lipsey, An Introduction to Positive Economics, 
2nd ed.,Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1966, p. 397).
(For another good example of the use of alternative see the entry Instead of/Rather than.)
Note:	
It is possible to have several alternatives, not just a choice of two (as is sometimes believed):
e.g.	
There are a number of alternative plans for the development of Rotterdam harbour.
Although/Though
Though is more informal, so avoid using it in academic texts.
But, when used as an adverb, though can be a useful substitute for however if that word is being used 
too frequently in a paragraph:
e.g.	
The most powerful case, though, for the expansion of the EU is political not economic.
Nevertheless, as a first choice, however, is best here.

Amongst others/Amongst other things 
There seems to be difficulty in choosing which of these two expressions to use, even though there seems 
to be a simple distinction. The former refers to people, usually authors, the latter to things. 
e.g.	
(see, amongst others, Smith, 1999; Watson, 2001; Young, 2009)
	
He explained that climate change was caused by, amongst other things, human activity.
Amount/Number
‘Amount of cars’ is incorrect. ‘Number of cars’ is correct.
Use amount for uncountable items (amount of coal).
Use number for countable items (number of tonnes).
And/But
At one time it was not considered acceptable to begin sentences in formal (as opposed to literary) texts 
with And or But. However, a few years ago, the editors of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary ruled 
that this is now acceptable. In particular, it may be useful to begin a sentence with But to avoid undue 
repetition of However.

And/or
Do not use this construction, it causes confusion:
e.g.	
‘Once a subsidy is received, and the firm commits to undertake the subsidized R&D project, the 
firm can adjust its portfolio of R&D projects, initiating new ones and/or closing old ones’ (JIE 
50 (4): 372).
It would be better to amend the last phrase of this sentence as follows:
‘initiating new ones, closing old ones, or taking both these measures’.
Another
Note the correct use of another when mentioning two equal quantities of the same thing:
e.g.	
In order to strengthen the balance sheets of banks, the British Government announced it was 
prepared to provide £25 billion in ordinary shares and another £25 billion in preference shares. 
Another should not be used if the second amount is higher or lower than the first amount. 
Apostrophes
Note that, for names ending in ‘s’, the possessive form normally has another ‘s’ after the apostrophe, viz.:
	
Walras’s
	
Jevons’s
	
Philips’s
	
(Also: Marx’s)
As exceptions, Taggart and Wines (2008: 17) advise that: ‘If the last syllable [of a name] is pronounced 
-iz or -eeze, stick to s’, don’t add the extra s.’ This probably explains why in economics texts Hedges’ 
theorem has no extra s. 
Take care to distinguish between the singular and the plural when using apostrophes:
e.g.	
consumers’ surplus; prisoner’s dilemma; Arrow’s theorem
At the moment
This phrase may refer both to ‘now’, i.e. at this very instant, and to a slightly longer stretch of present time:
e.g.	
At the moment, I am writing this entry for the guide [meaning ‘Just now’).
	
At the moment, the world is in a state of financial crisis [meaning ‘at the present time’, as in the 
Dutch ‘op dit moment’].
	
At the moment, it is not possible to implement this architecture, because there is no consensus 
about a database model for dynamic incident-specific information [sentence from a draft M. 
Phil. thesis] [meaning ‘in the current period’].
Sometimes, EFL students write On the moment, which is incorrect.

Based on/On the basis of
Based on is often used incorrectly, when On the basis of should be used. Note the difference:
e.g.	
On the basis of [not: Based on] our findings, it can be concluded that the economy is growing.
Unfortunately, their findings are based on spurious data.
As a rule, based on follows the verb ‘to be’ (as above), or a noun:
e.g.	
an economic plan, based on that of Germany
Begin/Start/Commence
Where do I begin? Where shall I start? Let battle commence! These three idiomatic expressions 
demonstrate both the problem with, and the solution for, using these three different verbs which have 
the same meaning. 
I have picked up a general consensus among non-native English users that start is preferable to begin. 
However, after consulting a number of sources, I can find no evidence for this. The original Fowler’s 
Modern English Usage (1926) sees no difference between begin and start, but Burchfield’s (1998: 163) 
The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage begs to differ, advising that: 
‘It is a sound rule to use “begin” in all ordinary contexts unless “start” is customary (the engine 
started right away; he starts work at 9 am; the game started on time).’
So let us accept this latest advice and give preference to begin: 
e.g.	
The construction of the airport began in the 1920s.
	
The conference begins this week. 
That said, if a future situation is envisaged, start seems more natural:
e.g.	
The construction of the third runway at Heathrow is not likely to start in the near future.
Commence is used in formal situations (e.g. concerning the law, military hostilities, and religious and 
state ceremonies (see the first line of this entry).
Benefited/Benefitted
Both are correct, stick to one form in your text.
Besides
Non-native writers of English often use the phrase Next to at the beginning of a sentence, when they 
really mean Besides, in the sense of ‘As well as’. The confusion arises because Next to is the same as Beside 
(without an ‘s’ at the end) in English, but that is a completely different word from Besides.

Contrast:	
Besides [i.e. As well as] being a net importer of oil, the US is also a net importer of 
computer components.
with:	
 	
The oilfield is situated beside [i.e. next to] the Gulf.
Note that: 	
1) Besides is sometimes used incorrectly to mean ‘Alternatively’. 
	
	
2) Besides, (followed by a comma) can also be used at the beginning of a sentence (to 
mean: ‘Additionally’, ‘In addition’, ‘Further’, ‘Furthermore’), but it should be avoided 
in academic texts, as it is too colloquial.
Between/Among (Amongst)
As a general rule, use between when two parties are involved in an allocation, and among (amongst) 
when there are more than two. However, it is also quite acceptable to use between where more than two 
parties are concerned, but each is treated individually, as in the first of these examples:
e.g.	
An agreement to integrate production was made between all the firms on the Kalenborg model 
industrial estate.
	
The EU Regional Fund is divided among (amongst) all the Member States.
Even experts on grammar disagree among (amongst) themselves.
Bryson (2002) makes the distinction between ‘reciprocal’ (use between) and ‘collective’ (use among/ 
amongst).

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Note that there is no need to worry about whether to use among or amongst. Both can be used, though 
amongst is mainly British usage.
EFL students occasionally write ‘between x to y’, but it is correct to say ‘between x and y’: 
e.g. 	
Incorrect:	
between 100 to 200 persons per acre
	
Correct:	
between 100 and 200 persons per acre
	
Correct:	
Because of the world fuel shortage, the rise in fuel prices this year will be between 
20 and 30 per cent. 
Note also the distinct difference in meaning between the following sentences: 
e.g.	
World population is expected to rise to between 11 and 12 billion.
	
(The actual increase is not known unless the initial level is known.)
 	
World population is expected to rise by between 11 billion and 12 billion [an awkwardly phrased, 
but not incorrect, sentence written by an EFL economics student].
	
(This means ‘a rise of more than 11 but less than 12 billion’.) 
	
However, in this case, it would be better to say: 
	
World population is expected to rise by 11 to 12 billion. 
Bibliographies
Keep bibliographies as simple as possible, i.e. minimizing use of commas, brackets and full-stops. They 
must be scrupulously consistent. An inconsistent bibliography reflects a disorganized mind and could 
be an indication of sloppy thinking in the dissertation itself. It sounds obvious, but all references cited 
in the text should be included in the Bibliography, and vice versa. It is surprising how rarely this occurs 
in texts that I edit.
The following is an example of a ‘minimalist’ way of presenting a bibliography, with punctuation pared 
down to the bare essentials. It comes from a publication of Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, a leading 
academic publishing house:
Hornik K., Stinchcombe M. and White H. 1989. Multilayer feedforward networks are universal 
approximators. Neural Networks, 2: 359–66.
Le Cun Y., Denker J.S. and Solla S.A. 1990. Optimal brain damage, in Touretzky, D.S. (ed.) Advances in 
Neural Information Processing, San Mateo, Morgan Kaufmann, 598–605.
Learner, E.E. 1979: Specification Searches, Wiley, New York.
Moody J. 1992. Generalization, weight decay and architecture selection for nonlinear learning systems, in 
Moody J., Hanson J. and Lippmann R. (eds.) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Morgan 
Kaufmann, San Mateo, 471–79.

Openshaw S. 1988. Building an automated modelling system to explore a universe of spatial interaction 
models, Geographical Analysis, 20, 1: 31–46.
Openshaw S. 1993. Modelling spatial interaction using a neural net, in Fischer M.M. and Nijkamp P. (eds.) 
Geographical Information Systems, Spatial Modelling, and Policy Evaluation, Springer, Berlin, 147–64.
Note:
1)	 The inconsistency in the punctuation of the entries for Learner, E.E. 1979, and Touretzky, 
D.S., where a comma occurs after the name instead of a space;
2)	 The inconsistent order of the publisher and place: in the second reference it is San Mateo, 
Morgan Kaufmann, while in the fourth reference it is Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo;
3)	 Page references for journals are preceded by a colon ( : ); page references for books are 
preceded by a comma ( , ). This is actually common practice but it could be simplified by 
using a colon ( : ) for both journal and book entries.
4)	 The abbreviation (eds) should not end in a full stop, but (ed.) should because d is not the 
last letter of the whole word editors. However, the style guide of Cambridge University Press 
instructs that both ed. and eds. should have a full stop. Where an abbreviation ends with the 
last letter of the whole word, usually no full stop is used (Dr, Mr).
5)	 There is one other inconsistency. Can you spot it? (Answer: p. 187)
(See also Chapter 3 of this guide, The Finishing Touches: 22 Basic Tips for the Final Editing of 
Texts and Theses.)
Big/large/great
Big often sounds too informal, but in economic texts can be quite acceptable: big business, a big rise in 
employment.
Big and large are associated with concrete nouns, e.g. big/large deficits, big/large subsidies, whereas 
great is associated with abstract nouns, e.g. great hope, the Great Depression (one would not say the 
Big/Large Depression).
However, there are occasions where all three of these words can be used interchangeably: big/large/great 
increase or fall; big/large/great number or amount.
Obviously, this is a big subject (one case where large or great will not do)!

Both…and
Do not write ‘both…as well as’, a common error: the construction is always ‘both…and’. The following 
quotation from a Dutch Ph.D. thesis illustrates this error (which was repeated twice on one page):
e.g.	
Abnormal share price changes after personal share purchases reflect both new information as 
well as market mispricing’ (David Veenman, Insider Trading. The Interrelation between Accounting 
Information, Stock Prices, and Reported Insider Trades, Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam, 
2010, p. 164).
This should read:
	
‘…both new information and market mispricing… ’
Both to/to both
With this construction, as often with English style, it is important to achieve balance:
e.g.	
 Fish stocks in the North Sea are related to both food supply and fishing rates.
or:	
 Fish stocks in the North Sea are related both to food supply and to fishing rates.
Both these sentences are correct, but what people tend to write, incorrectly, is:
e.g.	
 Fish stocks in the North Sea are related both to food supply and fishing rates.
or:	
 Fish stocks in the North Sea are related to both food supply and to fishing rates.

British and American spelling
In terms of style and grammar, there is virtually no difference between texts written by British and 
American academics. Spelling can differ, however, and a text should be produced with one consistent 
type of spelling, not a mixture. Here are a few examples of British/American English spellings found in 
economics texts:

* 	
Note: the spelling of the noun ‘practice’ is the same in Br./Am. English.
** 	
Note: rigorous, vigorous are identical in Br./Am. spelling. 
*** 	
Note: American spelling uses fewer hyphens, e.g. (Am.) nonlinear, (Br.) non-linear; 
(Am.) quasispecies, (Br.) quasi-species.
Capital letters
Use capital letters for Part I (etc.), Chapter 1 (etc.), Section 1 (etc.), Appendix 1 (etc.), Figure 1 (etc.), 
Table 1 (etc.) (e.g. in Chapters 1 and 2), but NOT when referring to ‘this chapter’, ‘this section’ (etc.).
Centred around
This expression is frequently encountered in texts produced by non-native speakers, but is dismissed by 
The Chicago Manual of Style as ‘illogical phrasing’. The advice is to use centre on or revolve around instead.
Cf.
This abbreviation is often used incorrectly to mean ‘see’, when in fact it means ‘compare with’, when 
indicating a difference. So, ‘see, e.g., Wood (1970)’ means that Wood provides the point just made, 
while ‘cf. Wood (1970)’ means that the last point should be compared with Wood’s opinion. (For other 
examples of the correct use of cf. see Chapter 5, 1.A.5. and A.7.)
Commas
Sometimes commas are used when they are not necessary or completely incorrect, and sometimes they 
are omitted when they are essential.
These days, many publishing houses do not use commas after e.g. i.e. viz. cf. in order to reduce clutter 
on the page. However, all these abbreviations still need a comma before them:
e.g.	
The firm makes a number of products, e.g. pvc gutters.
Lynne Truss (2003) reports a current unwelcome tendency for, what she sarcastically calls, a ‘yob’s comma’ 
to crop up between the subject and the verb:
e.g.	
The Russian economy, grew last year.
Such commas should never occur, though I have come across them in the texts I edit.
(Note: ‘yob’ is English slang for ‘anti-social person’. Here, it is used metaphorically by Ms Truss to indicate 
an unforgivable solecism.)
On many occasions, I encounter commas incorrectly preceding that:
e.g.	
Those firms, that declined last year, have performed better this year.
Neither of these commas should be used.
(See also the entries Punctuation and That/Which.)

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Where it is appropriate to use commas, people often forget that they go in pairs in many circumstances, 
and they omit either the first or the last comma:
e.g.	
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the next budget, he would abolish tax for those 
workers earning less than £10,000.
The following is an example from a published paper where a sentence has a stray comma after ‘sample’. 
This comma is not really necessary and could be omitted, but if it is retained it should be balanced earlier 
in the sentence by an additional comma after ‘that’ [finds that, in]. 
‘…Busom (2000) finds that in about 30% of the Spanish firms in her sample, public funding 
fully crowds out privately financed R&D’ [should be ‘finds that, in…’] (JIE 50 (4): 371).
People tend to leave out the first comma of a pair (as above). Or, they may omit to use a comma between 
a subordinate clause and a main clause:
‘If subsidized R&D involves setting up or upgrading research facilities (labs), then the fixed 
costs of other current and future R&D projects are lowered’ (JIE 50 (4): 371).
Here I have added a comma between (labs) and then which was not there in the published text. The 
comma provides a necessary ‘breathing space’.
Non-native English writers may find it difficult to know when commas are necessary around phrases 
beginning with who or which, and when they are not. Here is an example where no commas are necessary:
‘These results imply that an owner who has just purchased his winery will price 5.5% higher 
than his PM [profit-maximizing] peers…’ (JIE 50 (4) : 453).
In this case, the who phrase is an integral, essential part of the sentence, and cannot be removed without 
the sense of the sentence being adversely affected.
In the following sentence, where commas are used around the who phrase, that phrase is not essential 
and can be omitted without any harm to the general sense of the sentence:
The female employees, who represent 40% of the workforce, have lower wages than the male 
employees.
I also favour the use of the ‘Oxford comma’, to mark off the last item of a short list:
Concrete is made of sand, gravel, and water.
The industrial categories are: clothing and textiles, glass and ceramics, and iron and steel.
These commas separate each item unambiguously.

Compared with/Compared to
Compared with is used when a contrast is being made, for example between two sets of figures. This is 
often the case in economic analysis:
e.g.	
Compared with the figures for 2000, those for 2001 are much lower.

Compared to is used when one is indicating a likeness between two things:
e.g.	
The Australian trade pattern can be compared to that of New Zealand [meaning that the two 
patterns are similar].
The most well-known example employed to explain the use of compared to is the line from one of 
Shakespeare’s sonnets:
	
‘Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?’
Though this has no relevance for economics, it is a useful aide-memoire, when deciding whether to use 
compared with or compared to.
An example more relevant to economics where compared to is correct is in the following context, where 
the sets of figures are hopefully expected to be the same:
	
One way of validating the results is to reaggregate the estimated data sets to the level at which 
the observed data exist and compare the estimated to the observed distribution.
The expression comparable to also refers to a likeness:
e.g.	
The Zwolle region is more or less comparable to the Netherlands as a whole in terms of distribution 
of firm size.

The following example (taken from an economics student’s paper) clearly shows within the space of a single 
sentence the essential difference between the use of to and with after the words comparable/compared:
e.g.	
‘Even though the level of external debt to GDP in Argentina was comparable to [i.e. similar 
to] that of other Latin American and developing countries, the level of external debt to exports 
was strikingly high compared with [i.e. in contrast to] that of other countries’ [parts in square 
brackets added – PE].
Confusion between certain words
Chapter 2 discusses 62 pairs of words which are commonly confused, e.g. affect/effect, discreet/discrete, 
because they seem similar.
Contractions
In academic texts, contractions (such as didn’t, doesn’t, don’t, haven’t, isn’t, who’s) should not be used. 
Write out the expression in full (did not, etc.). Contractions are too informal.
Could/Should/Would
It is sometimes difficult for non-native users of English to know which of these three words is most 
appropriate in a particular sentence. This is a complex area of English grammar and, for the purposes of 
this short guide, the following explanation is limited to the kind of sentence in an academic text where 
doubt may arise when considering whether to use could, should or would. In the sense of these words 
discussed here, this choice basically depends on the degree of probability.
(1)	
Could suggests a possibility, but not a strong possibility:
e.g.	
The proposed transport policy could solve the mobility problems in the region.
	
(See also the entry May/Might.)
(2)	
Should suggests quite a strong possibility (= ought to):
e.g.	
The proposed transport policy should solve the mobility problems in the region.
(3)	
Would suggests a very strong likelihood, or even a definite outcome:
e.g.	
The proposed transport policy would solve the mobility problems in the region.
(Note: In a completely different sense, would suggests intention, as in:
	
The author would like to thank Prof. X for his comments.
To say: ‘The author should like to thank Prof. X …’, would imply that the author is aware that it is usually 
polite to thank Prof. X, but, in this case, he is not going to because he has reservations about the value 
of Prof. X’s contribution to his paper.)

Dangling modifiers
This item refers to the need to put phrases in their correct place in the sentence. To illustrate this, consider 
the following extreme example:
Over the last 2 years, it can be seen that new UK graduates are increasingly setting up their 
own businesses looking at the self-employment statistics.
The misplacement of the last phrase (‘dangling’ at the end) implies, erroneously, that it is the graduates’ 
new businesses which are engaged in looking at start-up statistics.
More often, the modifier is left dangling at the beginning of the sentence, without being firmly attached, 
viz.:
Looking at the self-employment statistics for the last 2 years, new UK graduates are increasingly 
setting up their own businesses.
This sentence would be better expressed as follows with additional essential words (here in italics):
Looking at the self-employment statistics for the last 2 years, it can be seen that new UK 
graduates are increasingly setting up their own businesses.
The following bad example of a headline in The Independent newspaper shows how a dangling modifier 
can result in nonsense. In this case, the errant dangling modifier is ‘planned by EU defence chief’, 
misplaced at the end of the headline:
Headline horror
Sir: With regard to your headline (14 August): ‘Continent-wide force to counter 
terror planned by EU defence chief’, I hope that the EU defence chief has been put 
behind bars under the anti-terrorism legislation.
FRANCIS SHAXSON
Winyerborne Kingston, Dorset
In order to preserve the counter-terrorist reputation of the EU defence chief, the headline needs to be 
rewritten to eliminate the dangling modifier:
	
‘Continent-wide force planned by EU defence chief to counter terror.’
(See also the entry Squinting modifiers below.)
Data is/Data are
Data is commonly treated as a plural noun (data are). However, the editors of the Concise Oxford English 
Dictionary have recently ruled that data can now be treated as a singular noun (data is), according to the 
preference of the author. Data is sounds more natural to me, but to date it does not seem to be catching 
on. Whatever you choose, singular or plural, use one form consistently. (Note in the first Diagnostic Test 
in Section 2 of Chapter 5, data is is used consistently in the published text used for the test.)
A glance at some of the articles in the Journal of Industrial Economics reveals singular and plural use of 
data in different papers, and both singular and plural in the same paper.

Dates
Write dates in the following simplest way, devoid of extraneous commas:
	
15 January 2004
There is no need to write 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th (etc.). (By the way, never write, as I have seen, 2th, 3th, etc.)
Definite and indefinite articles
One could write at length (see Chapter 5) on the subject of the many nuances of the minute words the, 
a/an, but here only the main errors in the use of these words will be highlighted.3 
The most common mistakes made by students who do not have mother-tongue English involve leaving 
out the (in)definite article when it is necessary to use it, or, vice versa, putting it in when it is not needed. 
(Try the Diagnostic Tests in Sections 2 and 5 of Chapter 5 to check your ability to use these articles.)
The title of a monograph by a Dutch social geographer was ruined by the Indian publishers who printed: 
Informal Sector in Clothing Industry of Tamil Nadu. Though this was good Indian English, it sounds 
illiterate in both British and American English, where it would be: The Informal Sector in the Clothing 
Industry of Tamil Nadu.
Two other common examples of the incorrect omission of the are found in the following sentence: 
‘Marshall developed his theory of elasticity of demand in last century’.
Here it should say: ‘the elasticity of demand’, and ‘in the last century’.

The same problem of omission occurs with the use of a/an:
e.g.	
‘as result’ (incorrect), ‘as a result’ (correct).
Very important: Do not write ‘the trade theory’, ‘the general equilibrium theory’, or ‘the society’; ‘trade 
theory’, ‘general equilibrium theory, and ‘society’ suffice. However, when referring back to a specific 
society, like the Royal Economic Society, it should be called ‘the Society’ (with a capital ‘S’).
(As well as the two tests on article usage in Chapter 5, Sections 2 and 5, see the entries In case/In case 
of/In the case of; and The…of.)
Did (used incorrectly)
Do not use did as an auxiliary with a verb unless emphasis is meant, as in:
After years of indecision, the UK did eventually enter the Common Market in 1972.
But, as a simple statement, write:
The UK entered the Common Market in 1972.
EFL students tend to write things like ‘he did understand’, when the correct form is ‘he understood’.
Difference between/Difference compared with
These expressions mean the same, but note how they should be used:
e.g.	
The difference between x and y is considerable.
	
The difference compared with the previous results is striking.
Different from/than/to
In British English the usual form is different from; different to is more colloquial.
In American English different than is used, but that sounds wrong in British English.
Due to
Due to is classified as: an adjective (Concise Oxford English Dictionary); a preposition (Webster’s Ninth New 
Collegiate Dictionary); and an adjective (The Chicago Manual of Style). In fact, even expert grammarians 
are divided about the correct usage, and some grammar books do not include it. Academic publishers 
(e.g. Elgar) take the view that due to should only be used in specific circumstances, i.e. where it means 
the same as ‘attributable to’, when it is used as an adjective directly relating to a noun:
e.g.	
It is expected that there will be increased unemployment due to the credit crunch.
(Here due to relates to the noun ‘unemployment’.)
e.g.	
The rise in oil prices is due to the war in Iraq.
Here due to may be used predicatively after the verb ‘to be’ (here, 3rd person singular ‘is’) as it relates to 
the noun ‘rise’.

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Publishers’ editors would consider it incorrect to use due to adverbially (i.e. to describe a verb), as in 
the following sentence:
e.g.	
Oil prices are rising due to the war in Iraq.
In this case, editors would replace due to with because of or owing to.
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary advises that owing to is the better alternative, but also points out 
that the use of due to after a verb is now ‘very common in all types of literature and is regarded as part 
of standard English’. Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary agrees that this usage ‘has been recognized 
for decades’, but nevertheless adds that ‘you will still run the risk of causing offense if you use it.’
The misuse of due to is now so endemic that Burchfield (1998: 233), in Modern English Usage, considers 
it a ‘forgotten battle’, as the incorrect use has become part of the natural language. He quotes worthy 
publications like the Times Educational Supplement and the London Review of Books, whose copy editors 
have not corrected contributors who misuse it. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the correct usage 
should not be encouraged. The copy editors’ ‘Bible’, the Chicago Manual of Style, considers it is ‘better 
phrasing’ to use owing to or because of rather than due to in adverbial phrases. So this advice should be 
followed by authors submitting articles for publication.
Perhaps one day publishers will bow to the inevitable process of change in English grammar and accept 
due to in all circumstances.
(See also the entry Fact, where due to the fact that is an expression to be avoided.)
Dutch constructions
In texts produced in English by Dutch authors, I often find the following constructions which are not 
English:
allow to:	
when what is meant is ‘makes it possible to’, enables us to’, ‘allows us to’;
avoid to:	
when what is meant is ‘avoid doing (something)’;
prevent to:	
when what is meant is ‘prevent from doing (something)’;
suggest to:	
when what is meant is ‘suggest doing (something)’ or ‘recommend (something)’;
take care of:	
when what is meant is ‘deal with’ or ‘address’ (‘take care of’ applies to children, aged 
relatives, or hospital patients).
Editing texts
(See Chapter 4 of this guide which gives 22 basic editing tips to produce a finely polished text.)
Either…or
This expression is best restricted to two items (either a or b), though it can be legitimately used for three 
items (either a, b or c, but NOT either a or b or c).
(See also the entry Both to/to both, as the same ‘balancing’ rule applies here: you can say ‘either to x 
or to y’; ‘to either x or y’.)

Especially
Non-native writers often begin sentences with Especially, when In particular would sound more natural. 
Within the body of the sentence, especially and particularly are often interchangeable. These words are 
frequently overused in a text. Mainly or notably could be a substitute if this is happening, or consider 
whether these words are really necessary.
(See also * especially/specially in the entry Confusion between certain words.)
Etc. + Such as
Do not put etc. at the end of lists that begin with such as because etc. at the end is superfluous.
Note: There is no need to write etc. in full as etcetera, unless this is specifically requested by a publisher. 
Exists (There exist/s)
There exist/s is often used incorrectly when There is/are is all that is simply required. There exist/s is 
another example of a foreign (e.g. Dutch) construction.
However, there exist(s) is correctly used in descriptions of mathematical relationships:
There exists a function such that x + y = 0.

Fact (The fact that)
This expression is generally considered to be stylistically redundant. Use simply that, unless it is absolutely 
impossible to replace the fact that. The wordy phrase due to the fact that is also frowned on: because can be 
used instead. Likewise, despite the fact that can be replaced by the more succinct although or even though.
Favourite words and overuse of the same words
Check to see that you are not overusing a particular word or phrase in your manuscript. This often 
happens unconsciously but makes the text monotonous. Examples I have come across are: ‘consequently’, 
‘driving force’, ‘particularly’, ‘with respect to’, and ‘such as’ (and see the entry Especially above). In one 
text, the repeated phrase ‘as such’ had no meaning, and was superfluous.
One particular place where words are repeated is at the end of the Introduction to a paper, in the paragraph 
which describes the subsequent structure of the paper. Here are two real examples: the first uses a variety 
of nouns and verbs to describe what each section of the paper does (e.g. review, describes, tests):
‘The remainder of the paper will proceed as follows. A review of the existing literature is in 
Section II; a discussion of the theoretical implications of this phenomenon is contained in 
Section III. Section IV describes the data on California wines and the survey we designed and 
administered. It also discusses the general types of owners we find in the industry. Section V tests 
the hypotheses on quality and price generated earlier in the paper, and Section VI concludes’ 
[italics added] (JIE 50 (4): 433).
while the second repeats presents twice:
‘Section 2 describes the main features of R&D support in Israel and the data analysed in this 
paper. Section 3 presents the main conceptual and empirical issues that arise in the estimation 
of the subsidy effect while Section 4 presents the empirical results. Conclusions close the paper’ 
[italics added] (JIE 50 (4): 373).
The second presents could be replaced by provides, analyses, or examines.
(See also the entry Words and phrases to avoid using in academic texts.)
First, Second, Third, Fourth, etc.
It is preferable to use these forms, rather than Secondly, Thirdly, Fourthly, etc. at the beginning of 
a sentence. Also remember that, if you say ‘First(ly)’, then there should be a ‘Second’ point at least. 
Sometimes I come across ‘Third’ without any preceding ‘First(ly)’ or ‘Second’ highlighting the previous 
points. Do not start such a list without a good introductory sentence:
e.g.	
There are four main factors. First, … Second, …, etc.
Note: Because many publishers instruct the use of First not Firstly, it is commonly believed that it is 
wrong to use Firstly when beginning to make a number of points. However, it is not incorrect to use 
Firstly if you wish, but for consistency it should be followed by Secondly, Thirdly, etc.

Focusing/Focussing
Both are correct, stick to one form in your text.
Footnotes
These should be written as one sentence, and their corresponding numbers should be placed consistently 
in the text, either before or after the punctuation, but not both , i.e. either ‘…recently.1’ and ‘the town,2 
where…’, or ‘recently1.’ and ‘the town2, where…’. It would be wrong to put: ‘…recently1.’ and ‘the town,2 
where…’.
For example/e.g.
When the example comes at the end of a sentence, the abbreviation e.g. can be used:
Productivity per hour in the UK is lower than in some other European countries, e.g. Germany 
and France.
The same applies to an example in brackets within the body of a sentence:
Some countries (e.g. the US and Russia) are not committed to the reduction of industrial 
pollution proposed by the Kyoto Protocol.
However, for example must be written out in full if the removal of the example leaves an incomplete 
sentence:
There are many objections to intensive fish farming: it is known, for example, that fish reared 
in such industrial conditions have high concentrations of heavy metals.
Here, if the whole example is removed from the sentence, it ends in mid-air, truncated with no meaning.
Note: Do not use f.e. as an abbreviation for for example, use e.g.
Also note: Some publishers require for example to be always written in full.
These days, because publishers wish to avoid the clutter caused by unnecessary punctuation on a page, 
a comma is not used after e.g. But if e.g. is used in the phrase ‘see, e.g., Webb, 1990’, commas are used 
both before and after e.g. A few publishers specify that such a citation should be written in full: ‘see, for 
example, Webb 1990’.
Former/Latter
Avoid using these words if possible, because it is annoying for the reader to have to go into reverse and 
reread the previous sentence. But, if you must use them, then make sure they only refer to, respectively, 
the two items mentioned in the previous sentence:
Correct: 	
China and Russia are superpowers. The former is still a Communist State, while the 
latter is now a market economy.
Incorrect: 	
France, Germany and the Netherlands are market economies, while Cuba and China 
are planned economies. The latter joined the WTO only recently.

Here it is not clear whether latter refers to Cuba and China or just China, unless you say the latter two.
Incidentally, do not mix up the spelling of latter with later.
Furthermore/In addition/What is more/Moreover
All these words are placed at the beginning of a sentence:
Furthermore or Further means the same as In addition (or Additionally).
What is more is rather colloquial, not really suitable for academic texts.
Moreover means the same as all these expressions but is slightly more emphatic.
(The) Gerund
This part of speech, also known as a ‘verbal noun’, is well known in Latin, but it is also a rather tricky 
part of English grammar, even for native speakers. It is the present participle (the ‘ing’ part of the verb) 
preceded by the possessive form of the noun or pronoun:
e.g.	
With regard to the financial crisis, the government denied having anything to do with the banks’ 
collapsing. In other words, they refused to accept responsibility for their being in dire straits [the 
gerund construction is italicized].
People, both native and EFL speakers, often write incorrectly, ‘for them being in dire straits’.

Glossary
(See the entry Abbreviations above.)
Group words: singular or plural verbs?
In English, words like ‘majority’ do not always take a singular verb. In this first case, it does:
The majority supports the 5-year business plan.
But, in the second case, it does not:
The majority of the firms are run collectively.
(See also the entry Majority.)
The same rule applies to ‘per cent’:
60 per cent receives some kind of subsidy.
60 per cent of the firms receive some kind of subsidy.
In the following example from a published paper in the Journal of Industrial Economics, the use of the 
singular verb is incorrect:
‘A wide variety of instruments is [should be: are] used by governments to further technological 
change’ (JIE 50 (4): 369).
In British English, in general, the following group nouns can be used with singular or plural verbs:
bank
commission
committee
firm
government
public
team
However, in economic texts, the following group nouns are always singular:
bank
firm
team
But do not mix singular and plural verbs in the same sentence:
Incorrect:	
The European Commission do not wish to sacrifice their green policies in the current 
credit crisis, but it is aware that not all Member States are willing to go along with this. 
This can be corrected by writing:
either 	 	
The European Commission does not…its policies…but it is aware… [all verbs and 
pronouns singular].

or	
	
The European Commission do not…their policies…but they are aware [all verbs and 
pronouns plural]. 
Half (of)
In many cases, of is added unnecessarily after half:
e.g.	
Over half the population in developing countries live in rural areas [not: half of the 
population].
He/She, His/Her (problems with)
These days, it is not considered politically correct to refer to he all the time in a text (except in British 
legal texts). Some people go to the other extreme and religiously refer to she, whenever the choice arises. 
This is unsatisfactory as well. And even more so is a haphazard mixture: he here, she there, willy-nilly. The 
form he/she (or, if you must, she/he) is one generally accepted solution, but it looks and sounds awkward.
A good way round the problem, if it is practical, is to put the sentence in the plural.
Instead of: 	
In the firm survey, the respondent indicated his/her answer by a cross in the appropriate 
box.
Substitute:	
In the firm survey, the respondents indicated their answers by a cross in the appropriate 
box.
However, though not yet accepted by grammar purists, one can observe a new hybrid solution to the his/
her problem emerging in a range of respectable written media, i.e. using their instead of his/her, when 
referring back to a single person. This solution can be illustrated by amending the following sentence 
from a published article:
	
‘One might think a winery’s minimum quality represents something about the owner’s 
taste and their [in place of the original his or her] willingness to manufacture cheap 
products’ (JIE 50 (4): 445).
This usage now has the blessing of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. 
The Chicago Manual of Style advises that ‘he or she’ is preferable to ‘he/she’. A rather neat solution to this 
problem is ‘s/he’, but it is not widely used and frowned upon by the grammar purists.
However
There are two problems with the use of however. The first concerns its placement in the sentence. Students 
are often unsure where it is best placed. In fact, it can take a number of positions, depending on the 
particular emphasis the writer wishes to make.
There appears to be a misconception among both some mother-tongue and many non-native writers of 
English that sentences should on no account begin with However. And some believe the exact opposite.
However, this is not necessarily the case, especially if one wishes to draw attention to a contrast or 
qualification to a certain point that has just been made, viz.:
The coefficients measuring quality do not change significantly from the previous specification. 
However, including owner preference makes ‘age of winery’ insignificant’ [italics added] (JIE 
50 (4): 451).

When, as is frequent, however is placed within the body of a sentence, to achieve a natural flow, it must 
be in the right position. In the following sentence, however is placed awkwardly:
This estimate, however, is not significantly different from zero.
This would read better as:
This estimate is not, however, significantly different from zero.
The position of however in a sentence that includes not is more tricky than in the following positive 
sentence:
e.g.	
‘Note, however, that quality is well controlled for in the regression’ (JIE 50 (4): 451).
However can also be placed at the end of a sentence to underline a point that has just been made:
e.g.	
The G8 summit of 2005 had ambitious aims to end poverty in Africa. This is unlikely to happen 
in the near future, however.
Note that, when using however in this sense of drawing a contrast, it is always followed by a comma 
when it occurs at the beginning of a sentence. However, when it occurs mid-sentence it must have a 
comma before and after (see the relevant examples above).

The second problem with however is that it is often incorrectly used as a conjunction where it should 
be used with a capital letter to begin a new sentence:
Wrong:	 Population decline seems likely in all European countries, however, anxieties on this issue seem 
exaggerated. [Should be: ‘(…) countries. However, (…)’]
Nevertheless can be used in place of However if special emphasis is intended: 
e.g.	
Inflation rose in the UK during October 2012 because of the 200 per cent rise in university 
tuition fees. Nevertheless, this factor only had a small effect on the actual inflation rate. 
The word however also has a second meaning ‘in whatever way – to whatever extent’. In this case it is 
used without commas in front or behind:
e.g.	
However badly the economy is faring at present, eventually there will be an upswing. 
In this second meaning, it is also recommended to split however, into two words if extra emphasis is 
required: 
e.g.	
How ever will the car industry survive the current recession.
	
or
	
How will the car industry ever survive the current recession.
Note that this splitting only applies to the second meaning of however. 
(a) Hundred, 100
Write: 	 There are a hundred firms…
Or:	
There are 100 firms… (not ‘a 100’).
Hyphenated words
When noun phrases are used adjectivally to modify another noun, hyphens are required:
Note:	
the long run
but:	
long-run development, long-run equilibrium
Note:	
decision making
but:	
decision-making process

Hyphens are also needed to bind together words that are inextricably linked:
	
privately-owned
	
learning-by-doing
	
firm-specific
	
crowding-out (the noun only, the verb is ‘to crowd out’)
	
publicly-funded
	
trade-off (the noun only, the verb is ‘to trade off’)
(See also the general entry Punctuation for the difference between hyphens and dashes.)
I
It has been the practice in academic texts written by only one author to use ‘we’ not ‘I’, when referring to 
the author, as is the case for texts written by more than one author. But, according to the book Cambridge 
Grammar of English (Carter and McCarthy, 2006, Section 147a: 284): ‘Nowadays it is becoming less 
frequent for single authors to refer to themselves in the first person plural.’ Many authors rightly object 
to using what is called ‘the Royal we’ when they are the only researcher involved in the study. However, 
in academic texts, use the first person singular, I, only when absolutely necessary. Rather than ‘I found 
that…’, write ‘It was found that…’. 
I can legitimately be used in acknowledgements:
e.g.	
I would like to thank Professor X for his critical but constructive comments.
Even here, however, one could dispense with ‘I’ and say: ‘The author would like to thank…’
If-clauses
It is not surprising that non-native users of English often use the future tense in if-clauses that refer to 
the future. This is logical, but the English language is not always logical, and this use of the future is 
incorrect. Usually the present tense is used with if when indicating a future event:
	
The firm’s future will be assured, if the grant application is [not will be] approved.
In case/In case of/In the case of
Even in near-perfect English texts produced by non-native English users, there is still a great deal of 
confusion regarding the use of these three expressions.
Most commonly, In case of is used when In the case of is what is correct:
e.g	
In the case of [not: In case of] real estate auctions, bidders who have time-specific needs for 
property [they need the house now not six months from now] fall into this category.

In case is often used when it would be more natural to say if, as in a poorly expressed sentence like this:
e.g.	
In case utility functions are ordinal and non-comparable, we are faced with Arrow’s Impossibility 
Theorem (Arrow 1951).
This sentence should begin:
	
If utility functions are ordinal…
In British English, in case and if have subtly different meanings, as illustrated in these two sentences:
1.	 The firm has to lay off workers in case orders decline.
This means that redundancies are being made in advance because there is a strong possibility 
that there will be a fall in orders.
2.	 The firm will have to lay off workers if orders decline.
This means that redundancies will only happen after a fall in orders.
However, In case of and if are sometimes interchangeable:
e.g.	
In case of climate change, it would be best to take preventive measures now.
This is the same as:
	
If there is climate change, it would be best to take preventive measures now.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

But there is a difference between in case of and if in this pair of sentences:
e.g.	
In case of a sudden rise in interest rates, it would be best to take out a fixed-rate mortgage.
	
If there is a sudden rise in interest rates, it would be best to take out a fixed-rate mortgage.
The first sentence refers to a decision (to take out a fixed rate mortgage), which is taken now because of 
the possibility of an event (a rise in interest rates) in the future. The second sentence refers to a decision 
(to take out a fixed rate mortgage) which is taken in the future in response to a possible future event (a 
rise in interest rates). 
Accordingly, in case of and if are not interchangeable here.
In the event of is another way of saying in case of. 
Indeed
Like also and already, indeed is often misplaced in a sentence: 
	
Incorrect placing: The Chancellor did balance the budget indeed. 
	
Correct placing: The Chancellor did indeed balance the budget. 
Sometimes indeed is used when in fact is correct:
	
Incorrect: The figure shows that indeed global warming has been at a standstill for 10 years. 
	
Correct: The figure shows that, in fact, global warming has been at a standstill for 10 years.
Independent of
EFL writers tend to say independent from. Note this correct example:
e.g.	
One of the key elements of the CAP reform is a single farm payment independent of production.
-ing form of the verb (misuse of)
I have not seen this particular point addressed in any grammar book, but the misuse of the present 
particle (i.e. the part of the verb ending in -ing: e.g. resulting, underlying) occurs frequently in texts 
written by authors with EFL. The following sentences (from a draft thesis) illustrate this misuse, which 
is perhaps more a lapse of style than an actual error:
e.g.	
Radical innovations embodying alternative technologies have little chance to compete for massive 
adoption.
Improved: Radical innovations which embody alternative technologies…
e.g.	
	
To stimulate the liberalization of the electricity market, the government has implemented 
various policies encouraging market competition and supporting promising cost-
effective technology.
Improved:	
…has implemented various policies to encourage market competition and support 
promising (cost-effective) technology.
Insight into
Note this phrase, as, more often than not, EFL students write ‘insight in’, which is incorrect.

Instead of/Rather than
The choice between these two expressions can sometimes present difficulties for EFL students. The 
difference is, however, quite simple.
Instead of means in place of, as in:
e.g. The graduate student gave the lecture instead of the Professor.
Rather than conveys a sense of comparison and means ‘as a preferred option’ as in:
e.g.	
Freight is increasingly being transported on inland waterways rather than by road or rail.
The latter sentence shows why I corrected the following sentence in a draft journal article:
	
‘We exclude observations referring to [the tonnage of] container transport because the price for 
container transport depends on the number of containers transported rather than [originally 
‘instead of’] on the weight of freight’ [words in square brackets are added, P.E.]. 
Here a decision has been taken to prefer one measure as opposed to another.
Another example showing the correct use of rather than is:
	
‘Another alternative hypothesis that we want to address is that these hobbyist winery owners are 
selling their image and story, rather than the quality of the wine’ (JIE 50 (4): 453). 
In the last decades
I often come across this phrase in texts produced by Dutch authors, but it is not English as I know it. 
Either say:	
In recent decades [if referring to no more than the last 20 or 30 years].
or:	
	
In past decades [if a fairly long time span is involved].
or:	
	
In the last two decades [i.e. specify the exact number of decades concerned].
Inversion of subject and verb
This change in the natural order of ‘subject and verb’ to ‘verb and subject’ particularly happens after 
sentences beginning with the word ‘Only’:
e.g. 	
Only in a limited number of niche markets is it possible to build underground logistic systems.
Here, it is is reversed to is it.
Or when an auxiliary verb is used:
e.g. 	
Only in the Netherlands do so many people shop in the hinterland of small and medium-sized 
towns. 
Here, the auxiliary verb ‘do’ and the subject ‘many people’ are reversed. 
e.g.	
Only in A is the ranking order reversed.
Here, the auxiliary verb ‘is’ and the subject ‘the ranking order’ are reversed. 
Note: This inversion applies only when only is used as an adverb. There is no inversion when ‘only’ is 
used as an adjective:
e.g.	
Only settlements of more than 5000 inhabitants are defined as ‘urban’ in this study.

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Also after certain words with a negative or restrictive connotation, the subject and verb reverse their 
normal places in the sentence. This often causes difficulty in sentences beginning with Not only:
e.g. 	
Not only did the firm lose money, it had to close down [normal order: the firm lost money].
Note the addition of the auxillary verb ‘did’ in the inversion. It is this part of the verb which is inverted 
[did the firm].
With the verb ‘to be’ the inversion is more straightforward:
e.g	
Not only was the factory closed down after the pollution incident, but the managing director 
was imprisoned [normal order: the factory was closed down].
Other expressions to which this inversion rule applies, when such expressions occur at the beginning 
of a sentence, are as follows:
Hardly had the business closed down, when it started up again.
‘Never in the course of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few’ (Winston 
Churchill 1940: Speech, Hansard, 20 August [italics added]).
Only then did the factory compensate the workers affected by asbestos poisoning.
Only after the approval of the development grant did the prospects for the firm improve.
Scarcely had interest rates been reduced by the Bank of England than they were raised again.

Inverted commas: ‘Single’ or “double”?
1)	 Use single inverted commas to indicate economic terms (all examples are from JIE):
Is there an ‘additionality effect’ to R&D subsidies? (50 (4): 370).
This is the ‘selection on observables’ assumption (50 (4): 382).
The terms ‘company financed’, ‘private’ and ‘own’ R&D expenditures are used interchangeably 
(50 (4): 371).
or to refer to previously-defined terms:
Firms in ‘preferred’ development areas receive 60% of the approved R&D budget (50(4):373).
78% of the owners would be ‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ unlikely to sell their winery if they would 
get a higher return on the stock market (50 (4): 432).
or to mark a slightly unusual word or phrase:
The mean respondent does between a quarter and a half of his socializing with ‘wine people’ 
(50 (4): 439).
or to highlight the names of variables:
‘Ownership years’ is included separately in the regression [inverted commas added] (50 (4): 453).
Here, without the inverted commas, the sentence sounds ungrammatical because a plural noun (years) 
is used with a singular verb (is).
In this case, italic print could also be used to pick out Ownership years. But do not use italics and inverted 
commas together (so, NOT ‘Ownership years’).
or used around well-known words, phrases or clichés that are not actual quotations:
a ‘real-life’ situation
the ‘what if’ or counterfactual outcome
Single inverted commas are sometimes used to indicate that a word is not all that it seems:
The ‘gain’ can be calculated as follows.
Single inverted commas are often used around the titles of journal articles in a Bibliography:
Ballestro, E. and C. Romero, 1998, ‘Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Public Investment 
Decisions’, American Economic Review, 60: 364–78.
(However, see the entry Bibliographies above regarding the need to avoid extraneous punctuation.)

Finally, British publishers usually stipulate that authors should use single inverted commas (quotation 
marks) around quotations from a source cited in a text. For example, in Francis Spufford’s ‘fairy tale’, 
Red Plenty (2010: 5), about the Soviet planned economy run by mathematical economists, he explains, 
as I quote here: 
‘Because the whole system of production and distribution in the USSR was owned by the 
state, because all Russia was in Lenin’s words “one office, one factory” it could be directed, as 
capitalism could not, to the fastest, most lavish fulfilment of human needs.’
Note the position of the full stop inside the final quotation mark. This is because the quotation is a whole 
sentence. If only part of a sentence is quoted, then the full stop comes outside the inverted commas:
 One reviewer said that Spufford has ‘a piercing eye for historic detail’.
2)	 Use double inverted commas (quotation marks) around a quotation within a quotation, as in 
the use of Lenin’s words “one office, one factory” in Spufford’s quotation at the end of point 
(1) above.
Opposite to British English punctuation, in American English double quotation marks are used around 
quotations, and single ones around quotations within quotations.
Also note that, in American English, at the end of quotations which are not full sentences or after the 
title of an article in a journal, the punctuation always comes inside the final inverted commas. This looks 
wrong to British eyes, viz:
• According to Bjørn Lomborg, in The Skeptical Environmentalist (2001: 280), the IPCC 
modelling groups admit that their scenarios are ‘an attempt at “computer-aided story-
telling.” ’ 
• Boyarski, A. (1962). ‘On the application of Mathematics in Economics,’ Problems of 
Economics 4(9).
*  *  *
When quotations have more than 50 words it is not necessary to use inverted commas, either single or 
double. Just present the quotation as an inset block of text, often in smaller print than the main text, 
(see the quotation at the end of the entry Often/Only.)

Italicized words
In American English texts, well-known Latin or other foreign phrases are not italicized. At one time in 
British English texts, such phrases were always italicized, but now are no longer italicized. For instance:
a priori
ad hoc
ceteris paribus
et al.
ex ante
ex post
inter alia
mutatis mutandis
vis-á-vis
Weltanschauung 
zeitgeist

for book or journal titles mentioned in a text or bibliography.)

Italics can also be used to emphasize certain words in a sentence:
‘Another possibility for assessing the effect of the R&D subsidy is to look at the performance 
of firms after the subsidy has been discontinued’ (JIE 50 (4): 380).
‘Suppose that liquidity-constrained firms are more likely to apply for – and to
receive – an R&D subsidy and to tighten their R&D expenditures’ (JIE 50 (4): 381).
Kind of/Kinds of
Make sure that these expressions are used consistently with singular or plural nouns:
e.g.	
kind of model [singular]
	
kinds of models [plural]
The same rule applies to sort of/sorts of.
Less/fewer
The Queen’s English Society (QES), which defends the purity of English grammar, wages a continual 
battle for the correct usage of these words. The rule is:
Less is used with uncountable nouns, e.g. less coal, less money.
But note: less than 50 euros, not fewer than 50 euros, because 50 euros are treated as a total amount, not 
as a collection of individual euros.
Fewer is used with countable nouns, e.g. fewer cars, fewer people.
Informally, however, English speakers often use less with countable nouns (e.g. less cars, less people), 
and it is with this practice that the QES takes issue. Nevertheless, the rule is simple to understand, and 
the formal use of less and fewer is easy to apply.
Like/Such as
When a sentence involves a list of items as examples, it is not correct to begin the list with like.
Such as is the correct expression:
e.g.	
 ‘This can happen when, for example, some of the released resources from subsidising a 
superfluous project are invested in non-R&D activities, such as marketing, production, etc.’ 
(JIE 50 (4): 380).
Neither Bryson (2002) nor Gooden (2007) consider the FAQ: When should like or such as be used? 
But Guy Keleny in his Saturday grammar column in The Independent has addressed this question. He 
explains: ‘ “Like” means “similar to”, “such as” means “in the same category as”.’:
e.g. 	
Building Societies, like banks, are experiencing a time of extreme uncertainty. 
(Here there is similarity.)
e.g.	
Classical economists, such as Adam Smith and Ricardo, believed in the virtues of the free market.
(These economists belong to the category ‘classical economists’.)

Do not use tautological expressions such as: ‘like, e.g.’, and ‘such as, for example’: e.g. and such as are quite 
sufficient on their own – they should not both be used together.
Likely
The British and the Americans use this word differently but the meaning is the same.
British:		
The housing market is likely to improve in 2011.
American:	
The housing market will very likely improve in 2011.
Lists
When making a number of points in a sentence it is better to separate them by semi-colons ( ; ) rather 
than commas ( , ), because semi-colons achieve an absolutely clear division between the items. A comma 
cannot do this as effectively:
‘The group of wines in the $2.00–$ 3.50 range include many varieties: red table wine, Zinfandel; 
Cabernet Sauvignon; and Crenin Blanc’ [based on a sentence in the JIE].
In the original article, this list was separated only by commas, and ‘red table wine, Zinfandel,’ on first 
reading, appeared to be two separate items. The use of the semi-colon after ‘Zinfandel’; gets rid of this 
ambiguity.
The list above contains only short items, but when each item is long, or there is a combination of long 
and short items, the semi-colon is even more useful:
‘A bottle of wine is described by: its price; the year it appears in Wines and Vines; vintage; 
grape varietal; the appellation on the label; the quality of the bottle and its vintage; whether it 
is ready to drink; and a variety of characteristics of the winery producing the bottle’ [commas 
of original sentence replaced by semi-colons] (JIE 50 (4): 438).
When making lists of points, either full stops or semi-colons can be used at the end of each point. The 
rule is:
• If the point made is a whole sentence, then use, as is usual, a capital letter to begin the point, 
and a full stop at the end.
• If the point is not a complete sentence, use a semi-colon at the end, except for the last point, 
which should end in a full stop. 
• Sometimes, one finds, incorrectly, whole sentence points which, while beginning with a 
capital letter, end incorrectly with a semi-colon. 
• Use bullet points or dashes to highlight points. 
• A list of points should all be grammatically identical: either all whole sentences or all partial 
sentences (words or phrases), not a mixture. 
[This list is all whole sentences.]

Little/Few
The rule for the use of little and few is the same as that for less and fewer. Little is used with uncountable 
nouns: little investment.
Few is used with countable nouns: few managers.
(See Less and Fewer above.)
Looks like/Looks as if
Looks like is colloquial and is not suitable for academic texts:
e.g.	
It looks like rain today.
	
Global warming looks like the end of the world to some people.
Looks as if is more formal:
e.g.	
It now looks as if the Large Hadron Collidor will not be a complete waste of public money, as 
it is beginning to produce results.
Majority
Note: While the word majority is singular, it usually goes with a plural verb, but the following published 
sentence incorrectly uses a (3rd person) singular verb:
e.g	
‘The vast majority of the subsidies granted represents 50% of the agreed R&D budget’  
(JIE 50 (4): 370).
This should be ‘represent’ (3rd person plural).

May/Can
There is an important difference between may and can.
May implies permission; can indicates ability:
e.g.	
Fishermen may not catch cod in excess of their quotas.
[i.e. They do not have permission for this.]
e.g.	
Cod stocks can be replenished by means of quota.
[i.e. This indicates that it is definitely possible to conserve cod by this means.]
May/Might
People often find it difficult to decide when to use may, and when to use might: it is simply a matter 
of the degree of uncertainty. Though implying some uncertainty, may suggests there is more chance of 
something happening than might:
e.g.	
The output figures may improve [perhaps a 50% chance].
	
The output figures might improve [perhaps a 30% chance].
It is a common misconception that might is the past tense of may. In fact, they both refer to the present 
and the future. May well suggests a strong possibility:
e.g.	
The output figures may well improve [perhaps a more than 50% chance].

Because English is not a phonetic language, both native and EFL users have difficulty with spelling. The 
following are the most common misspellings by foreigners:

Where words in some languages are quite or even slightly similar to English, there is a tendency for

Months
Remember, in English, months of the year begin with capital letters:
January, February, March, etc.
Neither
There is confusion about whether neither should be followed by a singular or a plural verb. As in many 
cases discussed above, the difference is between formal and informal English:
Neither X nor Y is possible (formal = academic).
Neither X nor Y are possible (informal).
As a general rule, use a singular verb if the subject is singular, and a plural verb if the subject is plural.
e.g.	
This year there are no signs of global warming, but neither is there expectation of cooling in the 
long run.
	
Generally speaking, house prices are not rising, but neither are they falling in some parts of the 
country.
Important notes:
Never say: neither…or; always neither…nor.
Also never say: either…nor; always say: either…or.

None
People also ponder whether to use a singular or plural verb with none. The answer is singular in formal 
English, as advised by Leech and Svartvik (1994, Section 513: 263):
e.g.	
None [i.e. not one ] of the firms is performing well.
However, according to Bryson (2008: 294):
‘Although none can always take a singular verb, there is no rule recognized by any authority 
on English grammar that it cannot equally well take a plural one’.
Burchfield (1998: p. 526) agrees, and adds that:
‘…the choice of plural or singular in the accompanying verbs, etc., has been governed by the 
surrounding words or by the notional sense’.
e.g.	
 In my work as an editor, I have read many Ph.D. theses on economics written by students with 
EFL, but none has impressed me as much as the one I single out in Chapter 2 of this guide.
So far none of the many measures taken to alleviate the global credit crisis have been shown 
to work.
(These are my own sentences, using none has and none…have, following Birchfield’s examples and advice 
to consider context.) In the first case, one thesis has impressed me; in the second case, many measures 
have not worked.

…not only…but also
People often get into a tangle when employing this useful expression. The key is to achieve a balanced 
sentence structure. The following sentence does not have such balance:
e.g.	
The sample of respondents does not only include the firm’s current workers but also its former 
employees.
This sentence is unbalanced because there is a verb (include) after not only, but no verb after but also.
There are two ways to make a balanced sentence:
1.	 The sample of respondents includes not only the firm’s current workers but also its former 
employees.
Here, by placing the verb includes before not only, it serves both parts of the not only…but 
also…expression, and achieves balance.
2.	 The sample of respondents not only includes the firm’s current workers but also represents its 
former employees.
Here, the sentence is balanced, because there is a verb (includes) after not only and another 
verb (represents) after but also.
3.	 Not only does the sample of respondents include the firm’s current workers but it also represents 
the former employees.
This is yet another way of balancing the sentence by creating two main clauses with two 
different verbs. 
(For sentences which begin with Not only, see the entry above Inversion of subject and verb.)
Note: Do not put a comma before but also which is often done incorrectly.
Number/Amount
Students often confuse number and amount. The distinction is simple.
Use number when you can count the units: 
e.g.	
a great number of cars/people/trees
Use amount when there are no countable units:
e.g. 	
a large amount of money/oil/water
Number of (followed by singular or plural verb)
It is useful to know that the expression The number of takes a singular verb, but A number of takes a 
plural verb:
e.g.	
The number of firms in the computer games industry is not known.
	
A number of firms in the region are closing down.

Numbers
As a general rule, write out numbers one to ten in full, and write 11 onwards in figures. Ten is ‘transitional’, 
meaning that it can be written either as a word (ten) or as a number (10). However, Cambridge University 
Press asks its authors to write one to a hundred in words, so check your publisher’s policy. If it is the 
lowest of a series of numbers, e.g. five, then it is more sensible to write it as a number 5 because it looks 
strange to have one number as a word and all the other numbers as figures. Always write percentages 
in figures: 23 per cent, 5 per cent. 
Also, use numbers, not words, for: 
Chapter 1 [not one]
3 seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks
Offer/Provide 
(see *offer/provide in Confusion between certain words)
Often/Only
The positioning of these words in a sentence frequently causes difficulties. They must be focussed on the 
right part of the sentence, otherwise the correct meaning may not be conveyed.
The word often is usually placed before the main verb:
e.g.	
‘In the environmental debate, you often hear general discussion based on extremely short-term 
trends’ (Bjørn Lomborg, 2001: 8, The Skeptical Environmentalist).
(i.e. Here, often comes before the verb ‘hear’.)
When there is an auxiliary verb, often comes after the auxiliary:
e.g.	
In the nineteenth century, coal was often transported on canals by barges.
(i.e. Here, often comes after the auxiliary ‘was’.)
But often can also be placed at the very end of a sentence:
e.g.	
The fall of the pound against the euro is happening more and more often.
The placing of the word only is an even more delicate matter. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary 
advises: 
 	
‘…to avoid ambiguity, you should place the adverb only next to the word or words whose meaning 
it restricts’:
e.g.	
The town has only 6000 inhabitants
not: 	
The town only has 6000 inhabitants.
But observe how the meaning of the following sentences is changed, depending on where only occurs:
e.g. 	
The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave only a small tax reduction to low-paid workers.
[i.e. Here, only focusses on the adjective ‘small’.]

e.g. 	
The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a tax reduction only to low-paid workers.
(i.e. Here, only relates to the words ‘low-paid workers’, i.e. he did not give the reduction to any other group.)
e.g.	
Nowadays the British government only lends money for university study, whereas formerly it 
gave grants.
(i.e. Here, the British government lends money, but no longer gives grants.)
The difficulties with the positioning of only is well illustrated by the following example from Guy Keleny’s 
Saturday column “Errors and Omissions” in The Independent newspaper:
An odd little glitch afflicted one of the articles we published on Tuesday about the fall of Lehman 
Brothers: ‘Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley remain the only independents on Wall Street.’ 
That implies they were the only independents before and remain so. The writer meant to say 
that they are the only remaining independents.
(See also the entry Also/Already which, like often and only, are examples of focussing adverbs, and the 
entry Inversion of Subject and Verb which concerns the position of Only, Not Only at the beginning 
of a sentence.)

On the one hand…on the other hand (a favourite expression of economists)
On the one hand must always be followed, in the same sentence, or soon after, by on the other hand. 
e.g.	
On the one hand, a year ago the economic crisis was deepening, but, on the other hand, inflation 
was falling. [Note the commas on either side of on the other hand.]
However, a sentence can begin On the other hand, without being preceded by a sentence which contains 
On the one hand, but in this case the contrast is not so strong.
Often, students write, incorrectly, ‘on one hand’, leaving out the before hand.
But it is allowed, indeed desirable, to leave out hand in on the other hand when the two phrases occur 
near to each other in the sentence, as in:
e.g.	
This means that to determine the effect of risk aversion on the SCC, the climate-economy model 
should make a distinction between, on the one hand, risk aversion and, on the other, the marginal 
utility of consumption and the discount rate, which is not done in the standard model (sentence 
extracted from a draft paper by Jeroen van den Bergh and Wouter Botzen, February 2013). 
In long sentences, it is best to keep the second hand in this expression, as, by the end of the sentence, 
the reader may have forgotten the first hand.
Do not say, as is often done, ‘on the one side…on the other side’.
On the other hand/In Contrast/On the contrary/Conversely
These phrases are different ways of introducing a comparison, each progressively stronger. Students 
often use On the contrary to begin a sentence, when the milder, On the other hand will do. In contrast 
and On the contrary are fairly equal in strength, but Conversely should only be used when referring to 
a diametrically opposite position.
The following examples show how this set of four expressions should be used:
e.g.	
1.	
 The United Kingdom is currently relatively successful in restoring economic growth, 
after a long period of recession. On the other hand, its growing deficit on the current 
account of the balance of payments may lead to a new crisis in the future.
	
2. 	
In contrast to the USA, Russia has a rapidly depreciating currency.
	
3. 	
In the upswing of the economic cycle, it is wise to have a budget surplus. On the contrary, 
under conditions of recession, budget deficits are quite sensible.
	
4. 	
If prices go up, demand falls. Conversely, if prices go down, demand rises.
Own
There is a tendency for economics and business studies students and professors with EFL to say own in 
isolation, without specifying whose own:
‘Because the characteristics that make a firm a recipient of an R&D subsidy are likely to be 
correlated with own R&D effort, we need to control for this potential source of correlation’ 
(JIE 50 (4): 383).

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Here, it would be more literate to say its own, as it is the firm’s own R&D effort, which the author himself 
writes elsewhere in the same article:
‘We restricted ourselves to the effect of the subsidy on the firm’s own R&D expenditures’  
(JIE 50 (4): 378).
Parameter(s)
Do not use this word except in a strictly technical sense:
e.g.	
the parameters of the model
Otherwise, use boundaries, limits, guidelines, elements.
Percentages
Either use the percentage sign (%) consistently in the text for percentages (95%, 60%), or write per cent 
(or percent) consistently (95 per cent, 60 per cent). In fact, most publishers instruct that the % sign 
should not be used in the main text but it can be used in tables and figures. Do not, as I noticed in the 
article on the wine industry in JIE, in the space of one paragraph, write ‘five percent’ in one place, then 
‘10 percent’, and finally, ‘3.3%’ (JIE 50 (4): 376). 
(See also *per cent/percent in Chapter 2 Confusion Between Certain Words.)
Person of verbs
Do not keep switching between the 3rd and the 2nd person, as in:
e.g.	
When one is making a sample survey, you must be careful to ensure that it is representative.
Either use one all the time or you all the time (the former is preferable), but not both in the same sentence.
Plurals
Students from China, Indonesia and Israel tend to use the plural form of nouns (when these end in ‘s’), 
when they should be using the singular:
e.g. 	
Incorrect: The road networks is congested. [It should be network.]
Swahili speakers tend to turn words which usually have a singular form into plurals:
e.g. 	
breads, informations, equipments [It should be bread, information, equipment.]
Danish and Russian speakers do the same:
e.g. 	
her hairs [It should be her hair.]
However, words like bread, cheese and hair do have a legitimate plural form as in: a variety of breads/
cheeses, the hairs on the back of your hand.

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Arabic speakers, on the other hand, may (for numbers above ten) use the singular form when the plural 
is correct. This is because in Arabic one would say (in literal translation):
e.g. 	
The farmer has nine pigs and 20 cow.
(In English it would be cows.)
Prepositions (avoid using at end of sentence)
If possible, try to avoid using these parts of speech (e.g. with, to) as the last word in a sentence; it makes 
the ending of the sentence sound weak:
e.g.	
In Section 6, the concept of Cost Benefit Analysis will be dealt with.
This sentence is better expressed if with is moved from the end by changing the sentence from passive 
to active:
Section 6 deals with the concept of Cost Benefit Analysis.
e.g.	
 Consumers attain a higher utility, the smaller the distance from the product quality to the level 
an individual aspires to [sentence based on one in a draft Ph.D. thesis].
This sentence can be improved by changing the last part to: 
…the level to which the individual aspires. 
e.g.	
The papers which we now turn to [has a weak ending].
The papers to which we now turn [has a strong ending].

Prepositions (their use after nouns)
It is often not realized:
a)	 that two nouns cannot always share the same preposition; and
b)	 what is the correct preposition to use after certain nouns.
Both these mistakes can be illustrated with reference to the following flawed draft sentence:
The formulation of the condition here highlights the relations and the differences with ordinal 
equivalences.
Here, the author probably thought he was on the right lines because he believed that ‘relation’ and 
‘difference’ could share the same preposition (with), but this is not so. First of all, ‘differences with’ should 
be ‘differences from’. Second, ‘relations’ then cannot share the preposition from with ‘differences’, because 
‘relations’ is always followed by the preposition to or with. Therefore, the correct way to rephrase this 
sentence is as follows:
The formulation of the condition here highlights the relations to, and the differences from, 
ordinal equivalence.
A less technical example of this rule is:
The UK exports cars to, and imports cars from, some of the other EU Member States.
An example of a shared preposition is:
The UK has trade and other economic relations with the other EU Member States.
Presently
Bryson (2002) advises against the use of ‘presently’, or ‘at present’, on the grounds that they are redundant 
in a sentence. The same applies to ‘currently’. However, it is instructive to note that, according to the 
Concise Oxford English Dictionary, in British English ‘presently’ has two separate meanings: ‘1. after a 
short time or soon; 2. at the present time’.
e.g.	
Presently, the Chancellor will make a pre-Budget statement.
(Here presently does have a function, because if it were omitted it would be impossible to know whether 
the statement would be made sooner or later: meaning 1.)
e.g.	
The world stock markets are presently undergoing a sharp rally.
(Here presently can be removed without loss of meaning. It is implicit that the meaning is ‘at the present 
time’: meaning 2.)
The American Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary remarks that sense 2 (now) is ‘most common 
in contexts relating to business or politics’. Webster’s also says that many commentators have objected 
to this use, though there appears to be no foundation for this opinion. Webster’s quotes the example:
‘The fastest rising cost is Medicaid, presently paid by states and cities (William Safire 1982).’

Weiss (2005: 47) confirms this, saying that presently meaning currently is American usage. Webster’s 
provides these meanings: ‘1a (archaic) at once; 1b before long. 2 at the present time, now.’
Principle of Parallel Construction
This subject has already been covered to a considerable extent under the entries above concerning Both 
to, to both, Either…or, and, in particular Not only…but also, where the importance of achieving a 
balanced sentence structure was stressed. However, the same principle applies to groups of sentences. 
Here is an example from a draft paper I once edited, where the principle of parallel construction has 
been violated:
First, there is exchange efficiency. A Pareto-optimal position will be achieved only when the 
marginal rate of substitution between any two goods is the same for each consumer. Second, 
a Pareto-optimal situation will be achieved when the marginal rate of technical substitution 
between factors is the same in each use and for all producers, factor combination efficiency. 
Third, the consumer’s marginal rate of substitution between products must equal the marginal 
rate of transformation between products, economic efficiency.
According to the Principle of Parallel Construction, this passage would be better expressed thus:
First, there is exchange efficiency: a Pareto-optimal position…
Second, there is factor combination efficiency: a Pareto-optimal situation…
Third, there is economic efficiency: the consumer’s marginal…
There is one more aspect of parallel construction which is a source of error. In a list of items, if articles 
or prepositions are used, this must be done in a symmetrical way. In the following sentence the sporadic 
use of the article (the) is incorrect:
The Germans, French and the Dutch have higher productivity per hour than the British.
To make it correct:
Either use the article (the) only at the beginning of the sequence of nationalities:
The Germans, French and Dutch have higher productivity per hour than the British.
or repeat the use of the article (the) before each nationality:
The Germans, the French and the Dutch have higher productivity than the British.
Similarly, in the following sentence, the use of the preposition (on) is incorrect:
	
The JIT [Just In Time] deliveries will be made on Mondays and on Wednesdays and Fridays.
To make it correct:
Either use the preposition (on) only at the beginning of the series:
	
The JIT deliveries will be made on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
or repeat the use of the preposition (on) every time:
	
The JIT deliveries will be made on Mondays, on Wednesdays and on Fridays.

Note also the need to repeat which or that in two consecutive clauses:
e.g. 	
The rise in fuel prices which is now affecting all European countries, and which may continue 
in future years, is particularly affecting low-income families.
	
Karl Marx said that each should contribute according to his abilities, and that each should be 
paid according to his needs.
The same rule applies to who:
e.g. 	
Margaret Thatcher, who was the first woman British Prime Minister, and who won three 
consecutive terms in office, was known as the Iron Lady.
However, it is best to avoid making sentences in which words like which, that, when, where, who are 
repeated in close succession:
e.g.	
In the near future, when the polar ice cap melts, when global warming reaches a critical point, 
sea levels will rise all over the world.
This can be rephrased as:
	
When global warming reaches a critical point, and the polar ice cap melts, the sea level will rise.

Punctuation
The comma (,) has already been dealt with at length in the entry Commas above. 
One aspect of the semi-colon (;) was dealt with in the entry Lists, but this type of punctuation is mainly 
used to separate what are, in effect, two sentences which are very closely linked. One example is the 
very first sentence in the earlier entry Prepositions (avoid using at end of sentence). The writer has to 
decide whether the use of a full stop (.) would create too long a pause between the two ideas expressed. 
Here is another example:
It was necessary to conduct a sample survey; it could only be done by telephone.
The colon (:) is used when the second part of the sentence is an illustration or amplification of the first 
part. For an example, see my improved version of the long passage quoted near the beginning of the 
entry Principle of Parallel Construction. Another example is:
‘There are two types of inputs the owner may value: quality, s, that customers also value, and 
t (a wine-maker who has a French accent and costs more, but is not better than other wine-
makers) that consumers do not value’ (JIE 50 (4): 436).
Exclamation marks (!) should not be used in academic texts. They make the text look frivolous or 
pretentious. The reader is intelligent enough to be aware when a good point has been made, or when 
there is a remarkable result:
e.g.	
The R2 was 0.999.
not:	
The R2 was 0.999!
Hyphens (-) which link words should be used sparingly, e.g. when the meaning of two words or a string 
of words would be ambiguous without the hyphen(s). For instance, there is a difference between recollect 
(meaning to recall) and re-collect (to collect again: bees do this when making honey), and between 200-
odd citations (round about 200 citations) and 200 odd citations (200 strange citations).
However, it is not necessary to hyphenate expressions such as:
often used
frequently occurring
but the following expressions do need hyphens:
a 28-year-old male
three-quarter-hour intervals
(For more examples, see also the entry Hyphenated words.)

Explanations of Common Errors in Alphabetical Order
Sir Winston Churchill wrote that: ‘One must regard the hyphen as a blemish to be avoided wherever 
possible’, quoted in Fowler (1926: 255), who himself devoted six columns to the use of the hyphen). 
American English uses hyphens parsimoniously, compared with British English, but does use them in 
‘better-off’ and ‘worse-off’, where British English does not.
Then there is the distinction between the use of long dashes ‘ – … – ’ and brackets ‘(…)’ within a sentence.
Dashes are used when one wishes to make a quick aside (i.e. remark) that hardly affects the flow of the 
main sentence:
e.g.	
‘This owner’s net costs – financial and psychic – are lower than the costs of an identical profit-
maximising firm’ (JIE 50 (4): 435).
Dashes go in pairs (as above) when the interruption to the main sentence occurs mid-sentence.
Note: Do NOT put a comma after a dash ( –, ). Do not confuse long dashes ( — ), which separate parts 
of a sentence, with short hyphens (-), which link two or more words. (See Hyphens above, and the entry 
Hyphenated words.)
Brackets are used for a brief example within the body of the sentence (or at the end):
e.g. 	
‘We are not claiming that the specifics of the model above (quality and ability) apply to art 
galleries or other utility-maximising settings’ (JIE 50 (4): 437).
or for a long aside which interrupts the flow of the main sentence:
e.g.	
‘The “sister” premium is substantial (at the mean, approximately 40 cents for each quality level 
difference) and could be a reason for a winery to continue to produce high-quality wines despite 
unremunerative direct financial returns’ (JIE 50 (4): 448, Footnote 12).
In general, however, try to avoid long interruptions in brackets by making two sentences. Otherwise 
by the time readers have got to the end of the bracketed passages, they will have forgotten what came 
before the brackets.
Square brackets [ ] are used when an author makes an insertion in a quotation from the work of another 
author in order to make the quotation fit better into the surrounding text:
e.g.	
‘…this methodology embrace[s] and build[s] in unanticipated events and uncontrolled variables.’;
or to add an explanatory note:
e.g. 	
‘Some believe its methodological approach is as important as its content’ [italics are the author’s];
or round the Latin word sic, meaning ‘this’ (i.e. as it was written) to indicate when there is a mistake in 
spelling or grammar, in an original quotation. The following example of a rather amusing typographical 
error shows how sic is used:

In the Preface to the book Tax Policy in OECD Countries, Choices and Conflicts by Ken Messere, IBFD 
Publications BV, Amsterdam, the author thanks his research and secretarial staff, acknowledging: ‘Their 
good humour in coping with my bad hadwriting [sic] helped a lot’ (p. 4). This was, in fact, a typesetter’s or 
a proofreader’s mistake, but in this case it serves to strengthen the apology. Note the use of square brackets 
within a quotation. Here, it is necessary to add [sic] to the original quotation when citing it. Otherwise 
the reader might think ‘had’ is a mistranscription of ‘hand’ made by the author of this grammar guide. 
Questions
If these occur within the sentence, always begin the question with a capital letter:
The question inevitably arises: Should the fish-farming industry in Scotland be allowed to 
continue if its products are dangerously polluted?
Do not confuse questions and statements. There is sometimes a tendency to put question marks at the 
end of statements, when they should only be used with genuine questions:
e.g.	
Incorrect: The question is whether short sea shipping can deliver solutions to the congestion and 
sustainability problems? [This is not a question.]
	
Correct: The question is: Can short sea shipping deliver solutions to the congestion and 
sustainability problems?

Respectively
The expression ‘x respectively y’ (which is often encountered in texts written by non-native users of 
English) is incorrect. This is the correct way to use respectively:
e.g.	
For the years 1998 and 2002, the increase of production was 12 per cent and 18 per cent, 
respectively.
Short sentences
(See Chapter 3 of this guide, Notes on Style.)
Singular verbs (special occasions when to use)
It is useful to know that a singular subject takes a singular verb, even if the words: ‘with’, ‘as well as’, ‘in 
addition to’, ‘except’, ‘together with’ and ‘no less than’ intervene between the subject and the verb:
e.g.	
 Oil, as well as high-tech goods, is among the imports of the USA.
The CEO, together with his Deputy, is preparing the company’s Annual Report.
Remember that, if the subject is singular, the verb is always singular, even if the object is plural:
e.g.	
 The country’s main problem is too many imports.
Vice versa: If the subject is plural the verb is always plural even if the object is singular:
e.g.	
 Too many imports are the country’s main problem.
Note also that plural-looking words such as ‘politics’, ‘economics’, ‘mathematics’, and ‘statistics’ are (usually) 
treated as singular words which take singular verbs:
e.g.	
It has been said that economics is ‘The Dismal Science’ (Thomas Carlyle, 1850).
(But note too the following exceptions to this ‘rule’:
The trade statistics are encouraging for the third quarter.
What are his politics? 
On the other hand: 
What is economics for?)
So-called
Do not use this expression unless a negative connotation is implied. People often use it incorrectly to 
describe technical terms, e.g. the so-called greenhouse effect; so-called Pareto-optimality. Using so-called 
to describe these terms suggests there is something spurious about them. When making reference to 
economics or business terms, it is better to say: …what is known as the ‘Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory’; 
or: …what is referred to as the ‘law of supply and demand’; or what is called the ‘Veblen effect’.

The following sentence shows the correct usage of so-called in its true negative meaning:
e.g.	
For the security and prosperity of the population, there is a need for all countries to be real 
democracies, not the so-called democracies that exist in some parts of the world.
S or Z
This entry refers to those words which can be spelled with either an s or a z, e.g. organise/organize; 
industrialise/industrialize; mechanisation/mechanization; realise/realize. Both these spellings are correct, 
but within one text the author should be consistent, i.e. choose either the s or the z form, do not mix 
the two types. Some people think that spelling such words with a z is more suitable for scientific texts, 
while the s spelling is best for more literary texts. On the other hand, others think the z form makes the 
text look unattractive, too ‘hard’. One of the quality newspapers in the UK, The Independent, chooses 
the s form. However, it is a matter of personal preference. This is the advice given in the Concise Oxford 
English Dictionary (COED), but it does say in the introduction that the ‘s’ form is particularly used in 
British English. The ‘z’ form is not an Americanization, but is widely used in American English. The 
COED itself, published in New York, uses the ‘z’ form in its own explanations of words, and that is what 
is done in this guide. 
Note that, in British English, the word analyse is always written with an s. In American English, it is 
always analyze with a z.
The word fertilizer has only a z in American English. The words advertise, enterprise, franchise, 
merchandise, and supervise have only an s form in both British and American English.
Spellings that cause difficulty
Even with the widespread use of spellcheckers these days, misspelled words still crop up in texts. The 
following words are often spelled incorrectly in draft economics and business texts:
accommodate
commission
commitment
committed
committee
eighth
fourth (i.e. the fourth item in a series)
forty
fulfil (US: fulfill)
fulfilled
fulfilment (US: fulfillment)
height

Split infinitives
It is widely believed that there is an unbreakable rule in English grammar that infinitives (e.g. to determine) 
should not be split (e.g. to ultimately determine). But, according to authorities like Fowler, there never 
was such a ‘rule’. Infinitives can be split at will as long as it ‘sounds right’, and where no other place in the 
sentence will do for the adverb concerned (i.e. ‘ultimately’ in the example below). However, what ‘sounds 
right’ is a matter of instinct, which makes it difficult for non-native users of English to know when to split 
and when not to split the fickle infinitive. Nevertheless, this skill may come with familiarity and practice.
In this sentence, the adverb ultimately cannot be placed anywhere else in the sentence but must split 
the infinitive:
Multicriteria analysis enables the policy maker to ultimately determine the most-preferred 
policy option.
In the following example, however, it would be wrong to split the infinitive in the second sentence:
‘Cranes and crane operators, trams and rails, golf clubs and golf balls are all examples of 
pairs of goods that are complements for each other. The reader will be able to expand this list 
indefinitely’ (Richard G. Lipsey, An Introduction to Positive Economics, 2nd ed.,Wiedenfeld and 
Nicolson, 1966, p. 210).
To write ‘to indefinitely expand’ would not sound natural. For those who wish to go more in-depth 
into the complexities of the split infinitive, read H.W. Fowler’s incomparable essay on this subject in 
Fowler’s Modern English Usage (1926) (see the list of reference works that I consulted on pp. 8 to 12 
of this present guide). Gwynne’s Grammar (2013), although more recent, has a more strict attitude to 
avoiding the split infinitive.
Squinting modifiers
A squinting modifier is a word or phrase placed between two words, so that it is ambiguous to which 
word it refers, as in:
The Managing Director said yesterday the firm had lost nearly all its suppliers.
The meaning of this sentence is unclear: it might mean:
Yesterday, the Managing Director said the firm had lost nearly all its suppliers.
Or:	
The Managing Director said the firm had lost nearly all its suppliers yesterday.
Actually, I have only encountered this type of error once in an economics text, but it sounds intriguing, 
so I have included it in this list of grammar pitfalls, for completeness, as it is linked with the entry 
Dangling modifiers above.

Style
(See Chapter 3 of this guide, Notes on Style.)
Substitute
When using the verb substitute, great care should be taken to ensure that, if what you really mean is ‘x 
is being replaced by y’, you do not inadvertently say ‘y is being replaced by x’. This often happens.
Carefully note these meanings:
Substitute x for y [means ‘replace y with x’].
Replace x with y [means ‘y is substituted for x’].
The COED 9th edition used to advise: ‘The use of substitute with the prepositions by or with… is highly 
informal and should be avoided in standard English. The colloquial example substitute dairy milk with 
soy milk should be reworded as substitute soy milk for dairy milk.’ However, in the 11th edition, it concedes 
that, though with is ‘still disapproved of by traditionalists, this use is now generally regarded as part of 
standard English’.
Notwithstanding the advice of the COED, in economics texts, substitute by is the usual form. 
Once, an author changed his conclusion after I had edited his draft article, and used substitute the wrong 
way. This meant that, in the published article, the findings of his research were completely reversed! 
(The copy editor of the journal concerned did not notice.) The same thing happened in the last line of 
a draft Ph.D. thesis, but fortunately it could be rectified in time, otherwise the conclusions would have 
been totally at variance with the argument of the thesis.
Superfluous words
Why use two, three or more words when one would do perfectly well? This can be illustrated by reducing 
the following sentences (taken from a draft text).
Original sentence (before editing): 
This paper sheds light on how the rural world is opening to novel and challenging adjustments associated 
with a globalizing world. 
Improved sentence (after editing): 
This paper sheds light on how the rural world is adjusting to the challenges of a globalizing world. 
Original sentence: 
Farmers should be encouraged to continue to play a positive role in contributing to the maintenance 
of the countryside.

Improved sentence: 
Farmers should be encouraged to contribute to the maintenance of the countryside. 
There is a tendency to ‘over-egg’ the use of verbs:
e.g.	
‘serve to inform’, when ‘to inform’ is enough;
	
‘revert back’, when just ‘revert’, is correct. 
Weiss (2005: 34) provides a useful checklist of what he describes as ‘smothered verbs’, i.e. wordy verbal 
phrases that are best expressed by strong verbs, i.e.

Tenses
Do not mix tenses in the same paragraph. This especially applies to summaries and conclusions. For 
instance, do not say in one place ‘Author A said that…’ [past tense], and in another ‘Authors Y and Z 
state that…’ [present tense]. In the summary, do not switch between ‘it was found that…’ and ‘we find 
that…’. When describing the steps taken in the foregoing research in a chapter summary or dissertation 
conclusion, use the past tense. Always begin such summaries or conclusions with the past perfect (…in 
this chapter/paper/thesis/book we have analysed…), and then move into the simple past (…the results 
showed that…).
That/Which
A question students often ask is:
‘How do you decide whether to use that or which?’

The answer lies in the difference between British English and American English. The Chicago Manual 
of Style (15th edition, 2003: 230) advises:
‘In British English, writers and editors seldom observe the distinction between the two words’, and, as a 
British native speaker, I can confirm this. In fact, before I became aware of the American usage, I could 
not answer this FAQ. In American English, that is used ‘restrictively’, which means that the sentence 
does not make sense if the clause beginning with that is removed. That clause is an essential component 
of the sentence
(Try doing this in the penultimate sentence above by removing the words after ‘means’.)
Here is another example:
e.g. 	
In the ‘Winter of Discontent’ in Britain in 1979, when the dead were lying unburied and the 
rubbish was piling up in the streets, the Prime Minister was alleged to have said that there was 
no crisis.
(This sentence would end in ‘mid-air’ without the clause after ‘said’.)
In American English, which is used ‘non-restrictively’, which means that the sentence would still make 
sense without the clause beginning which:
e.g. 	
The Town Planning Act of 1909, which was the first Act of this kind in England and Wales, laid 
the foundations of British town planning right up to the present day.
(Here, the clause beginning with which and ending in Wales could be removed without any loss of sense. 
It is not essential.)
Note 1. In both British and American English there is no comma before that when it is used restrictively. 
But when which is used non-restrictively (see the previous example), there must be a comma before which 
and another at the end of the clause (or a full stop if the end of the clause is the end of the sentence).
Note 2. Although commas are not used before clauses beginning with that, there are instances where it 
is permissible and necessary to put a semi-colon before the word that; that is, when it is being used to 
clarify or expand a point (as has been done in this sentence before ‘that is’). Another example is:
e.g.	
Some British financial commentators are concerned that the pound is falling against the euro; 
that being said, this development could be advantageous for exports from the UK to the rest of 
the EU.
This sentence shows both where no comma is used before that (concerned that), and where a semi-colon 
should be used before that (euro; that being said,).
(For more information about that and which in relation to commas, see the entry Commas.)

The…of
Non-native writers of English often omit the the at the beginning of this ubiquitous expression, as in 
this published sentence:
‘Another interesting area for further research lies in how motives of subsequent generations 
of owners differ from those of the original owner, and the implications for evolution of the 
industry’(JIE 50 (4): 454).
It would be more literate to say ‘how the motives of subsequent generations…’ and ‘the implications for 
the evolution of the industry…’ [italics added].
Tons/Tonnes
Take care to distinguish between tons (imperial tons, i.e. 1 ton = 1016 kg) and tonnes (metric tons, i.e. 
1 tonne = 1000 kg). Do not write tons on its own unless you mean imperial tons.
Use/Employ/Deploy (verbs)
Employ is an acceptable synonym for use, but deploy is not always used correctly. Deploy is used specifically 
in a military context.
e.g. 	
The UN decided to deploy peace-keeping forces in the Congo.

Use/Usage
In an attempt to introduce variety into their vocabulary, some students often use the noun usage 
incorrectly, as an alternative to the noun use. Usage refers specifically to word usage (linguistics).
Sometimes, employ can be used as a synonym for use.
(See also *use/usage in the entry Confusion between certain words.)
Whether
There are two points to make about the use of this word:
(1)	
Use it on its own without adding ‘or not’, unless the sense is ‘regardless of whether’:
e.g.	
It is uncertain whether the G8 summit will be able to ‘Make Poverty History’ in Africa, as it 
claims is its goal. 
	
(No need to say ‘whether or not’.)
Whether or not the EU Constitution is dead, the euro will remain a strong currency. 
(‘Whether or not’ means ‘regardless of whether’ here, so its use is appropriate in this sentence.)
(2)	
It is correct to say ‘the question whether’ [not: ‘the question of whether’ or ‘the question as to 
whether’].
Which/That
(See the entry That/Which above.)
Which/Who(m)
Use which after inanimate nouns; who or whom when referring to people. Ideally both which and who(m) 
should be placed immediately after the word with which they are associated:
e.g.	
The Dutch economy, which has experienced steady growth for over a decade, is now in recession.
	
Ricardo was a nineteenth century classical economist, who was also a Member of Parliament.
	
The bank director, whom the Government asked to refund his enormous bonus, has refused to 
give it back to the taxpayers who bailed out his bank.
It is a common error to use that after human subjects when only who is correct.
(See also the entries Who/Whom and Who’s/Whose.)
While/Whilst
Dictionaries advise that whilst is chiefly British usage, but these days, in British English texts, while seems 
to be in favour and whilst sounds a trifle archaic.

Who’s/Whose (the main title of Philip Gooden’s (2007) book is Who’s Whose)
Who’s is short for who is, and should not be used in formal academic texts.
Whose is the possessive form of who, but unlike who, can also be used in association with inanimate 
objects:
e.g.	
 The Town Planning Act of 1909, whose aim was to secure the orderly and aesthetic development 
of towns and cities, emerged from the Garden City Movement in England.
Whose is allowed here because, otherwise, it would involve an unwieldy construction, viz.:
The Town Planning Act of 1909, the aim of which was to…
Note that whom, unlike whose, can never be allowed with inanimate subjects, as was done in one draft 
text which I edited recently:
‘Statistically significant observations are those for whom this ratio exceeds 1.6 in absolute terms.’
This should read ‘…are those for which this ratio exceeds…’.
Who/Whom
People tend to use who where, grammatically, whom is correct. Who is fine in informal speech, but not 
in an academic text. In this sentence, whom is used correctly:
‘This parameter is higher on average for UM [utility-maximizing] owners, whom we are able 
to identify from our survey’ (JIE 50 (4): 448).

2	 Confusion Between Certain 
Words
The following are commonly confused words, because they either look similar or sound the same. I 
originally made this list on the basis of actual mistakes I had encountered in students’ written work, but 
then I read two books: Troublesome Words by Bill Bryson (2002), and Who’s Whose: A no-nonsense guide 
to easily confused words by Philip Gooden (2007), and selected more such problematic words that could 
be relevant for students writing economics or business texts. I have acknowledged these ‘borrowed’ words 
where they occur in the list below, which is now a synthesis of my first list and these useful additions, 
but the examples are mainly my own.
* actual/actually
In English, these words mean, respectively, ‘real’ or ‘ in fact’, and should not be confused with similar-
looking words from other European languages, e.g. actuel(lement), actuële, aktuell, attual(ment), which 
should all be translated using words such as ‘present’, ‘current’, ‘up-to-date’, ‘at this moment’, ‘now’, ‘at 
present’.

Confusio n Betwee n Certa in Word
* adaptation/adaption
People are sometimes uncertain about which of these words to use. At one time, it was incorrect to 
use adaption. In the 9th Edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (1995), there is no entry for 
adaption, and then adaptation reigned supreme. However, in recognition of the increasing tendency to 
use adaption, whether or not correct, the 11th Edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (2004) 
now gives it a separate entry, indicating that it is an alternative for adaptation. Strangely, the entry for 
adaptation does not follow through by mentioning the existence of this alternative, as is usual when there 
is an alternative form. Nevertheless, it would appear that it is now acceptable to use either adaptation or 
adaption. But there should be no switching between the two forms, as is sometimes observed in student 
texts within the space of one paragraph. That being said, adaptation is still the form most commonly 
used (and, in my opinion, preferable). (See Chapter 5.5, p. 177, where, because of a quotation from an 
American source, both forms are used in the key essay.)
This entry illustrates the adaptability of the English language within the space of a decade. The language 
is never set in stone.
* advice (noun)/advise (verb)
When using the noun, people often incorrectly use the spelling of the verb:
e.g.	
This guide gives good advice; I would advise you to read it. 
	
	
	
[noun]	  	
	
 [verb]
* affect (verb)/effect (verb and noun)
The following examples show the difference:
e.g.	
The results of the study are adversely affected [i.e. influenced] by the poor response rate.
e.g.	
To effect [i.e. bring about] a change in policy at the shareholders’ meeting, it is necessary to have 
a two-thirds majority.
The effect [i.e. result] of the new policy is far from clear.
* ambiguous/ambivalence/equivocal/univocal
While Bryson (2002) draws attention to the confusion between ambiguous and equivocal, Gooden (2007) 
notes that between ambiguous and ambivalent.
Ambiguous means ‘not clear’:
e.g.	
 The results of the Stated Choice experiment were ambiguous. 
Many foreign students use univocal as the opposite of ambiguous, but this word is rarely seen in English 
texts. Instead, unambiguous or the simpler clear should be used. 
Ambivalent means being torn between two conflicting ideas:
e.g.	
He was ambivalent about the concept of climate change.

Confusio n Betwee n Certa in Word
Equivocal is the most negative of this group of words. It means ‘unclear in a questionable way’: 
e.g.	
Many reviewers consider the conclusions of Bjørn Lomborg’s book The Skeptical Environmentalist 
to be equivocal. 
* (to) analyse (verb)/analysis (noun: singular)/analyses (verb 3rd person singular, and noun: plural)
There is a tendency to confuse these words, especially the plural noun analyses which is often incorrectly 
used in place of the singular noun analysis. It is wrong to say: ‘The analyses was made for the period 
1990–2000’, when there was only one analysis. This error may arise because the oral pronunciation of 
the plural noun analyses (aná-li-ses) is different from that of the singular verb analyses (ána-ly-ses).
In passing, note that in British English analyse(s) (verb) is always spelled with an ‘s’, not a ‘z’ as in 
American English.
* assume/presume
Although Gooden (2007: 26) sees no difference between these words, I agree with Bryson (2002) that 
there is a distinction. 
Use assume when making a plausible assumption:
e.g.	
For the purposes of this model, let us assume that the population will remain stable. 
Assume indicates the creation of a theoretical context.
Use presume when there is more uncertainty:
e.g.	
As the dollar has been falling for some time, investors presume this trend will continue. 
Presume is more often related to direct statements about reality.
(For another example of presume, see the entry GDP/GNP in this list.) 
* assure/ensure/insure
There is great uncertainty about the correct use of these three quite similar words, but each has its 
particular use. As a rule of thumb: assure people; ensure events; insure things – all referring to ‘making 
sure something happens’:
e.g.	
The government assured the electorate that taxes would not be increased if they were re-elected.
	
By making a number of concessions, the government ensured the passage of the Bill through 
Parliament.
	
It is necessary to insure buildings against risk of fire. 
* belief/believe
The spelling of the noun belief is often confused with that of the verb believe:
e.g.	
The common negative beliefs [noun] about the impact of immigration are often not reflected 
in empirical research.
	
Not many economists believe [verb] that the market economy is best to allocate the world’s 
resources fairly.

* borne/born
These two words are often mixed up. Note the difference:
e.g.	
 The cost is borne by the consumer.
	
 The number of children born to women aged over 35 is rising.
* briefly/concisely
Non-native users of English often write ‘to describe concisely/shortly’, but ‘to describe briefly’ sounds 
more natural. ‘A brief summary’ is tautological, as by definition a summary is brief.4
One can say ‘a concise account’, meaning a summary of text which contains the salient points. 
* choose/chose
The first is the present tense, the second is the past of the verb ‘to choose’. Do not, for instance, write, 
as in this sentence from a published article:
	
‘Therefore, even if a winery does not use its own grapes, there are some constraints on the ability 
to chose [should be choose] an appellation’ (JIE 50 (4): 443).
* complementary/complimentary
e.g.	
a complementary [i.e. related] product
a complimentary [i.e. free] sample
a complimentary [i.e. a favourable] review

Confusio n Betwee n Certa in Word
* composed of/consists of/comprises
The first two of these phrases have similar meanings, but the third means ‘embraces’ and should not be 
followed by of.
As Bryson (2002) puts it succinctly: ‘The whole comprises the parts, but not vice versa.’ Sometimes 
people with EFL incorrectly write ‘exists of’ when they mean ‘consists of’.
* content/contents
Content refers to the subject of, or main theme(s) or idea(s) in, a paper or book:
e.g.	
Her supervisor had no criticism of the content of her dissertation, but had reservations about 
the English presentation.
Contents refers to the list of basic ‘ingredients’ that make up a whole book – the Preface/Acknowledgements, 
the chapters, sections (possibly sub-sections, and even sub-sub-sections), appendices, index, tables and 
figures. All these are set out on the Contents page(s) of the book.
* continual/continuous (found in Bryson, 2002)
Continual means ‘happening frequently, but with interruptions in-between’:
e.g.	
During October 2008 train services through the Channel Tunnel were affected by continual 
breakdowns.
Continuous means ‘happening without interruption’:
e.g.	
Temperature is a continuous variable. 
* criterion/criteria
The plural form criteria is often used incorrectly to mean the singular:
e.g.	
What is the main criterion for the success of environmental policy? [This refers to one criterion.]
	
What are the criteria for the selection of nature conservation areas? [This refers to a number of 
criteria.]
Note:	
The same problem (i.e. mistakenly using the plural for the singular) occurs with the use of: 	
memorandum [singular]/memoranda [plural]
phenomenon [singular]/phenomena [plural]
* dependant/dependent (found in Gooden, 2007)
Here, the confusion arises because dependant is a noun and dependent is an adjective: 
e.g.	
Parents receive special tax relief for dependants [noun].
	
The dependent [adjective] variables explain the independent variable.

Confusio n Betwee n Certa in Word
* discreet/discrete
These words are often confused.
Discreet means ‘careful’:
e.g.	
It is necessary to be discreet when handling sensitive government data. 
Discrete means ‘separate’:
e.g.	
An integrated complex model for decision-making contexts is developed, in which the choice 
between alternative discrete investments takes place under conditions of uncertainty.
	
A discrete variable is a distinct, indivisible unit. 
* economic/economical
The word economical is sometimes used incorrectly for the word economic. Note that ‘economic’ pertains 
to the economy, whereas ‘economical’ implies a tendency to be careful with money (thrifty):
e.g.	
The economic outlook is poor.
	
It is necessary to be economical with natural resources.
Note, however, the title of McCloskey’s (1999) booklet Economical Writing, which cleverly combines 
both these meanings. (See also Chapter 3, Notes on Style.)
* employ/deploy
These words are sometimes used incorrectly as synonyms in a misguided attempt to add variety to the 
vocabulary of text, but they each have a distinct usage:
e.g.	
Students are often employed as part-time workers [meaning ‘given jobs’].
	
More troops are being deployed in Iraq [meaning: brought or moved into position for military 
action].
Deployed is sometimes used in innovation studies to denote the large-scale application of a new product 
or technology. For example, the term ‘RDD&D’ is used as an extension of ‘R&D’, and means ‘Research, 
Development, Demonstration and Deployment’.5
* especially/specially 
Especially is often, but not always, interchangeable with particularly or in particular:
e.g.	
On average, England now has the highest population density in Europe, especially in the South 
East of the country. 
Specially means ‘for a specific purpose’:
e.g.	
a specially designed low-carbon eco-building

* eventual(ly)
In English, this means ‘final(ly)’, ‘ultimate(ly)’, ‘in the end’, ‘after all that’, and should not be confused 
with the Dutch word eventueel, which is translated as ‘possible’.
* evoke/invoke/provoke
Evoke and invoke are two very intriguing words, as in one of their various senses they do mean the 
same thing: to call on a deity or spirit, or call up a memory. This is the primary meaning of evoke and 
the third meaning of invoke. If there is a difference in this sense, it is that things evoke a memory, and 
people invoke a memory:
e.g.	
 The Normandy beaches evoke the memory of World War II.
	
 Hamlet invoked the memory of his murdered father.
In this sense, neither evoke nor invoke have much relevance in an economics context, but in their 
secondary senses they do. And this is where the confusion arises because these words have different 
secondary meanings. According to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary:
Evoke means ‘to elicit’ (a response):
e.g.	
When interest rates rise, this always evokes a response from the bond markets.

Invoke means ‘to call earnestly for’:
e.g.	
The protesters at the G8 summit invoked the ideas of the original anarchist leaders, such as 
Bakunin, in their demonstrations.
Because these two words sound very similar, it is easy to confuse them, and for the same reason they 
are sometimes confused with provoke, which means ‘to stimulate a sharp response’. 
e.g.	
The managing director’s indiscretion provoked a disastrous fall in the price of shares in his 
company.
* farther/further
Though the Concise Oxford English Dictionary indicates these words are interchangeable, The Chicago 
Manual of Style reflects their actual different usage in practice, i.e. ‘(…) use farther for purely physical 
distance (…) and further for figurative distance.’
e.g.	
The farther South one travels, the warmer the climate becomes.
	
 Ph.D. theses usually conclude with recommendations for further research.
* feet/foot
Note when to use feet: 
e.g.	
Standard containers are 20 feet long.
– and when to use foot:
e.g.	
A 20-foot container is the standard size and is the basis for the TEU (Transport Equivalent Unit).
* forth/fourth
Fourth (which comes after third) is often misspelled as forth which has an entirely different meaning, as 
in to set forth, i.e. to go on a journey.
* GDP/GNP (I was reminded of this by Bryson (2002).)
I include these because I was once surprised to be asked to explain the difference by an EFL economist.
GDP is Gross Domestic Product, excluding foreign earnings.
GNP is Gross National Product, including foreign earnings.
* geographic/geographical
I was also once asked to explain the difference between these two very similar words, but I think it can 
be summed up by the answer ‘same difference’.6 However, note the common usages:
	
geographic information systems
	
a geographical distribution

* homogeneous/homogenous
Homogeneous relating to homogeneity (referring to uniform composition) is frequently spelled incorrectly 
as homogenous: 
e.g. 	
The different models of commuter behaviour produced homogeneous results [correct spelling 
of homogeneous].
An example of the incorrect spelling of homogeneous occurred on The Guardian newspaper letter page 
on 2 October 2008, when a correspondent wrote:
‘To refer to an isolated criminal action as a huge and diverse population’s homogenous “anger” 
is The Daily Mail’s territory.’
It should be ‘homogeneous “anger” ’.
Homogenous is a biological term meaning ‘homologous’, referring to similar evolutionary origins (Concise 
Oxford English Dictionary).
* immeasurable/unmeasurable
Immeasurable means ‘too big to measure’.
Unmeasurable means ‘not possible to measure’.
* imply/infer
Imply means ‘to suggest’, ‘not say explicitly’:
e.g.	
He implied that the bank was failing but gave no hard facts.
Infer means ‘to deduce from the evidence’:
e.g.	
He inferred from the balance sheet that the bank was failing.
* insulation/isolation
Both French and Dutch students confuse these English words because isolatie in Dutch and isolation 
in French mean the same as insulation in English, i.e. ‘material used to insulate something’ (Concise 
Oxford English Dictionary). 
In English, isolation means something completely different, i.e. the feeling of being isolated (separate) 
from others, lonely. It also applies to an ‘isolated island’, one far from any other. 
* it’s/its
Its is the possessive of ‘it’. 
It’s is a contraction for ‘it is’.

* lack/miss
Non-native users of English often use miss, missing, missed, where they should use lack, lacking, lacked 
[meaning ‘do not have’]:
e.g.	
Many settlements in remote rural areas lack telecottaging facilities.
* lead/led
Remember that led (not lead) is the past tense of the verb ‘to lead’:
e.g.	
At the end of the twentieth century the rise of CFC gases led to the hole in the ozone layer.
(The confusion arises because the noun lead (a heavy metal) is pronounced the same way as the past 
participle led.)
* lie(s)/lay(s)
These words are often mixed up when the meaning to be conveyed is ‘can be found in’, as in the corrected 
sentence:
‘Another interesting area…for future research lies in how the motives of subsequent generations 
of owners differ from those of the original owner, and the implications for the evolution of the 
industry’ [italics added] (JIE 50 (4) :453).

Note:	
This sentence is an improved version of a poorly expressed sentence in a published paper in 
the Journal of Industrial Economics, where ‘the’ is missing in the first line (see the entry the…of 
below). However, the use of lies was correct.
If you remember that lay(s) means ‘put(s) down’ (on a flat surface), it will be less easy to confuse this 
word with lie(s) in its meanings of ‘is situated in’ or (as above) ‘can be found in’.
Another source of confusion concerns the past participle of the verbs to lie and to lay. Lain is the past 
participle of lie, and laid is the past participle and past tense of lay:
e.g.	
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer had lain awake all night thinking about the financial crisis.
The bases for the European Monetary Union were laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht.
* life/live
The spelling of the noun life is often confused with the verb live, and there are the added complications 
that the plural of life is lives (not lifes), and that live is an adjective, as well as a verb.
Note these critical differences in the following examples:
e.g.	
 (life, singular noun) Enhancing the quality of life is an important element of many policy 
recommendations.
(lives, plural noun) Many lives were lost in the tsunami.
(live, adjective) Too many small live fish are caught in fine nets.
(lives, singular verb) The commuter lives far from his/her workplace. 
(live, plural verb) Nowadays most people live in urban areas.
EFL students often incorrectly write lifes when they mean lives, both as a noun and as a verb.
* lose (verb)/loose (adjective)
Note the difference: ‘to lose momentum’, ‘a loose definition’.
* method/methodology
Method means a ‘particular procedure for accomplishing or achieving something’ (Concise Oxford English 
Dictionary):
e.g.	
He used two different methods to make his calculations.
The associated adjective is methodical, meaning ‘orderly’:
e.g.	
He was very methodical in his research procedures.
Methodology means a ‘system of methods used in a particular field’:
e.g.	
Ph.D. students often extend the methodology of previous experts in their subject.

Confusio n Betwee n Certa in Word
The associated adjective is methodological, meaning ‘pertaining to a methodology’:
e.g.	
His work has a number of methodological shortcomings.
* minimal/minimum
These two words are often confused with each other, although there is more than a subtle difference 
between them:
Minimal is an adjective referring to quality, while minimum is both an adjective and a noun:
e.g.	
‘A minimal amount’ is a very small amount.
The UK would like the EU to give minimal subsidies to agriculture in each Member State 
[adjective, i.e. an extremely small level of subsidies].
EU expenditure must be reduced to a minimum [noun], meaning the smallest possible 
amount (i.e. the minimum [adjective] amount), subject to the demands of lobby groups 
and governments.
* offer/provide
A very common error by writers with EFL is to misuse the verb offer when it would be correct to say 
provide:
Incorrect:	
	
In Section 2, we offer a literature review.
Correct: 	
	
In Section 2, we provide a literature review.
The primary meaning of offer is ‘to present (something) for (someone) to accept or reject’ (Concise 
Oxford English Dictionary), which is not really appropriate for a literature review. In another well-used 
meaning, offer refers to making a prayer or a sacrifice to a deity, again not the right word to use in 
connection with a literature review – or with research results or a summary and conclusions. In all the 
cases where to offer is often used incorrectly, and to present is better. There is, however, one instance 
where it is legitimate to use offer: 
e.g. 	
We now offer our own interpretation of the OECD survey results. 
Here, the idea of accepting or rejecting the interpretation reflects the correct meaning of offer.
* orient/orientate
These words are used too loosely. Orient should always be used, unless the meaning to be conveyed 
really is ‘position towards the East’:
e.g.	
This book is oriented towards policy makers.
	
Mosques and synagogues in Western Europe are orientated towards the East.
*partly/partially (found in Bryson, 2002)
Partly means ‘in part’:
e.g.	
The paper is written partly by Professor X, and partly by her graduate student.

Partially means ‘incompletely’:
e.g.	
The deadline for his thesis is at the beginning of May, but it is already April and it is only partially 
written.
* per cent/percent
Per cent is the British English form.
Percent is the American English form.
(See also Chapter 2 on editing tips, which explains when to use the % sign.)
*percentage/percentage point
There is a very important distinction between these two forms which is not always observed. Note the 
difference in the following sentences:
e.g.	
In the UK inflation rose from 3 to 4 per cent in one year, i.e. by one percentage point.
	
This represents a rise of 25 per cent.
	
3 per cent is a percentage – each per cent is a percentage point.
* prescribed/proscribed
These words mean, respectively, ‘recommended’ and ‘forbidden’ – quite opposite meanings!

* preventive/preventative
These two words have the same meaning but The Chicago Manual of Style recommends only using 
preventive.
* principal/principle
This is a very common confusion.
Principal meaning ‘chief’ is both a noun and an adjective:
e.g. 	
(as a noun) The Principal of a school [i.e. the most important person in the school].
(Here, Principal is a ‘proper noun’, starting with a capital letter.)
e.g. 	
(as an adjective) the principal city of a country
Principle meaning ‘a basic tenet or belief’ is only a noun: 
e.g.	
It is an economic principle that the demand curve slopes down to the right.
	
The precautionary principle
	
Marshall’s Principles of Economics 
* proved/proven
The verb ‘to prove’ has two past participles: proved and proven, and students may be confused about 
which of these forms to use. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary advises: ‘Both are correct and can be 
used interchangeably (this has not been proved yet; this has not been proven yet).’ Nevertheless, proven 
sounds rather archaic. 
However, this instruction relates to proved/proven as a verb. When the past participle of ‘prove’ is used 
as an adjective, only proven is used:
e.g.	
a proven method
Moreover, although proved is most commonly used as the verb form, in a mathematical context ‘proven’ 
is the preferred form in the passive voice:
e.g.	
This theorem is not proven.
but in the active voice:
e.g. 	
Professor X has proved the theory.
* ratio/ration
The confusion between these two words is probably because they are both associated with the idea of 
‘share’.
Ratio refers to the relationship between two amounts. 
Note how it is written:
e.g. 	
The ratio of x to y [not x and y].
Ration means ‘a certain amount of a commodity in short supply that is officially allowed to the population 
by the Government (e.g. food in wartime, healthcare, student finance) (COED, 2004)’.

* regardless/irregardless
Gooden (2007) states that irregardless does not exist, but it does exist in the Concise Oxford English 
Dictionary.
However, the simpler regardless suffices.
* sanction/(verb)/sanction (noun)
These are an interesting pair of words that look exactly the same but which can have diametrically 
opposite meanings, as both verb and noun:
Sanction (verb) means 1. ‘to give official permission’ [a positive connotation]:
e.g.	
 The governments of the Benelux countries decided to sanction a financial injection.
Conversely, it also means 2. ‘to impose a penalty or sanction [see noun below] on’ [a negative connotation]:
e.g.	
The EU sanctions countries like the Faroe Islands which do not comply with EU 	fishing 
quotas.
Sanction (noun) means 1. ‘final permission’ or ‘authorization’ [a positive connotation]:
e.g.	
In Russia, it is necessary for firms to have the sanction of the President for major investment 
projects.
Conversely, it also means 2. ‘penalty’ [a negative connotation]:
e.g. 	
The American government is threatening economic sanctions against Iran and Syria.
The positive version of the verb (to sanction) and the negative version of the noun (sanction – often in 
the plural) are most commonly used in practice.
* simple/simplistic (found in Gooden, 2007)
Simple means ‘easily understood’, ‘uncomplicated’:
e.g.	
a simple model
Simplistic means ‘making something seem less complex than it really is’:
e.g. 	
To say that CO2 emissions are the sole cause of global warming is simplistic.
* systematic/systemic
Systematic means following a fixed plan, or being methodical:
e.g.	
There needs to be a systematic reworking of the contributions made by each Member State to 	
	
the EU budget.
Systemic basically relates to physiological systems:
e.g.	
a systemic disease of human or plant organisms

However, it can be extended metaphorically to refer to problems affecting the operation of a public body:
e.g.	
There is an urgent need for systemic change in the workings of the EU.
* their/there
These often appear as typing, rather than grammatical, errors:
e.g.	
There is usually a rise in house prices when countries lower their interest rates.
* therefore/therefor
Therefore is often misspelled therefor, but the meanings are quite different.
Therefore means ‘hence’ or ‘consequently’ or ‘for that reason’.
Therefor is used primarily in legal texts meaning ‘for that object or purpose’, ‘in return for’, or ‘for it’. 
One might say, although it would be rather archaic: ‘As the UK gains little benefit from the Common 
Agricultural Policy, it has negotiated a rebate therefor.’
* to/too/two
The confusion between these three words often concern typing, rather than grammatical, errors. The 
following sentence contains all three words typed correctly:

Two countries had too much influence on the outcome of the negotiations to reform the CAP.

3	 Notes on Style
Academic language…is no one’s mother tongue
Bourdieu et al. (1994: 8).
Good grammar is not everything, however, as Noam Chomsky famously illustrated in his perfectly 
grammatical, but completely meaningless sentence: ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’ (Chomsky, 
Syntactic Structures, 1957). More usually, it is possible for a text to have perfectly correct English 
grammar, but which is nevertheless dull and monotonous, and does not read smoothly. This is true for 
both mother-tongue writers and those with English as a foreign language (EFL). But there is a particular 
problem for those with EFL, in that, on the whole, their writings have no ‘voice’. Voice is that essential 
quality of style which embodies the unique personality of the author. It is an elusive element that cannot 
be imposed from above by a copy editor. Unfortunately, most Ph.D. theses written by economics students 
with EFL, though solid pieces of work and competently presented, have a rather bland, depersonalized 
style, and could have been written by the same homo economicus. However, in their favour, they often 
have greater clarity of expression than works by many native English-speaking economists, who are not 
in general noted for the excellence of their style (unlike historians, for instance), nor for their ability 
to communicate, in a lively way, in a language understandable to the public at large. There is even one 
economist, Dierdre McCloskey, who would agree with this criticism. In her Economical Writing (1999), 
addressed specifically to economists, she bemoans their anaemic style, and advises how to remedy this 
deficiency. 
Style is a somewhat nebulous concept that cannot be taught. One can give advice to avoid too many 
short or lengthy sentences, and to vary their structure to ensure that each sentence does not begin 
monotonously with the main clause. These basics are elaborated in Strunk and White’s (2000) compact 
little booklet Elements of Style. But heeding this advice will not necessarily guarantee a ‘good style’. 
Perhaps, however, the magic of style can be absorbed unconsciously by reading, as McCloskey suggests, 
the Classics of English Literature. More relevant are the works of those Anglo-Saxon economists, who 
do have a fine style, without being ‘flowery’ in the literary sense. There is no need to be a Shakespeare to 
write well about economics. And nor does a clear and simple exposition imply a lack of rigour, though 
the excesses of a journalistic style should be avoided.

In his readable Essays in Biography, Maynard Keynes (1933: 190) paid the following compliment to the 
writing of his fellow distinguished economist Alfred Marshall: 
The way in which Marshall’s Principles of Economics is written is more unusual than the casual 
reader will notice. It is elaborately unsensational and underemphatic. Its rhetoric is of the 
simplest and most unadorned order. It flows in a steady, lucid stream, with few passages which 
stop or perplex the intelligent reader, even though he knew but little of economics. 
However, today, Maynard Keynes’s own English style would be regarded as outdated, somewhat mannered, 
and archaic. 
A modern English academic who writes on urban and regional planning, and who has an elegant 
and individual English style, is Professor Sir Peter Hall. A good example is his magnum opus Cities in 
Civilisation (1998), a sustained piece of fine writing over nearly 1000 pages. As a policy maker, the former 
London Mayor Ken Livingstone found this book an inspiration.
One of the academic articles I used for some examples in Chapter 1, ‘Love or Money? The Effects of 
Owner Motivation in the California Wine Industry’, The Journal of Industrial Economics 50 (4): 431–456 
(December 2002), turned out to be quite a find. It manages to provide an analysis of some important 
aspects of business economics in a nutshell, presented in a pleasant and readable style.
As a role model of a Ph.D. thesis written in English by a Dutch Economics student, I would single out 
Marcel Canoy’s (1993) Bertrand meets the fox and the owl. Essays on the theory of pure competition (no. 
48 in the Tinbergen Research Series). Each chapter begins with a dialogue between this fox and owl, 
who discuss in colloquial English a point of economic theory. This sets the scene, and the theme is then 
developed more formally within the body of the chapter. This imaginative work combines mathematical 
analysis with a lively, sometimes witty and playful, fluent English style that would meet with Keynes’s 
approval. Let us eavesdrop as Fox and Owl bicker about game theory (Canoy, 1993: 65, 66):
Fox:	 The problem with yesterday’s game was not the game itself, but the squirrels. […] First 
of all, they couldn’t judge the quality of the nuts. Also our baskets were not directly 
adjacent to each other, so that for at least some squirrels it was a longer route to the 
basket with the lowest price. Moreover, they had to wait in a queue to obtain the lowest 
price. Still, they all went to the lowest price. 
Owl:	 What difference would it make if the experiment was performed with more sophisticated 
animals like owls?

Fox:	 Actually, I was thinking about snails. The difference is that snails would certainly consider 
the distance between their home and the baskets to be an important factor. I can show 
that if the distance between the baskets is sufficient, an equilibrium exists with two 
different prices. 
Owl: 	 So if we play the game, an equilibrium can emerge?
Fox:	 Yes, but my real claim concerns a rather more subtle issue. Suppose that the snails are 
evenly distributed over a given circular area, so that no location is a priori better than 
another. I bet that if the distance between the baskets is sufficient, it is still conceivable 
that I make more profit than you in equilibrium, even if I have the highest price. Naturally, 
you may decide upon locations. 
Owl:	 What do you mean by conceivable? If the Nash equilibrium is unique, the profits are 
simply what they are, assuming we do not play randomised strategies. If no location is 
better than another, demand is evenly spread among the two baskets, so in equilibrium 
both firms have to charge the same price. 
Fox:	 If you think that, it is easy for you to accept the bet. 
Canoy’s writing style would also meet with the approval of Richard Bronk (2009), the author of a recent 
book on the history of economic thought: The Romantic Economist. Imagination in Economics (Cambridge 
University Press). Bronk is not himself an economist, but a classicist and philosopher, who has had a 
career in international finance, where he encountered economics at the ‘coal face’. He considers that 
economics should be written in an accessible style, and in this literate book he practises what he preaches. 
He urges economists to ‘avoid an over-reliance on specialist economic terminology and the dehumanised 
language of mathematics and algebra’ (Bronk, 2009: 17). While, nonetheless, recognizing the value of 
mathematics in economics, Bronk urges economists to continually search for new metaphors, both to 
deepen and refresh their own understanding and to clarify their message to a wider audience of policy 
makers, entrepreneurs and ordinary readers. Quoting the Romantic poet, William Wordsworth, Bronk 
believes that this can be achieved by using the ‘fluid and grounded language “really used by men” ’ (Bronk, 
2009: 18). He also echoes McCloskey’s plea for more oomph in economic writing.
Although style is not as concrete a subject as grammar to impart to authors with EFL, the following 
checklist may help them avoid some of the basic pitfalls in their aim to provide fine writing, for both 
written and oral presentations.

Written texts
1)	 Above all, avoid tortured, overlong sentences. That is, those where, after the main clause, 
a cascade of points relentlessly follow, one after the other without a pause for breath. Such 
sentences are known as ‘loose’. The following single sentence occupies a whole paragraph:
A feature of the reform strongly supported by optimal planners was a switch in the 
formula for forming enterprise wholesale prices from cost (i.e. labour and material 
costs) plus a profit margin expressed as a small percentage of cost plus a profit margin 
expressed as a substantial percentage (usually 15 per cent) of the value of the capital 
employed, a move in line with the suggestions of the optimal planners (and also of those 
economists who advocated the price of production as a general base for price formation), 
but not altogether satisfactory from their point of view (because the allowance for the 
use of capital equipment should take the form of rent charges reflecting the scarcity of 
particular types of means of production rather than an economy wide average rate of 
profit (Michael Ellman, Soviet Planning Today. Proposals for an Optimally Functioning 
Economic System, Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 35). 
This is a perfectly grammatical sentence, but it might have been better to split it in the middle 
to make two sentences: ‘…employed. This was a move in line with…’
Even worse is the long periodic sentence, where after an extensive list of points, the main clause 
comes at last, by which time the reader has ‘lost the plot’. The reader’s brain cannot cope easily 
with such sentences. They may result from the structure of the author’s native language. For 
instance, sentences in Russian can be much longer than their English translations. This point 
is demonstrated by the safety instructions on Russian planes, where the English version, shown 
side by side with the Russian, is much shorter. So, if Russian is the author’s native tongue, this 
wordiness and convoluted sentence formation may be carried into his/her English writing. 
Indeed, in the example of the overlong sentence above, the native English speaking author 
may have been influenced by the sentence structure of his Russian sources.
The following unwieldy sentence (taken from a draft paper by an EFL author) demonstrates 
elements of both the ‘loose’ and the ‘periodic’ sentence:
The ecological city system, the set of public goods, the capacity of city beauty to attract 
activities, the quality of the urban landscape, and the creativity of the inhabitants 
have a role in determining the wealth of a city: in producing a sense of well-being, in 
attracting to the locality people, specialized skills, talent and investments to compete 
more successfully.

Notes on Style
Such a long sentence is too difficult to read comfortably. Again, it could be divided as follows 
(with some changes to improve the flow):
 ‘…inhabitants, all have a role in determining the wealth of a city. They produce a sense 
of well-being…’
2)	 That said, about avoiding long sentences, texts read better if the sentences are varied in type 
and form. While having too many long sentences is taxing for the reader, too many short 
sentences provide an uncomfortable jerky reading experience. It is also important not to start 
every sentence with its main clause but begin with one or, at most, two subordinate clauses. 
(See the previous sentence.)
3)	 Paragraphs should not be too long. A whole page of unrelieved text without a paragraph, or 
even three-quarters of a page, is too much. Moving from paragraph to paragraph, the argument 
should flow smoothly with the help of logical connectors. These words or phrases are placed at 
the start of a paragraph to provide a bridge with the preceding paragraph. Examples are: ‘That 
said,’; ‘In spite of this,’; ‘Nevertheless,’.
4)	 Avoid using long words and pretentious language in the forlorn hope it will look more ‘academic’. 
Pseudo-intellectual phrasing cannot disguise a pitiful lack of meaning. However, this is more 
likely to be a fault of native English speaking authors, as their EFL counterparts usually write 
very clear texts, because they are likely to express themselves more simply in a language which 
is not their mother tongue. Nevertheless, sometimes meaning gets lost in translation, although 
the sentence itself may be perfectly grammatical, as in the following example from an Italian 
author’s English text: 
Big bands go out from the city centre.
This initially perplexed me, but what the author really wanted to say was:
Major arterial roads radiate from the city centre.

5)	 Do not repeat keywords in the same sentence or paragraph as it makes the text monotonous. 
Some languages, e.g. Italian, do not have such a rich vocabulary as English, which has a good 
choice of words with similar meanings. But take care not to chose an inappropriate word when 
presented with an English dictionary with a wide choice of synonyms. For instance, ‘tiny’ or 
‘little’ is not always a substitute for ‘small’: an EFL author may write ‘a tiny town’ when ‘a small 
town’ is correct, though either ‘a tiny village’ or ‘a small village’ is acceptable.
Nevertheless, do not go to extremes in trying to avoid repeating the same word. Sometimes, it 
is not only acceptable, but also necessary, to repeat words. For instance, in detailing the steps 
of a calculation, it would look odd to say in one place ‘add’ and in another ‘put together’ just 
for the sake of variety. However, instead of repeating one word, a universal heading can be 
used at the top of a list. 
e.g. 	
It is necessary to add:
	
	
(1) …
	
	
(2) …
	
	
(3) …
	
	
etc.

6)	 As well as avoiding repetitions of words, do not repeat the same quotation in different parts of 
the text, even in different chapters. As quotations are so distinctive, it makes the reader think: 
‘I’ve seen that somewhere before’.
7)	 If you need to refer back to an earlier section or chapter, do not put ‘as mentioned above/
earlier’ without providing a cross-reference (e.g. see Section 3.1), as otherwise the reader will 
be irritated by having to search back until the section concerned is found.
8)	 Get the rhythm of the sentence right by putting the words in their correct natural order:
	not: Reformulate through constant elasticity of substitution his result. 
	but: Reformulate his result through constant elasticity of substitution.7 
9)	 Avoid spoiling the academic tone of your text with the use of colloquialisms, clichés, and slang 
when writing academic texts. Phrases like ‘At the end of the day’ are outlawed for being too 
hackneyed. Instead, ‘Ultimately’ is short and to the point.
10)	Do not use obscure foreign phrases that are not encountered in English texts. If a foreign 
phrase is not in a reputable English dictionary, like the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 
then do not use it. These days, foreign phrases that are in common use are no longer italicized 
in the dictionary, e.g. a priori, ceteris paribus, ex ante, ex post, inter alia, post hoc, but note 
aide-memoire. 
11)	Do not use archaic words: 
	
archaic	 	
	
meaning
	
happenstance	
	
by chance
	
heretofore	
	
prior to this
12)	Make sure your text contains no ambiguities. These can occur especially with the use of ‘it’, 
and ‘the former’ and ‘the latter’, when it may not be clear exactly what is meant. The following 
example, however, shows exactly how to use this latter pair of expressions:
One important difference between planning by material balances and planning by 
input-out is that the former is concerned with gross production and gross production 
of commodities, and focuses attention on supply bottlenecks, whereas the latter starts 
from final consumption, and focuses attention on the net output available for final 
consumption (Michael Ellman, Soviet Planning Today. Proposals for an Optimally 
Functioning Economic System, Cambridge University Press, 1971: 87).

13)	Do not assume the reader has the same depth of knowledge as yourself, the author, who is 
an expert in the field concerned. Sometimes it is necessary to explain a point more fully, 
even though its meaning might seem obvious to the author. For instance, it is difficult, if not 
impossible, to follow the argument in the following statement, taken from a draft thesis:
‘In particular, Buckles and Hungerman (2010) argue that socioeconomic characteristics 
statistically differ between children born in different months of the year, mainly as a 
result of teenage pregnancies.’
What this interesting but obscure statement actually means had to be explained in the final 
draft with this footnote: 
‘It appears that unwanted pregnancies are often conceived in the summer months, 
which results in more children with a low economic status being born in the winter 
months.’	 
It is also frustrating for the reader if the author asks questions but does not provide the answers. 
Samuelson falls into this trap in his classic economics textbook.
14)	Make free use of analogies, similes, and metaphors to brighten the text. Intriguing names for 
economic models, like ‘Galaxy’ and ‘Urban Facebook’, or for diagrams, like ‘Spider’ or ‘Amoeba’, 
are graphic. Finding imaginative names for theories, e.g. ‘restaurant bill theory’, arouse the 
reader’s interest, and are easy to remember. Barak Obama originated the powerful metaphor 
of “the fiscal cliff”. Even though economists know that the reality of the situation is gradual, 
rather than abrupt decline, this vivid image creates a talking point. In the financial world, 
the phrase ‘dead cat bounce’ is very graphic. Make your own text quotable, just like the texts 
you yourself have chosen to quote. A theme or leitmotif can be a useful tool. Richard Lipsey 
uses this device to good effect in his textbook An Introduction to Positive Economics, where he 
frequently uses the humble Brussels sprout to illustrate points of economic theory in order to 
ground them in reality.
15)	If your thesis is very theoretical, set the scene by relating it to a real-life situation. I recall one 
thesis which used the decline of Easter Island as an introductory chapter prior to a theoretical 
economic analysis. More of these ‘stories’ could add extra depth to a dissertation. 
16)	A nice touch is to start each chapter with a pithy quotation from an expert on the field or from 
works of literature. It puts the reader in context (see the quotation at the start of this Chapter 3).

Notes on Style
17)	Give your text a proper ending. Too often, like a jazz composition, Ph.D. theses end in ‘mid-
air’, on an uncertain note. Perhaps this is realistic, if, after 250 pages of discourse, the issue 
is still not resolved. In general, however, a text should not end in a lame, mediocre way, but 
with a sense that all avenues have been exhaustively explored, and with a memorable phrase. 
18)	When you have finished the first draft of your text, after a suitable interval, take time to read 
it carefully, and you will then probably be able to more easily spot its imperfections that were 
initially not apparent. 
Oral presentation
The following additional points on style refer particularly to the manner of making oral presentations. Of 
course, the papers which are delivered orally need to be based on style principles (1) to (18) listed above, 
but academics with EFL often have to address conferences in English. Moreover, in some countries, e.g. 
the Netherlands and Belgium, Ph.D. students often choose both to write their thesis and to defend it in 
public, in English. This is because some of the members of the Examining Committee on the platform 
may be either native English speakers or do not know the language of the student and have English as 
a second language.

19)	A highly recommended text for students preparing oral presentations is Prof. Max Atkinson’s 
(2004) Lend me Your Ears: all you need to know about public speaking. He gives particularly 
good advice about the use/misuse of PowerPoint as a back-up. Supporting spoken words with 
words on a screen can produce information overload for the audience, who end up without 
being able to take anything in. Moreover, the number of slides is escalating. I have heard of 
presentations using more than 100. In a worst-case scenario, the slide operator may become 
‘out of sync’ with the speaker, and the coordination of speech and screen breaks down.
The worst Ph.D. presentation I have ever witnessed involved an introductory speech delivered 
in broken English at breakneck speed to get everything into a 10-minute ‘window’, against the 
background of long detailed bullet point lists flashing by on a big screen. It was impossible 
to follow either type of presentation simultaneously. The neural networks of the brain were 
scrambled, and no information was conveyed. 
One of the best Ph.D. presentations I have attended concerned a statistical method for evaluating 
nature. It was delivered against a background of projected images of a set of sublime landscapes 
and soft music. That was all that was required to put the audience in a receptive mood to absorb 
the content of the technical speech. 
Atkinson (ibid.) advises that, if it is necessary to use bullet point lists, then keep them short, 
and incorporate blank slides in the sequence so the audience can ‘switch off’ from time to time, 
and concentrate on the spoken words. 
20)	While repetition is not, in general, recommended in written texts, in a speech it can be very 
effective as a rhetorical device used, in modern times, by orators such as Lenin (‘study, study, 
study’) and Tony Blair (‘education, education, education’). When making a series of points, 
three is the ideal number. 
21)	Rhetorical questions can add a touch of drama to a presentation, making the audience ‘sit 
up’. But take care not to pause too long after asking the audience the question, or someone 
in the audience may be inclined to answer it. A true story serves to illustrate this point. The 
Soviet dissident, Andrei Almarik, came to Amsterdam to give a lecture about his difficult life 
in the Soviet Union. He explained how tough it was to be accepted as a student at Moscow 
University, and gave an example of a hard question on an obscure point of Soviet history that 
he had been asked at his failed interview. He appealed to the audience: ‘Who could possibly 
know the answer to that?’ But the question hung just a little too long in the air, and a member 
of the audience, who was not even Russian, ‘helpfully’ supplied the answer – thus ruining the 
speaker’s argument.

Notes on Style
22)	Point (21) above is also an example of another vital ingredient of oral presentation – the use 
of story telling. An appropriate – or, better still, an amusing – anecdote can be a powerful tool 
to give life to a theoretical analysis. To give an illustration: after one defence of a Ph.D. thesis 
on the spatial economics of small rural settlements in the Netherlands, the candidate’s (Dutch) 
supervisor, who made the closing speech in English, managed to give the serious subject of 
rural diversification an immediacy that an account of years of research could not achieve. He 
happened to have been born in one of the villages in the study, and had recently returned to 
visit his aged mother. They took a walk in the surrounding fields and it was apparent that, over 
the decades, the area had changed beyond recognition. The final farmhouse they passed was 
now an establishment called ‘Paradise’. For a moment, the audience were slightly puzzled, and 
then realization dawned, so the occasion ended on a high note with laughter. 
23)	The story in point (22) actually combines two rhetorical devices. As well as narrative, there is 
puzzle-solving, which is a method often employed in the advertising industry, capitalizing on 
an interesting aspect of human behaviour. That is, people are more likely to be attracted to a 
product and buy it if an advert presents them with a word game. The answer is not immediately 
apparent, but when they have eventually solved it, they feel ‘clever’, and, as a result, are favourably 
disposed towards the product. The same applies when a speaker is trying to get a point across. 
24)	However, in the final analysis, whether EFL writers can produce a text with good English style 
may well depend on how well they can write in their own mother tongue. But it is interesting to 
note that, in a BBC Radio 4 discussion of his novel The Boy with the Topknot, the Punjabi author 
Sathnam Sanghera revealed that he could write better in English than in his mother tongue.
25)	When EFL authors or students deliver conference papers in English, to achieve a smooth 
presentation, they should rehearse well to avoid stumbling over words, which may then be 
mispronounced and cause confusion for those listening. As a result, the audience may possibly 
lose the thread of the exposition while they try to understand apparently unknown vocabulary. 
This advice applies equally to native English speakers who can also be incoherent even in their 
mother tongue if they are ‘winging’ it, and have not practised to make perfect. 
Chapters 1, 2 and 3 have dealt with the basics of grammar, style and oral presentation which are relevant 
for authors with EFL when they write academic texts. That might seem all there is to know about this 
skill, but now Chapter 4 provides another useful checklist of final editing points, to which these authors, 
especially students, can refer when making those finishing touches that are essential to the final draft 
and a camera-ready copy of a text.

4	 The Finishing Touches: 22 Basic 
Tips for the Final Editing of Texts 
and Theses − a Checklist
The following advice may seem obvious, but these basic points are often overlooked, and need to be 
corrected in draft articles and dissertations, which holds up completion and submission. 
Spelling
1.	 Check that the spelling of the whole text is consistently all in British English or American 
English throughout. Do not mix the two spellings (see the entry British and American English 
in Chapter 1). However, the original spelling of quotations should be maintained, even if it 
is at variance with the text (see the entry on the use of sic). For words with two acceptable 
spellings, e.g. focused/focussed, benefited/benefitted, choose one and stick to it.
S or Z
2.	 Where words (like organize/organise) can have an s or a z form, decide which you (or the 
publisher) prefer, and use it consistently throughout the text (see the entry S or Z in Chapter 1). 
Again, the original spelling of such words in quotations should be maintained. 
Citations and References
3.	 Check that there is a one-to-one correspondence between text citations and the Reference 
entries. (Any sources consulted, but not used in the text, could be in a separate list called, for 
example, ‘General Reading’, but this is rarely seen.) In addition, there should be consistency 
between citations and References with regard to the spelling of the author’s(s’) name(s) and 
the date of the publication concerned (see the entry Bibliographies in Chapter 1, which has 
a test of your observational skills).
4.	 When a citation occurs as an integral part of a sentence, put the date in brackets after the 
author’s(s’) name(s):
e.g.	
White and Brown (2000) wrote the paper on this topic.
or 	
White and Brown’s (2000) paper on this topic is the seminal contribution.
	
When a citation occurs at the end of a sentence, put it all in brackets:
	
e.g.	
(see, e.g., Smith, 2000).

If there are multiple citations in brackets, separate them off with semi-colons (;):
e.g.	
(see, e.g., Smith, 2000; White, 2002; Young, 2008). 
(Order multiple citations in date or alphabetical order.)
5.	 In citations where a work has more than two authors, put ‘et al.’ (not in italics) after the first 
name (e.g. Smith et al., 1999). Do not forget the full stop (.) after ‘al.’ if using British English; 
there is no full stop after ‘et al’ in American English. 
6.	 Check that the punctuation and layout of each of the References are exactly the same.
Main Contents
7.	 Check that the chapter headings and subheadings in the Contents are exactly the same as they 
are in the body of the text. You cannot trust the computers to do this. 
8.	 On the main Contents page, the words of the chapter headings should not stray into the page 
numbers column. 
9.	 If any chapter, section, table or figure titles in the text contain superscript numbers referring 
to footnotes, or to a table or figure Notes, then these superscripts should NOT appear in the 
main Contents or in the List of Tables and the List of Figures. 
Appendices 
10.	If chapters or sections have Appendices, tie in the numbering of the Appendices, and any tables 
or figures therein, with the number of the chapter or section concerned. 
e.g. 	
An Appendix at the end of Chapter 3 could be called Appendix 3A, and, if it has parts, 
these would be numbered 3A.1, 3A.2, etc. Any tables and figures in this Appendix should 
then be labelled Table 3.A1 (etc.), Figure 3.A1 (etc.).
Tables and Figures 
11.	Include a List of Tables and a List of Figures (in that order) immediately after the main Contents, 
each beginning on a separate page, and check that the titles in these lists are exactly the same 
as in the text.
12.	It is the convention to put table titles above the tables, and figure titles below the figures.

13.	The Sources of tables and figures go below the table and figure Notes. In the case of figures, 
the Notes and Sources are usually placed immediately below the figure title, all beneath the 
figure, i.e.:
Figure 1.1…
Note(s):….
Source(s):…
14.	Figure and table titles do not have a full stop at the end, but Sources and Notes do end with 
a full stop. 
15.	All tables and figures should be referred to in the body of the text.
Equation numbers
16.	Equation numbers should be flush with the right-hand margin. Check to confirm that all 
equation numbers follow consecutively, with no doubling or skipping of numbers.
Use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) for equation numbers, not Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.).

Per cent/percent/%
17.	Use per cent (British English) or percent (American English) as words in the text, not the % 
sign. However, the % sign is used in tables and figures. 
Abbreviations 
18.	If there are a great many abbreviations and acronyms in the text, provide a Glossary explaining 
them in full, placed after the List of Figures. 
Dates 
19.	Write all dates in this fashion: 20 May 2008. It avoids commas and having figures next to 
figures, and is favoured by publishers.
Printing advice
20.	Avoid having small isolated blocks of text of only a line or two above or below tables and 
figures that occupy most of the page.
21.	Use graded weights of print for chapter headings (heaviest), section headings (medium) and 
subheadings (lightest).
22.	Lastly, check that all spacing between letters, words,8 paragraphs and sections is consistent 
in the entire text, and, if the right-hand margin is justified, make sure no pages have uneven 
right-hand margins. Ensure all long dashes are the same length. In particular, where there is 
a pair of dashes, it often happens that one dash is shorter than the other, which is usually a 
computer-generated error. There should be a space on either side of the dashes – like this. In the 
final proofreading make sure no lines have got ‘lost’ in the printing process – sometimes lines 
of text accidentally disappear below tables and figures and at the end of pages, and, where the 
right-hand margin is justified, occasionally short lines crop up. Finally, check page references 
are all present and correct and consistently printed (e.g. Weiss, 2005: 32), that the vertical list 
of page numbers in the main Contents exactly matches the page numbers in the main text, 
and that the titles of chapters and their sections do not stray into the column reserved for the 
page numbers.

Everything You Always Wanted to Know about  
the Definite and the Indefinite Article
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
5	 Everything You Always Wanted 
to Know about the Definite and 
the Indefinite Article (but Were 
too Confused to Know Where to 
Begin)
Introduction
As the use of the definite and indefinite articles (the, a/an) is frequently the most difficult aspect for many 
writers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), this entire section is devoted entirely to its complexities. 
In the main part of this grammar guide, the short entry Definite and Indefinite Articles indicates that 
there is much more to the use of these articles in the English language than the basic rule: ‘particular’ = 
the, and ‘general’ = a/an. Although this is a good rule of thumb, it is too simplistic, especially for students 
with English as a foreign language (EFL students) who have no article in their mother tongue (for 
details, see Section 1 below). Therefore, this section is designed to help EFL students understand the 
many nuances of the definite (the) and the indefinite (a/an) articles when writing texts in English. All 
EFL students have problems with English articles to a greater or lesser extent, even if they are familiar 
with the concept of articles in their own language. The chapter is structured as follows:
Section 1 presents an analysis of the presence or absence of articles in various foreign languages. This 
shows which language groups are likely to have the most problems, and extensive notes explain the 
common and specific problems that are experienced by each language group. In total, 30 difficulties are 
identified and explained. This will provide a few tips for students prior to attempting the first Diagnostic 
Test in Section 2. However, most of the explanatory notes come after this test, whose educative purpose 
is to give the students practice in using the articles and to help them learn from their mistakes.
Section 2 is the actual first Diagnostic Test consisting of an extract from a published spatial economics 
text written by a native speaker of English. All the definite and indefinite articles are blanked out, and 
spaces are left in front of nouns and noun phrases where no article is used, as it is just as important to 
know where not to use articles as it is to know where to use them. The student must then attempt to 
reinsert, or not use, the articles correctly. The difficulty or ease of this exercise will immediately signal 
whether or not the student has a problem with articles and, if so, pinpoint particular or general difficulties. 
Following the test, the full text is provided so that answers can be checked against the original.

Section 3 contains three lists showing when to use:
(1)	
no article at all	 	
	
(22 Rules)
(2)	
the definite article (the)		
(25 Rules)
(3)	
the indefinite article (a/an)	
(19 Rules)
I have called these explanations ‘Rules’, but they might also be described as ‘contexts’, as in:
e.g.	
The sea is usually calm in the Baltic. [Rule 23]
	
The student was all at sea where using articles was concerned. [Rule 1]
Sometimes writers of EFL apply the articles correctly in one context, but then shortly afterwards make 
an error.
The test in Section 2 covered the main bases with respect to the use/non-use of articles, but did not 
cover all 80 Rules in Sections 3 and 4, as it was impossible to find a ‘real’ piece of text which did this. 
Section 3 attempts to fill this gap but does not claim to be an exhaustive list. However, it is a reasonably 
comprehensive account of the use of the articles. Equally important, it explains where non-use is 
appropriate, as EFL students often introduce articles into a text where no article is required.

Section 4 covers 14 special points and constructions involving the use of the and a/an. This brings the 
total number of ‘Rules’ to 80. 
Section 5 is an attempt to include all the 80 ‘Rules’ for the use/non-use of articles within the confines of 
a brief essay. The extract from a book used in Section 2 for the first Diagnostic Test was only a ‘starter’, 
just conveying some frequently occurring examples of article usage. As it proved impractical to find a 
short published text that included all the points discussed in this chapter, I have created my own text 
to serve this purpose. It is on the subject of ‘global warming’, which is a topic that exercises the minds 
of environmental and other economists and is of concern to a growing number of corporations. To my 
knowledge, no other guide has provided such a concentrated checklist. 
The information provided in this chapter is a synthesis of the instructions on the use of articles in the 
following books:
1.	 Practical English Usage. Michael Swan. Oxford University Press, Second edition, 1995.
2.	 Learner English, A teacher’s guide to interference and other problems. Michael Swan & 
Bernard Smith (eds). Cambridge University Press, Second edition, 2001. (Note: This book 
not only helps EFL students to understand the roots of their individual difficulties with 
articles, but also explains why they may experience problems with all other aspects of 
English grammar.)
3.	 The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage. R.W. Burchfield (ed.). Oxford University Press, 
third revised edition, 1996.
4.	 Academic Writing for Graduate Students, A course for nonnative speakers of English. John M. 
Swales & Christine B. Feak. The University of Michigan Press, 2005.(Note: The basic idea 
for the tests in Sections 2 and 5 of this chapter is borrowed from Appendix 1, Tasks 2 and 5 
of this book, which is very useful, but concerns texts on the art of handwriting and medical 
matters. Here, the test texts are more ambitious, based on more relevant economics and 
business texts. Moreover, unlike in Swales & Feak, the answers are provided: the full original 
text follows the tests.)
5.	 Concise Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press, 11th edition, 2004.
6.	 Oxford Business English and Practice, Section 36. Michael Duckworth. Oxford University Press, 
second edition, 2004.
This in-depth treatment of the English articles is worthwhile because, of all the written errors made by 
EFL students, the incorrect use of the articles is perhaps the most important. This involves: the wrong 
or random choice of the, a/an; their unnecessary presence; or incorrect absence. Such mistakes are an 
immediate pointer that a text has been written by a non-native English speaker. These small, but crucial, 
words pervade an English text, occurring in most sentences.

Everything You Always Wanted to Know about  
the Definite and the Indefinite Article
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
In grammatical terms, articles are a subclass of ‘determiners’, which are words that identify things and come 
before nouns (the world, a country) or before qualifying adjectives preceding nouns (the exchange rate, 
an open economy). The other determiner subclasses are possessives (e.g. my, his, our) and demonstratives 
(e.g. this, that, these). In English, articles and possessives are never mixed (e.g. the yours) as is done in 
French, Italian and Spanish.
The most basic rule is that the definite article is used in association with particular things (the law of 
supply and demand) or persons (Marshall, the economist), and the indefinite article with general things 
(a developing country). However, this is by no means the whole story. The English language is never so 
simple, as the notes in Sections 3 and 4 will demonstrate, and sometimes defies explanation. What, for 
instance, is the subtle difference between these two sentences:
	
‘The weather has been wonderful this summer’, and
	
‘This summer we have been having wonderful weather’?
In the first sentence, the definite article is used before ‘weather’ (where it is the subject), and in the 
second sentence no article is used before ‘weather’ (where it is used as an object). Moreover, in the first 
sentence ‘The weather’ would appear to refer to ‘weather’ in general, thus breaking the ‘rule’ that ‘the’ 
is used for particular things. It could, however, be argued that ‘The weather’ means a particular type of 
weather at a particular time of year.
Notwithstanding these complexities, it is not all bad news where English articles are concerned. Indeed, in 
a number of respects the English articles are much easier to use than their counterparts in some foreign 
languages. Both English articles have no genders or cases. The definite article has no plural form, though 
some/any can be used as the plural of a/an. However, the use of this ‘plural’ is often optional, viz.:
Either	 German has some cases.
Or	
German has cases.
Either	 Russian does not have any articles.
Or	
Russian does not have articles.
In contrast, looking at other languages, for both articles French and Spanish have two genders (masculine 
and feminine – respectively: le/la and un/une; and el/la and un/una), and a separate plural (respectively: les; 
and los). Dutch has two definite articles: masculine and neuter – de and het, and one plural: de. German 
really goes to town with three genders for both articles (masculine, feminine and neuter – der, die, das; 
and ein, eine, ein) and a plural (die) for the definite article, all of which have four cases (nominative, 
accusative, genitive, dative). This is not the sum total of the versatility of the German articles, as there 
is yet a separate negative indefinite article (kein), which also has three genders and four cases. Compare 
all this with the mere two unisex and undeclinable English articles.

The difficulty with the English articles lies not in their form but in their myriad uses. Therefore, first, 
Section 1 of this chapter will begin to unpack these uses by revealing the relative ability of EFL students 
to cope with the English articles, according to their mother tongue. Of course, not only between but 
also within each language group there will be a range of ability from those who have an innate ‘feel’ for 
the English language to those who are struggling to achieve fluency.

Analysis of presence or absence of the  
definite articles in various foreign languages
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
Section 1: Analysis of presence or 
absence of the definite 
articles in various foreign 
languages
The extent to which EFL students with various mother tongues may have difficulties with using English 
articles is explained below in subsections A, B, C, D and E (in order of increasing difficulty) (based on 
information about language groups provided in Source 2 on p. 120, with my own examples).
A.	
Languages (apart from English) that have both articles: definite and indefinite
Dutch
French
German
Greek
Italian
Portuguese
Scandinavian languages
Spanish and Catalonian
Difficulties experienced by native speakers of Group A
Common problems
1.	 The definite article is used where it should be omitted in general statements, i.e. before 
plural nouns
Wrong:	
	
The interest rates are rising.
Correct:	
	
Interest rates are rising.
Wrong:	
	
The money was not used in primitive societies.
Correct:	
	
Money was not used in primitive societies.
2.	 The definite article is often used incorrectly before certain nouns
society
nature 	
[when it means ‘countryside’; but when it means ‘character’, the definite article 
may be used, e.g. the nature of the problem]
planning
space
training

Analysis of presence or absence of the  
definite articles in various foreign languages
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
e.g.	
	
‘There is no such thing as society’ [not: as the society] [quote of former British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Womans Own, 31 October 1987].
	
	
An integrated part of the Rotterdam harbour development programme is a plan 
for nature [not: for the nature].
	
	
Planning is essential for creating a sound economy [not: The planning].
	
	
The exploration of space [not: of the space] is not economically viable.
	
	
Job centres now offer training to the unemployed [not: the training].
3.	 Indefinite article omitted where it is necessary
Wrong:	
	
He is economist.
Correct:	
	
He is an economist.
Wrong:	
	
On that farm there are hundred (thousand) hectares of poor land.
Correct:	
	
On that farm there are a hundred (thousand) hectares of poor land.
4.	 Indefinite article used where it should be omitted
Wrong:	
	
On that farm there are a 100 (a 1000) hectares of poor land.
Correct:	
	
On that farm there are 100 (1000) hectares of poor land.
Note the difference between the examples of Errors 3 and 4 where, in the former, the number 
‘a hundred (a thousand)’ is written in words, while in the latter the number ‘100 (1000)’ is 
written in figures and does not require the use of the article a.
Specific problems for certain EFL students 
5.	 Definite article used incorrectly before most place names (i.e. by Greeks and Italians)
Wrong:	
	
the Chicago; the France (cf. the French la France)
Correct:	
	
Chicago, France
There are a few exceptions: The Hague (note the capital T in The), the Netherlands, the 
Maldives, the Philippines, the UK, the United States, the Yemeni Republic. Note, however, that 
‘the Ukraine’ used to be correct but now, in conformity with the general rule, it is ‘Ukraine’, 
without the definite article.
6.	 Definite article used incorrectly before proper names (e.g. by Greeks and Italians)
Wrong:	
The President Chirac criticized the George Bush’s decision to invade Iraq.
Correct:	
President Chirac criticized George Bush’s decision to invade Iraq.

Wrong:	
the America’s economy; America’s the economy
Correct:	
America’s economy
(This does not apply before ordinary genitive nouns, e.g. the country’s economy – There, it is 
correct to use the definite article.)
9.	 Nouns that are always plural in English used incorrectly in the singular with (mainly) 
the definite article (e.g. by the French)
Wrong:	
The British no longer sell the arm to Indonesia (should be: sell arms).

14.	No distinction made between the indefinite article and the written number ‘one’ (e.g. by 
the Spanish)
Wrong:	
One plan is necessary to run the economy efficiently [should be: A plan…].
15.	Confusion about when to use few/little or a few/a little (by Italians)
few/little have a negative connotation:
e.g.	
Saudi Arabia has few sources of fresh drinking water.
	
Saudi Arabia has little fresh drinking water.
a few/a little have a more positive connotation:
e.g.	
There are only a few people without a car these days.
	
There is still a little money in your bank account.
Note: ‘a good few’ means ‘many’ – the opposite of ‘few’.

B. 	
A language with a definite article but no indefinite article
Arabic
Speakers of this language share the problems of Group A (see Errors 1–16 above), but also have particular 
problems of their own. Although there is a definite article, it is not freestanding but is attached in front 
of the noun as a prefix (al-), and is not used in the same ways as in English.
17.	Use of definite article in Arabic where it is not used in English
The lecture is the Wednesday 
[should be: is on Wednesday].
In Canada, they grow the wheat 
[should be: they grow wheat].
18.	Problems with the English article arising from the Arabic genitive construction
In Arabic there is no equivalent of genitive nouns, either with an apostrophe (’s, s’) at the end 
or with of the/of a in front. So literal translations from the Arabic might look like this:
Literal English		
	
Idiomatic (normal) English
paper Samuelson	
	
the paper of Samuelson (or: Samuelson’s paper)
wage worker	 	
	
the wage of a worker (or: a worker’s wage)
economy the country	 	
the economy of the country (or: the country’s economy)
state economy the country	
the state of the country’s economy
Most problems with the use of articles by Arabic speakers stem from the absence of the 
indefinite article in Arabic.
19.	Indefinite article wrongly omitted with singular countable nouns
Wrong:	
This is book about English grammar.
Correct:	
This is a book about English grammar.
20.	The indefinite article is used in places where the English definite article is not used (i.e. 
before uncountable and plural nouns)
Wrong:	
A wheat is grown in Canada.
Correct:	
Wheat is grown in Canada.
Wrong:	
These are a books from the library.
Correct:	
These are books from the library.

Analysis of presence or absence of the

English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
C. 	
A language with no definite article but a separate indefinite article
Turkish
Again, there are the usual problems with the article (Errors 1–16 above), especially because there is no 
definite article.
21.	Incorrect use of definite article before direct objects
Although Turkish has no definite article, the form of definite direct objects is different from 
that of indefinite direct objects. This means that Turkish speakers have a tendency to put the 
in front of all direct objects, even though it may not always be correct to do this in English.
e.g.	
Mayor Boris Johnson runs the London [should be: runs London].
	
The its economy is booming [should be: Its economy is booming].
The errors in these examples may look the same as Errors 5 and 7 in Section A above, but the 
cause is different.
The indefinite article exists as a separate entity in Turkish but it is placed between an adjective 
and the noun. In this respect, the error is the same as Error 13 in Section A above (i.e. sharp 
a fall instead of, the correct, a sharp fall).

Analysis of presence or absence of the

22.	Incorrect use of some instead of a/an
Wrong:	
The industrialist prepared some business plan for some bank that loaned him 
some money.
Correct:	
The industrialist prepared a business plan for a bank that loaned him some 
money.
The difficulty here arises because in Turkish the distinction between countable nouns (i.e. 
business plan and bank) and uncountable nouns (i.e. money) is not so clear as it is in English. 
It is therefore difficult to decide whether to use a/an (before countable nouns) or some (before 
uncountable nouns). The choice is more often for some, but this does not work with countable 
nouns, as is evident in the example above.
D. 	
A language with no separate definite or indefinite articles but with suffixes added to 
nouns to indicate whether they have a definite or indefinite sense

Notes on Style
Note 1. With respect to Errors 1–30, where reference is made (in brackets) to a certain language or 
languages, this only means that speakers of those languages are more prone to make these errors, not 
that the error concerned is not made by native speakers of other languages in Groups A–E.
Note 2. In Section 1 the material about the articles has been organized in terms of the errors that EFL 
students are likely to make. After the first Diagnostic Test in Section 2, Sections 3 and 4 then provide a 
more systematic explanation of how to use the English articles. Inevitably, there will be a certain amount 
of repetition of Section 1 points in Sections 3 and 4, but this will help the learning process. Moreover, 
new examples are used and extra ‘Rules’ are included to fill any gaps in the Section 1 list. The final 
Diagnostic Test in Section 5 gathers together everything in this long Chapter 5.

Section 2: The first Diagnostic Test
Section 2: The first Diagnostic Test
In the following Diagnostic Test, a spatial economics text written by a native English speaker is used to 
practise using the articles. In this text, all the definite and indefinite articles in front of every noun or 
noun phrase have been extracted and replaced by blank spaces marked thus: ___. Blank spaces are also 
inserted before nouns and noun phrases (e.g. ___ economic planning) that do not need articles, as EFL 
students often add unnecessary articles. The student has to decide what article, if any, to insert in the 
blank spaces. There are three choices:
1)	 The, the (the definite article)
2)	 	A/An, a/an (the indefinite article)
3)	 	No article, i.e. neither the definite nor the indefinite article (in this case, leave the space blank).
Example of a test sentence:
___ GNP of ___ country is not ___ indicator of ___ happiness.
Example with blanks filled in, or left blank (no article required):
The GNP of a country is not an indicator of ___ happiness.
If a test sentence starts with a blank space, and no article is required, change the first letter of the noun 
or noun phrase into a capital letter (unless it is a ‘proper noun’ that already starts with a capital letter, 
e.g. Adam Smith, France).
Test:	
	
___ investment is necessary. ___ manufacturing industry must grow.
Answer:	
___ Investment is necessary. ___ Manufacturing industry must grow.
Test:	
	
___ WTO rulings are sometimes controversial.
Answer:	
___ WTO rulings are sometimes controversial.
When you have worked through the test, you can compare your answers with the original text, a copy 
of which follows the test. This will help you to see what, if any, aspects concerning the use of articles 
are causing problems for you. Within the text, some of the uses are repeated, as is normal in any piece 
of writing. This will give you extra practice. Indeed, it is only by repetition that the elusive, instinctive 
use of the articles can be acquired.

Section 2: The first Diagnostic Test
The test text only includes the main constructions that use articles (or do not use them, as the case 
may be). Ideally, a test text should cover every single point discussed in this chapter, but, in practice, it 
is unlikely that a short extract of a real text would do this.10 Those constructions that do not appear in 
this particular block of text can be found (together with all those that are used in the practice text) in 
the list of uses in Section 3, supplemented by special points in Section 4. 
The test: Fill in the blanks with the definite or the indefinite article, or leave blank if no article is 
required. If no article is required at the beginning of a sentence, then the first letter of the first word 
of that sentence must be changed to a capital letter. In the text below, where this choice has to be 
made, the first letter of this word is placed in square brackets.
The following text with the articles removed is extracted from P. Ellman, The Socio-Geographic Enquiry, 
in: Royal Commission on Local Government in England, RESEARCH STUDIES 1 by the Greater London 
Group, the London School of Economics and Political Science, London, HMSO, 1968, pp. 415–416.

Section 2: The first Diagnostic Test

There is one deficiency in the commuting data: it relates to units which are often large and 
heterogeneous in character. The data is presented in the form of a matrix of flows between 
administrative areas (**Metropolitan, County and Municipal Boroughs; **Urban and Rural 
Districts). This leads to particular difficulties in interpretation in rural areas, since one big rural 
area may be orientated towards as many as four different towns, with no possibility of saying which 
parts of the area are most strongly orientated towards which towns. Dunmow Rural District, in 
Essex, is a good example of this problem. In such a case, it was generally necessary to fit the entire 
rural district into the hinterland of that centre to which it sent the most commuters, though it 
would have been more realistic to draw the hinterland boundaries within the rural district itself. 
This would be possible only if **commuting statistics, and hence **workplace statistics, were coded 
and presented by the Census on *a basis of wards and civil parishes. But this limitation is a minor 
one when set against the general richness and comprehensive character of the commuting data.
0.7	
Therefore, our primary basis for the delimitation of city regions is *a study of commuting patterns 
and of **changes in those patterns over time. It is then supplemented by a study of shopping 
patterns for durable goods, which is based on the development of a general model of these patterns 
based on the Kent observations, and on the application of this model to the rest of the South 
East Planning Region. Section 1 of the report presents the analysis of commuting and describes 
the concept of the Standard Metropolitan Labour Area, which is the basic geographical unit of 
analysis of this data. Section 2 describes how the concept of the Standard Metropolitan Labour 
Area was extended and transmuted into the concept of the District, which is the geographical 
unit recommended in our main report as the basis for local government reform in the South 
East region. Section 3 presents the results of the analysis of durable goods shopping, and relates 
this to the concepts of the Standard Metropolitan Labour Area and District. And lastly Section 4 
supplements the shopping analysis by a study of the provision of retail shops and other central 
services in the towns of the region, with the primary purpose of identifying the most important 
centres of urban activity as *a basis for local government reform.

Section 3: The most widely-used 
constructions using the 
definite and indefinite 
articles
Section 1 concentrated on the difficulties with articles experienced by each language group. Section 3 
now reinforces the lessons learnt in the Section 2 test, by providing a more comprehensive checklist of 
the situations where articles are used in English, and indicates the type of article appropriate for each 
situation. First, however, it is instructive to draw attention to those instances where no article is required 
before the noun or noun phrase (but is often found in texts written by EFL students). The numbered 
Rules 1–80 correspond to the superscripts (with hyperlinks to Section 3) used in Section 5 (Format 3) 
to indicate their occurrence in the test essay on global warming.

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
3.A 	
When to use no article (technically known as the ‘zero article’)
1)	 No article is used when the noun (often in the plural form) or noun phrase has a general 
meaning:
	
e.g.	
Bachelor’s degrees take three years [not: The Bachelor’s degrees].
	
		
Dutch farmers grow potatoes [not: The Dutch farmers…the potatoes].
	
		
It is cost-effective to transport high volume goods by air, and low volume goods by sea.
Compare with 3.B.23, where the definite article is used for nouns or noun phrases with a 
particular meaning.
2.	 No article is used with abstract nouns:
	
e.g.	
Life is difficult in the slums of Bombay [not: The life…].
	
		
Change is in the air in Turkmenistan [not: The change…].
3.	 Uncountable nouns generally do not take articles:
	
e.g.	
Unemployment is rising [not: The unemployment…].
	
		
Money is needed for the tsunami victims [not: The money…].
	
		
Water is scarce in the Sahara [not: The water…].
	
		
Oil is now €52 per barrel [not: The oil…].
	
		
Energy can be generated from the wind [not: The energy…].
	
		
Carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing in the atmosphere [not: The carbon…]. 
	
However, when used in a particular sense, uncountable nouns can take the definite article:
	
e.g.	
The water in that river is stagnant [i.e. this particular stretch of water].
	
And in a few cases the indefinite article:
	
  e.g.	
Omega-3 is an essential oil.
	
Merino sheep have a fine wool.
	
But note in both examples the interposition of an adjective between the article and the noun.
	
	The following italicized uncountable nouns are often preceded incorrectly by 
	
	the definite article in texts by writers of EFL: 
	
		
Society will no longer tolerate the avaricious behaviour of bankers. 
	
		
Some recent studies have attempted to evaluate Nature. 
	
		
Training is essential to bring the long-term unemployed into work. 
	
		
Planning is the answer to the problem of global warming.
	
		
Colonizing space will ensure the future of planet Earth.

4.	 No article is used where countable nouns in foreign languages are uncountable in English:
e.g.	
Financial advisers give advice to homebuyers [not: the advice, or an advice].
	 		
Estate agents provide information about houses for sale (not: the information).
5.	 Certain uncountable nouns sometimes need no article at all; and sometimes need the definite 
article; and, more rarely, the indefinite article:
       	
e.g.	
rain, snow, weather, global warming [no article]
	
Rain:	 Both rain and drought can ruin crops [no article].
	
		
In November 2000, the rain was so heavy in Britain that much of the country was under 
floodwater [definite article].
	
		
A light rain was falling when the protesters started the anti-war march [indefinite article].
	
Snow:	In winter, the roads are often blocked by snow [no article].
	
		
The snow in February brought the railways to a halt [definite article].
	
Weather: The importance of weather cannot be ignored as a determinant of prices on the oil 
futures market [no article].
	
	
   Bad weather has ruined the Russian grain harvest on a number of occasions [no article].
The Russian grain harvests are susceptible to the vagaries of the weather [definite article].

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
(Incidentally, this last sentence is an example of the use of the in a general sense, against the ‘rule’ – see 
3.B.23 below.)
6.	 No article is used before calendar months:
	
	 e.g. 	
Tax returns are filed in April in the UK. 
7.	 No article is used before a particular theory (e.g. trade theory, Arrow’s theory, general 
equilibrium theory):
	
e.g.	
John von Neumann invented game theory.
8.	 No article is used in commonly-paired structures:
	
e.g.	
guns and butter (not: the guns and the butter)
	
		
supply and demand (not: the supply and the demand)
9.	 The article is dropped after genitive nouns constructed with apostrophes (’s or s’):
	
e.g.	
Ricardo’s work (not: the Ricardo’s work, or Ricardo’s the work)
10.	The definite article is dropped before expressions indicating amount and number:
	
	e.g.	
100 years
	
		
60 C
	
		
80 per cent
	
		
an amount of money [not: of the money]
	
		
a number of people [not: of the people]
11.	The definite article can often be dropped after both and all:
	
	e.g.	
Both countries are underdeveloped (not: Both the countries).
	
		
All economists agree that interest rates are a powerful instrument (not: All the 
economists).
12.	The indefinite article is missed out after the expressions kind of, sort of, type of, variety of (in 
formal writing):
	
	e.g.	
The Rover is an outdated type of car [not: type of a car].
13.	In general, no article is used before place names (e.g. cities/countries), certain institutions, 
buildings, and companies:
	
	e.g.	
Vancouver is a booming city [not: The Vancouver].
	
		
Britain is not in the Eurozone [not: The Britain].
	
		
Lake Baikal is the world’s deepest lake.

However, there are a few exceptions:
	
e.g.	
The Hague, the United Kingdom
	
And, unlike lakes, rivers take the definite article:
	
e.g.	
the Thames.
	
Also note the alternative to names like Cambridge University – the University of Cambridge.
	
Another interesting exception to the ‘Rule’ that the is not generally used before place names 
is:
	
e.g.	
 The Moscow of the Soviet era is not the Moscow of today.
	
This, in fact, conforms to the main rule for using the definite article when referring to particular 
known things (see 3.B.23 below).
14.	No article is used when ‘Man’ and ‘Woman’ are used in general:
	
e.g.	
Man was a hunter-gatherer in prehistoric times.
	
		
‘Man’s love is of his life a thing apart, ’Tis woman’s whole existence’ (Lord Byron, Childe 
Harold’s Pilgrimage, 1812–1818).
15.	No article is used before job titles:
	
e.g. 	
Head of Department; Chairman of the Board of Directors
	
No article is used before people’s names, or names preceded by a title:
	
e.g.	
Boris Johnson is the current Mayor of London (not: The Boris Johnson).
	
		
President Bush is the President of the United States (not: The President Bush).
	
		
Mrs Thatcher was the first woman to be a British Prime Minister (not: The Mrs Thatcher). 
Later she was elevated to the peerage and became Lady Thatcher (not: the Lady Thatcher). 
Lord Desai is a British economist who currently sits in the House of Lords (not: The 
Lord Desai…).
	
But: 	 The Lord Chancellor presides over the House of Lords.
	 		
Here the article is used before ‘Lord’ because no specific name is mentioned.
	
Also note:	
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon.
	
		
	
The Dalai Lama.
16.	Often there are no articles before names of NGOs: 
	
e.g. 	
Greenpeace, Oxfam, Worldwatch Institute. 
	
e.g. 	
‘This involved the production of a report by Greenpeace Netherlands detailing the types 
of E & S [Environmental & Social] problems associated with the palm oil industry in 
Indonesia and the nature of Dutch banks’ involvement with various plantation companies 
operating there between 1994 and 1999.’

(Niamh A. O’Sullivan, Social Accountability and the Finance Sector: The Case of Equator Principles 
(EP) Institutionalisation, Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2010, p. 110).
(See also Rule 30 for the use of the before organisations’ names.)
17.	No articles are used before short headings and titles in books and papers, as in this side-
heading:
e.g.	
Most widely-used constructions using the definite and indefinite articles (not, as is usual 
in writing: The most widely-used constructions…).
	
Nor are articles used when referring to specific chapters, etc.:
	
e.g.	
Please turn to Chapter (Table, Figure) 1 (not: the Chapter 1, etc.).
18.	The definite article is not used with certain abbreviations that, if written in full, would need 
the article:
	
e.g.	
At one time, President Yeltsin expressed the wish for Russia to join NATO.
as opposed to:
	
		
At one time, President Yeltsin expressed the wish for Russia to join the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization.

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
19.	The definite article is dropped before next and last when these words are not preceded by in 
the:
	
e.g.	
Next month, the balance of payments figures should improve.
	
		
Last month, unemployment rose by 1%.
	
(See 3.B.43, where the is used before next and last.)
20.	The definite article is omitted when a noun with a particular meaning is converted into an 
adjective with what Swan (1995) calls a ‘half-general’ sense.
	
This process can best be explained by the following examples using:
1)	 	the noun phrase the nineteenth century, and
2)	 	the adjective derived from this, nineteenth-century
	
e.g.	
(1) Though Ricardo and Walras are economists of the nineteenth century, they are still 
influential today.
	
		
(2) The works of nineteenth-century economists continue to be studied in twenty-first-
century universities.
	
In (2), nineteenth-century is ‘half-general’ because it does not describe all economists but only 
those writing in the nineteenth century (the same applies to twenty-first century universities), 
so the definite article is omitted.
	
However, the indefinite article is not omitted before such an adjective, as in:
	
Ricardo is a nineteenth-century economist.
This refers to a general class (see 3.C.50).
21.	The indefinite article is dropped before a nationality when the adjective derived from the 
proper noun is used:
	
e.g.	
He is a Russian (an American) [proper noun with indefinite article].
	
		
He is Russian (American) [adjective with no indefinite article].
	
In this case, the related adjective is the same as the proper noun, which is the usual situation, 
but in some cases it is not:
	
e.g.	
She is a Dane/Swede/Dutchwoman/ Briton/Turk/Pole/Frenchwoman 
	
		
[all proper nouns].
	
		
She is Danish/Swedish/Dutch/British/Turkish/Polish/French  
[all adjectives].

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
22.	As a general rule, the articles are not used before an adjective or an adverb on their own:
	
e.g.	
It is difficult (not: It is a difficult).
	
But, in the English language there is always a ‘however’. (In this last sentence, note the unusual 
use of the indefinite article before the adverb however). So see 3.A.21 above and 4.80 for 
exceptions to this ‘Rule’.
This completes the list of situations where it is not appropriate to use any article. Now let us turn to 
a discussion of the circumstances in which the definite (Section 3.B) and the indefinite (Section 3.C) 
articles are used.
3.B	
When to use the definite article
23.	Use the definite article when referring to particular known things, persons, organizations, 
institutions or major events:
	
e.g.	
The financial advisor you recommended gave poor advice.
	
		
I went to the professor for a reading list. 
	
		
The IMF’s statements are taken very seriously by national governments. 
	
		
The Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century. 
	
		
The Bachelor’s degree course at the University of Amsterdam takes three years.
	
		
The Kyoto Protocol
	
		
The Maastricht Treaty
	
Compare the last whole sentence above, referring to a particular degree, with Section 3.A.1 
above, where no article is required if the noun or noun phrase has a general meaning, when 
referring to Bachelor’s degrees in general. Likewise, in the final Key Reference Essay and Test 
in Part 5 of this chapter, you will see at one point: ‘the adaptation to climate change’, and later 
on ‘In the case of adaptation’.
	
Reminder:
1. When referring to the various works written on a certain subject call this ‘the literature’ or 
‘the marketing literature’ (for instance). Often ‘the’ is incorrectly omitted by authors with EFL.
	
2. Except as a heading, do not write ‘results’, without the definite article:
	
e.g.	
Incorrect:	
‘Results of the study suggest that managers act more opportunistically 
while trading in their options than in their shares’ (David Veenman, 
Insider Trading. The Interrelation between Accounting Information, 
Stock Prices, and Reported Insider Trades, Ph.D. Thesis, University of 
Amsterdam (2010), p. 164).
	
		
Correct: ‘The results of the study…’

24.	 Use the definite article when referring to an entire class in general:
	
	e.g.	
The computer has made it much easier to conduct a barrage of statistical tests.
	
		
The dollar is up today.
	
		
Kahn invented the multiplier.
	
(See Section 3.C.50 below, where the indefinite article is used when referring to a member of 
a class.)
25.	Use the definite article when referring to the physical environment:
	
	e.g.	
 the sea, the mountains, the climate, the weather, the North
	
	(See 3.A.5 above.)
26.	Use the definite article when referring to physical features:
	
	e.g.	
the Rocky Mountains, the North Atlantic, the River Seine, the Grand Canyon
27.	Use the definite article sometimes when referring to landmark buildings:
	
	e.g.	
the London Stock Exchange, the London Eye
	
		
the Swiss Re building, the Chrysler building
	
		
the Bank of England, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank
	
		
the Statue of Liberty
	
	(See also 3.A.13).
28.	Use the definite article when referring to nationalities in general:
	
	e.g.	
the Russians, the Australians
	
	(See III.C.64 below for nationalities in particular.)
29.	Use the definite article when referring to a social group:
	
	e.g.	
the poor (rich):
	
		
A government should take tax from the rich to distribute the revenue to the poor.
30.	Use the definite article when referring to many political groups: 
	
	e.g. 	 the Greens, the Conservative Party. the LibDems, the Reds, the Monster Raving Loony 
Party
	
	but note: 
	
	e.g.	
the Labour Party is often simply referred to as ‘Labour’ with no definite article; likewise, 
the United Kingdom Independence Party is commonly called ‘UKIP’; and see also 3.A.16 
for NGOs with no preceding article.

31.	Use the definite article with certain place names:
	
	e.g.	
The Hague, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, the Baltic States, the 
World
	
	(The definite article is not used with place names within countries – see 3.A.13 above.)
32.	Use the definite article in the expressions ‘the rest’, ‘the same’, ‘the only’:
	
	e.g.	
The rest of the sample is not representative.
	
		
GNP is not the same as GDP.
	
		
The UK and Denmark are not the only EU countries that are not in the 
	
		
Eurozone.
33.	Use the before the adjective ‘well-known’:
	
	e.g.	
The well-known economist Maynard Keynes was a Professor at Cambridge University 
in the thirties.
	
	(See also 3.B.54 below.)
34.	Use the in italics in place of the expression the most well-known:
	
	e.g.	
Is it the Bjørn Lomborg who is lecturing on climate change in the Faculty today?

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
35.	Use the in italics (or underlined) for emphasis in general:
	
	e.g.	
The existence of a laboratory for economic experiments is the
	
		
(or: the) indicator of an up-to-date Economics Department.
36.	Use the definite article in the expression ‘in the case of’.
	
	This is one of the most common omissions of the by EFL students.
	
	In the case of (meaning ‘concerning a particular instance’) is quite distinct from in case of 
(meaning ‘in the event of’, or ‘if there is a possibility of’), or in case (meaning ‘if there is’):
	
	e.g.	
Concerning EU regional employment in the last decade, in the case of the UK 
unemployment went down, but in the case of Germany it went up.
	
		
In case of a recession, measures will be taken to help the unemployed.
	
		
In case a Member State does not meet its targets under the EU’s Stability and 	
	
	
		
Growth Pact, heavy fines will be imposed.
37.	Another common expression which incorrectly loses the definite article in texts written by 
EFL authors is ‘on the one hand…on the other hand’.
	
	A similar expression is ‘the one…the other’.
38.	Use the definite article in the expression the…of (even if the meaning is general):
	
	This is one of the most common expressions using the in the English language, as is demonstrated 
in the test texts in Sections 2 and 5 of this chapter:
	
	e.g.	
‘…the most important centres of urban activity…’
	
	For more details, see the entry The…of in the List of Common Errors in Chapter 1 of this 
grammar guide.
39.	The definite article is sometimes used in American English when it is not used in British 
English:
	
	American English:	
	
He is at the university [meaning: he is studying at a university].
	
	British English:	
	
He is at university [meaning the same as the previous example].
	
	In both British and American English, ‘He is at the university’ also means ‘He can be 	
found today at a particular university’, as opposed to being somewhere else (e.g. at home).
	
	In American English, ‘He is at the University of London’, the definite article indicates that he 
is studying at a specific university.
40.	The definite article is used with certain abbreviations:
	
	e.g.	
the WTO, the IMF, the EU, the UN, the FTSE
	
	(See 3.A.15 for cases where no article is used.)

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
41.	The definite article is repeated to make two different items clearly distinct, e.g. when referring 
to two colours:
	
e.g.	
the black and the blue cars [two cars of different colours]
	
		
the black and blue car [one car painted in two different colours]
42.	In certain cases, the use of one the can suffice for two separate groups:
	
	e.g.	
the rich and poor inhabitants
43.	The definite article must be used with next and last in certain phrases:
	
	e.g.	
In the last century, production rose [not ‘in last century’].
	
	A frequent mistake by non-native English speakers is to omit the in such phrases. ‘In the last 
century/year/decade/month/week’ is a phrase used when speaking from the vantage of the 
present, looking back in time. The same applies to ‘In the next century, etc.’, looking forward 
to a future trend. ‘Last month/week, etc.’ and ‘Next month, week, etc.’ refer more to short-term 
results and expectations and omit the article.
The same rule also refers to expressions like ‘the coming decade’, ‘the early years’, or ‘the present 
day’.

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
44.	Similarly, when referring to dates, use the definite article: 
	
	e.g.	
The 1980s/the 21st century/the 1st of May 
45.	The definite article is used for ‘second mention’:
	
	e.g.	
They have a government grant to build a factory [first mention].
	
		
The factory [second mention] will provide employment for 2000 workers.
46.	The definite article is used before statistical tests and names of indexes:
	
	e.g.	
the T-test, the Chi square test, the Moran’s I statistic, the Dow Jones index, the 
Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI)
47.	The definite article is sometimes an integral part of the official title of a newspaper or 
journal, and has a capital ‘T’:
	
	e.g.	
The Times, The Independent, The Economist
	
	But note Financial Times (usually referred to as the Financial Time: here the has a small ‘t’).
3.C 	
When to use the indefinite article
General instruction:
	
a/an is used with singular nouns or noun phrases:
	
e.g.	
a discussion, an analysis [but see exception in 4.75 below]
	
		
a heated discussion, an in-depth analysis 
	
Sometimes EFL students write ‘an analyses’, combining the singular article with a plural noun, 
but probably meaning ‘an analysis’. 
	
(See the entry *analyse in Confusion between words in the Alphabetical List of Common 
Errors in Chapter 1 of this guide.)
48.	a is used before nouns or noun phrases beginning with a consonant (a dollar, a WTO ruling, 
a national strategy) or with a voiced vowel (a university, a UN resolution, a once-and-for-all 
payment, a hotel (pronounced with a voiced ‘h’ – see 4.72).
49.	an is used before nouns and noun phrases beginning with an unvoiced vowel (an economist, 
an umbrella, an IMF decision, an hotel – with the ‘h’ silent: an -otel (archaic) – see 4.72).
50.	a/an is used when referring to a member of a general class:
	
	e.g.	
He is an industrial economist [i.e. one member of a general class].

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
51.	The indefinite article is used before expressions of quantity:
	
	e.g.	
There were a number of recessions in the 20th century.
	
		
a hundred, a thousand, a million
	
	This rule does not apply if these numbers are written in figures or as percentages, when no 
article is used (see also 3.A.10):
	
	e.g.	
It costs 1000 euros.
	
		
It costs 1 million euros [note the combination of a number and a word – one would not 
write ‘It costs 1,000,000 euros’].
	
		
Today, 80 per cent of the world’s population lives in urban areas.
	
	However, if the number concerned is used as an adjective, then the indefinite article is used, 
whether or not the number is written in figures or numbers:
	
	e.g.	
a two-step method [Here ‘two’ is an adjective.]
	
		
a 10-dollar bill [Here ‘10’ is an adjective.]
	
	The indefinite article is also used if a number is used after an adjective:
	
	e.g.	
an extra six votes, an extra 50 dollars
	
		
a fake 20-euro note
	
	(Note: numbers 1–10 are usually written in words and numbers 11 onwards in figures, or part 
figure, part word (2 million). The number 10 is transitional – it can be either a word or a figure. 
But the Cambridge University Press Style Guide instructs the use of words for numbers 1–100. 
Figures are used for units of currency, however large or small (1 pound, 30 pounds), and in 
percentages (30 per cent).
52.	The indefinite article is used before singular nouns that come after a negative statement:
	
	e.g.	
Under the Stability Pact, EU countries should not have a budget deficit [not: have budget 
deficit].
53.	The indefinite article is used after a preposition that comes before singular nouns and noun 
phrases:
	
	e.g.	
The bank manager asked the entrepreneur to come to his office with a business plan.
	
		
Without a doubt, sea levels are rising.
	
		
GNP can be used as an indicator of a country’s prosperity.
54.	The indefinite article is used with fractions:
	
	e.g.	
a quarter-pound steak, a half turn 
	
	But:	 half a pound of tomatoes

55.	The indefinite article is used to indicate a part of a whole (using of a, or of the):
	
	e.g.	
three-quarters of an hour
	
	 But:  ¾ hour 	
	
	Here of a is not used after the fraction when it is written as a figure.
	
	e.g.	
 six of the best
	
	e.g.	
Now that the car factory has to close down, a considerable proportion of the workforce 
will be made redundant.
	
		
A higher percentage of the respondents were female.
	
	Note: When the definite article is used before such words of proportion, the definite article 
after of is omitted:
	
	e.g.	
In recent years, the percentage of workers employed in manufacturing industry has 
declined [not: ‘the percentage of the workers’].
56.	The indefinite article is used with countable nouns:
	
	As in the case of the definite article, countable nouns can be preceded by the indefinite article 
(a tonne, a car).

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
57.	The indefinite article can sometimes be used with uncountable nouns:
	
	In general, abstract and uncountable nouns cannot be used with the indefinite article (i.e. it is 
incorrect to say, for instance, a wool, an advice, an information), but when uncountable nouns 
refer to aspects of thought or feelings, then the indefinite article is used, but often an adjective 
is interposed between the article and the noun.
	
	e.g.	
A deep knowledge of economic theory is essential before forecasting can be attempted.
	
		
It is a universal truth that the equilibrium price is determined by the interaction of 
supply and demand.
	
		
A sadness came over him when he thought of the poor.
58.	The indefinite article can be used in a particular sense.
	
	Just as the definite article can be used atypically in a general sense (see 3.B.24 above), so too 
can the indefinite article be used atypically in a particular sense.
	
	e.g.	
It has been a difficult week [referring to a particular week] for the world stock markets.
59.	The indefinite article is used after ‘quite’, ‘rather’, ‘such’, ‘many’ and ‘what’:
	
	e.g.	
Quite a few students drop out of university.
	
		
Rather a lot of waste is generated in modern countries.
	
		
Such an enormous amount of investment is needed to host the Olympic Games.
	
		
Many a business plan has come to grief.
	
		
What an expensive house they have bought.
60.	The position of the indefinite article can change the meaning:
	
	e.g.	
The local Council was not in a position to make a big investment [meaning a big 
investment in general].
	
		
The local Council could not make that big an investment [meaning an investment of a 
particular size].
61.	The indefinite article is used in comparisons:
	
	e.g.	
He is not as good a lecturer as his predecessor.
	
		
The Matterhorn is not as high a mountain as Mount Everest.
	
	In these examples note the inversion of the adjective and the indefinite article (‘good a’, ‘high 
a’) compared with the usual order with the adjective placed after the indefinite article (a high 
mountain − see A.13 in Section 1 of this chapter).

The most widely-used constructions  
using the definite and indefinite articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
	
	In the more common form of the comparison, after ‘as’, ‘as… as’, or ‘like’, the usual rules for not 
using/using the definite and indefinite articles apply as in 3.A, B, and (the rest of this section) 
C:
	
	e.g.	
High speed trading is as fast as lightning (3.A.5).
	
		
The stock market is as unpredictable as the weather (3.B.23).
	
		
Phillips devised a hydraulic contraption to show that the economy could be 
	
		
treated like a machine (3.C.48).
62.	The indefinite article is used with the expressions ‘a few’, and ‘a little’, according to the nature 
of the noun concerned.
	
	Use ‘a few’ with countable nouns:
	
	e.g. 	 a few countries
	
	Use ‘a little’ with uncountable nouns: 	
	
	e.g. 	 a little coal
	
	(See A.15 in Part I of this chapter)
63.	The indefinite article can be used to mean ‘per’:
	
	e.g.	
He earns €2000 a week.
64.	The indefinite article is used before nationalities:
	
	e.g.	
an American, a Swede, a Spaniard, an Australian
	
	(but see 3.A.21, which deals with circumstances where the article is dropped: 
	
	e.g. 	 He is American. She is Swedish.)
	
	The use of the indefinite article before nationalities is similar to its use before members of a 
general class (see 3.C.50 above):
	
	e.g. 	 He is an economist.
65.	The indefinite article is used in front of a name, if the person concerned is not very familiar: 
	
	e.g.	
A Professor Smith rang this afternoon, but no one knows who he is. 
66.	Note that some/any are the plural forms of a/an:
	
	e.g.	
He needs a book from the library today [singular: a book].
	
	
He needs some books from the library today [plural: some books].
	
	The latter sentence is positive in meaning, so the form some is used. If the meaning is negative, 
then any is used:
	
		
He doesn’t need any books from the library today [plural: any books].

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Section 4: Final remarks on the 
use of the and a/an (not 
always as articles)
For completeness, the following examples show further interesting constructions following on from 
Rule 66 in Section 3.C using the and a/an, and illustrate queries that often arise. Rules 67–71 relate to 
the; Rules 72–78 to a/an; and Rules 79 and 80 concern both the and a/an. In some of these Rules: 67, 
69, 77, 78, and part of 79, the and a/an are not used as articles, per se, but may be mistaken for articles.
67.	The used in comparative constructions:
	
	e.g.	
According to happiness research, the older people get, the happier they are.
	
		
The faster the Chinese economy grows, the greater the danger of a hard landing.
	
	In these examples, the is used not as an article but ‘adverbially…to indicate how one amount 
or degree of something varies in relation to another’ (COED, 2004).

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
	
	The can also be used adverbially with the comparative (more, better, less):
	
	e.g.	
Global warming means that it is all the more important to reduce carbon emissions, 
none the better than by reducing car ownership. Nonetheless, car ownership is rising. 
However, because of improved technology in car design, this does not necessarily mean 
that there will be any the more carbon emissions.
68.	The used in superlative constructions:
	
	e.g.	
China has the fastest growing economy in the world.
	
		
This textbook is the best I have ever read.
	
		
Some people do not think global warming is the most important change we face today.
	
		
It is of the utmost importance to read all the books and articles on the reading list.
	
	(Note: EFL students often omit the in the expression ‘of the utmost importance’.) 
69.	The can be used in place of enough:
	
	e.g.	
The government does not have the money [i.e. enough money] to build an Olympic 
Stadium.
70.	The expression ‘What is the matter’:
	
	This is a common expression meaning ‘What is wrong?’
	
	e.g.	
What is the matter with the Russian economy?
71.	The people and people have completely different connotations:
	
	e.g. 	 ‘Government of the people, by the people, for the people’ (Abraham Lincoln). 
	
	Here, ‘the people’ means ‘the collective mass of people’ in a country.
	
	e.g.	
People say that the rich pay too little tax.
	
	Here ‘people’ refers to some people. 
72.	The vexed question of whether to use a or an before words like ‘hotel’ and ‘historical’:
	
	Official opinions are divided. According to the 11th edition of the COED (2004):
	
		
‘It is better to use “a” rather than “an” before words such as “hotel” and “historical” that 
begin with a sounded “h”. “An” was common in the 18th and 19th centuries because the 
initial “h” was then often not pronounced.’
	
	The revised Third edition of The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage (ed. R.W. Burchfield, 
1990: 2) both agrees and disagrees with the COED about whether to choose a or an.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
	
	In informal speech:
	
		
‘(…) the thoroughly modern thing to do is to use a (never an) in a habitual, a heroic, a 
historical, a hypothesis (…) an hotel is now old-fashioned (…) but by no means extinct.’
	
	However:
	
		
‘At the present time, especially in written English there is abundant evidence for the use 
of “an” before habitual, historian, historic(al), horrific, but the choice of form remains 
open’ [my italics – PE].
	
	Of these two sources, the COED is the more up-to-date, so follow that in your own writing, 
i.e. use a, but do not be surprised to see an in written work especially by authors of an older 
generation.
	
	Avoid at all costs a new American development in informal speech: a apple.
73.	An optional aspect concerning the placing of a:
	
	Sometimes, the position of a changes in expressions involving the constructions a too or to…a/
an, but this has no effect on the meaning:
	
	e.g.	
either	 	
a too strict regime
	
		
or	
	
too strict a regime 
	
		
either	 	
a too detailed analysis
	
		
or	
	
too detailed an analysis
	
	In fact, both these formulations are correct.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
74.	Usually, the indefinite article comes before an adjective:
	
	e.g.	
a strong economy
	
	But sometimes (as in Spanish) the indefinite article can be used in English as an adjective that 
describes a noun:
	
	e.g.	
Germany does not have as successful an economy as the UK.
	
	Also note the difference between:
	
		
that big investment
	
		
that big an investment
	
	Here the use of the indefinite article after the adjective transforms the statement from the 
particular to the general.
75.	Surprisingly, the indefinite article can be used with the plural:
	
	e.g.	
an estimated €200,000
	
		
an extra £5000
	
		
a $700 billion bail-out
	
		
a further three
	
		
a good few [which means ‘many’!]	
	
	Note: a hundred years, 100 years; a million pounds, £1,000,000.
76.	Also take care with the use of the indefinite article before percentages: 
	
	e.g.	
When Tony Blair was the British Prime Minister, he aimed for a 60 per cent reduction 
in carbon emissions. The succeeding British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was more 
ambitious, aiming for an 80 per cent reduction. 
	
	Note:	 a 60 per cent increase
	
		
a $700 increase 
	
		
an 80 per cent increase
	
	In the first two cases, 60 per cent and $700, when voiced (said out loud), begin with a consonant 
(i.e. sixty, seven hundred), so the a form of the indefinite article is used. In the third case, 80 
per cent, when voiced, begins with a vowel (i.e. eighty) so the an form of the indefinite article 
is used. 
For completeness, in this final collection of ‘oddities’, the following examples are special constructions 
involving the use of a but not as an article.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
77.	e.g.	
A-hunting we will go (Traditional English folk song)
	
		
A frog he would a-wooing go (Traditional English folk song)
	
		
The times they are a-changing (1960s song by Bob Dylan)
	
	This is a rather archaic construction, dating back to at least Elizabethan times, where the use 
of a as a prefix adds what Burchfield calls ‘whimsicality’. It still crops up in everyday speech 
(e.g. ‘go a-begging’). Only recently, an article in the Wall Street Journal (20 January 2014:32) 
began: ‘Shell’s new broom is a-sweeping’ (Helen Thomas, Shell needs a sea change). This usage 
could have been imported by the Pilgrim Fathers from England.
78.	There is also the case where a is used as a prefix of privation or negation, to mean ‘not’:
	
	e.g.	
amoral, asocial, asymmetrical, atypical
79.	Increasingly, in rapid informal speech, a is being used as a suffix, either as an indefinite 
article stuck on to the end of words or to replace ‘of’, ‘have’, and ‘to’, telescoping two words 
into one:
	
	e.g.	
loadsamoney [loads of money]
	
		
coulda, mighta, woulda, shoulda [could have, etc.]
	
		
gonna, wanna, oughta [going to, want to, ought to]
	
		
gotta lotta [got a lot of]
	
		
whata lotta [what a lot of]
	
Language purists like The Queen’s English Society deplore such corruption of the language, 
but the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, sometimes resorted to this kind of language 
when addressing certain groups (e.g. the young MTV audience or members of a trade union), 
recognizing it as a way to communicate with ‘the masses’. Moreover, he abandoned his refined 
‘Oxford accent’ on these occasions and adopted the infamous ‘glottal stop’ of ‘Estuary English’ 
(widespread in the counties around the Thames Estuary). This means that the ‘t’ in ‘got a’ and 
‘lot a’ is not pronounced so the words sound like ‘go-a’, ‘lo-a’. In England, there is a Northern 
version of ‘gotta lotta’, which is ‘gorra lorra’, found particularly in the Liverpool area (Beatles 
country). The current Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer has been known to be populist 
in this way.
	
Even academics like Kate Burridge, Professor of Linguistics at Monash University in Australia, 
in her book Weeds in the Garden of Words: further observations on the Tangled History of the 
English Language, 2005, regards ‘gonna’ as a word that is likely to be perfectly acceptable at some 
future time. And Professor Jean Aitchison, Emeritus Professor of Language and Communication 
at Oxford, agrees.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Finally:
80)	 An atypical example of the use of the and a/an with a lone adjective:
	
	Normally, the definite and indefinite articles are not seen in the company of free-standing 
adjectives (see 3.A.22 above), but there are a few instances where this can happen in formal 
academic writing, as well as in informal speech.
	
	e.g.	
In Figure 1, the green line shows the trend of agricultural employment from 1990–2000, 
the red the trend for manufacturing employment, and the blue the trend for service 
industry employment.
	
	Of course, here the noun ‘line’ is understood after the adjectives ‘red’ and ‘blue’.
	
	Another example like this is:
	
		
‘Would you like a red or a green apple?’ ‘I’ll have a green.’
	
	Again, the noun ‘apple’ is understood after ‘red’ and also after ‘green’, though there the ‘missing’ 
noun could be ‘one’ (a green one).
	
	There are two famous novel titles that have articles with lone adjectives:
	
		
‘The Red and the Black’ (Stendal)
	
		
‘The Red and the Green’ (Iris Murdoch)

	However, let us close the discussion of this anomaly with an example from economics of the 
indefinite article used with an adjective and no noun:
	
	e.g.	
Refined oil is a good. Environmental pollution caused by oil refining is a bad.
	
	In the COED, the word ‘good’ is primarily an adjective (6 meanings), and secondarily a noun 
(2 meanings):
	
	‘1 that which is morally right; righteousness. 2 benefit or advantage.’
	
	The first of these two meanings has nothing to do with ‘a good’ in the economic sense, and the 
second does not completely capture the essence of the economic ‘good’, which is something 
that has positive marginal utility. The word ‘bad’, on the other hand, is only an adjective in 
the COED. So, it would appear that economists have, for their own purposes, transformed the 
adjectives ‘good’ and ‘bad’ into two unofficial nouns ‘a good’ and ‘a bad’.
Section 5 will now illustrate all the examples of article usage in Sections 3 and 4 above, by means of a 
short essay on the subject of global warming. Some common usages will occur more than once, as is usual 
in ‘real’ texts not designed as ‘tests’. For instance, Rules 1, 23, 38, 48, 49 occur many times, reflecting the 
basic, particular/general dichotomy of article usage discussed in Chapter 1.

Section 5: Reference essay: A key to 
the application of the 80 
Rules for using/not using 
the articles
The final part of this extensive Chapter 5 is a short essay. Within this compact framework, writers with 
EFL will be able to see, at a glance, how or whether to use articles in the most common situations. To 
serve different purposes, the one essay is presented in different formats: 
Format 1 is the key text in the form of a test (like the first short Diagnostic Test in Section 2), where 
all the articles are deleted and replaced by (underlined) blank spaces. Readers can see how much of the 
information they have absorbed from this Chapter 5 by attempting to fill in the blanks. After completing 
the test, readers can refer to Format 2 to check their answers. 
Format 2 is the full text of the essay with all the examples of article usage/non-usage. Readers can use 
this essay as a template, where they can locate the answers to all their queries about using articles.

Reference essay: A key to the application  
of the 80 Rules for using/not using the articles
English Grammar For  
Economics And Business
Format 3 is, again, the complete essay, but this time with the addition of superscripts 1–80 (with hyperlinks 
to Sections 3 and 4 of this chapter), indicating which of the 80 Rules (as listed in those sections) have 
been applied in the essay. In the course of the text, there are a number of examples of the same rule, 
as it was impractical to produce a short essay using just one example of each rule. Moreover, in reality, 
some constructions which involve the use of articles will inevitably occur more frequently than others. 
This was demonstrated earlier in the less complex test in Section 2 of this chapter, which covered a more 
limited range of article usage. 
Caveat: Rules 77, 78 and 79 are not incorporated in the test essay. These are ‘curiosities’, included in this 
guide for completeness. Rule 77 concerns the archaic ‘pseudo-article’ in words like ‘a-hunting’, where a 
means ‘in the process of doing something’. This use of a as a prefix also occurs in more modern words 
like ‘afloat’. Rule 78 refers to words like ‘atypical’, where sometimes EFL writers incorrectly treat the a 
part of the word like the indefinite article and write ‘a typical’. But it is in fact a prefix, meaning ‘not’. 
While in Rule 78 the a may be erroneously divorced from the whole word, as a false article, in Rule 79 
the a is a real article which has become attached to the previous word as a suffix (e.g. wotta = what a). 
Rule 79 refers to the ubiquity of a in rapid, informal, corrupted English speech, e.g. whata lotta, worra 
lorra, wo-a-lo-a (all meaning ‘what a lot of’). This is slang use of a, with the latter expression including 
the uncultured ‘glottal stop’. Nevertheless, although the essay concerns the serious subject of global 
warming, its general tone is light, so I have showcased the usage of Rule 79 in the sub-title of the basic 
essay. Although this usage is certainly not, as the main title of this book says, English Grammar for 
Economics and Business, you may encounter it at oral presentations, as young people from all strata of 
British society may speak this ‘Estuary English’ dialect these days.
The topic of global warming is not just the terrain of climatologists, but has repercussions from both 
an economics and a business perspective. Firms are now beginning to adopt the concept of Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR), which aims to safeguard the environment from the effects of their activities.
The Key test essay which now follows contains sentences that use the articles in most conceivable contexts.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Key to article usage (1)
Format 1 – 	
Text with blank spaces to be filled in or not filled in according to the Rules for the use/
non-use of the definite and indefinite articles. (Of the 80 Rules, Rules 77, 78 and 79 are 
used but not tested, as these are, respectively, archaic, a false article, and slang. They do, 
however, make an appearance in the full text Format 2, and, are flagged, like the other 
Rules, in Format 3.).
[Note: 	 If no article is required at the beginning of a sentence, then the first letter of the first word of 
that sentence must be changed to a capital letter (unless it is a proper noun which already begins 
with a capital letter). In the text below, where this latter choice has to be made, the first letter of 
this word is placed in square brackets.] 
__ [d]ilemma of __ Global Warming 
Wotta Lotta (or Worra Lorra) Water (or Wa-a)
Only as recently as __ 1980s, __ climatologists were predicting that __ World was heading towards 
another Ice Age. But now in __ 21st century, __ latest apocalyptic vision for __ future of __ Planet comes 
in __ form of __ global warming (GW) threat. According to __ Guardian Weekly (17 May, 2013), __ 
International Energy Association (IEA) has forecast that there will ultimately be __ estimated 6°C of __ 
GW, ‘__ level that would lead to __ chaos’. However, __ most recent IEA report (June __ 2013) actually 
anticipates 3.6–5.3°C of __GW over the __ coming century. All these estimates might seem too high __ 
figure, given that only __ 0.76°C increase in __ warming has been recorded over __ last two centuries. 
__ GW, of whatever degree, is associated with __ increasing amounts of __ carbon dioxide (CO2) in __ 
atmosphere. Indeed, in __ May 2013, there was __ first indication that __ CO2 concentration had reached 
__ critical tipping point of __ 400 parts per million (ibid.). This figure is, however, based on __ samples 
taken for half __ century at __ single, somewhat atypical, location – __ Hawaiian volcano. Whether this 
increase of __ CO2 is due to __ works of __ Humankind since __ Industrial Revolution of __ 18th century, 
or to __ natural causes, or to __ combination of both, is hotly debated. Some __ people would deny __ 
existence of __ GW altogether. What is required is __ in-depth knowledge of all __ influencing factors.
Nevertheless, there is already compelling __ evidence of __ GW. If __climate were not changing there 
would not be such __ massive reduction of __ Polar ice, with __ corresponding increase of 19 cm in __ 
global sea level since 1900. __ [c]onsiderable proportion of __ ice cap has already melted. __ [g]laciers 
of both __ Arctic and __ Antarctic are melting at __ exponential rate. Quantifying __ melt can be used 
as __ indicator of __ GW. Indeed, __ melting ice is considered to be __ indicator of __ climate change. 
Last year (2012) was __ record period of __ ice loss. __ [i]cebergs, some weighing __ megaton, are 
breaking off __ glaciers when they reach __ sea. When __ polar bears go a-hunting for __ food they 
may be stranded on __ ice floe.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
However, while, on __ one hand, __ Greenland glaciers, which discharge into __ North Atlantic, are 
melting, on __ other, in __ Eastern Arctic, __ ice is reported to be getting thicker. So it is __ difficult 
to be certain about __ average trend. At __ beginning of __ long cold winter of January to late __ May 
2013, __ well-known London Mayor __ Boris Johnson, in __ article in __ Daily Telegraph (21 January 
2013), wrote: ‘It really feels like __ start of a __ mini-ice age.’ But, __ few days later, __ Professor Haigh, 
__ Head of __ Physics at __ Imperial College London, refuted this, saying, amongst other things, that 
__ Boris was confusing __ short-term variability of __ weather with __ long-term trend of __ climate 
(ibid., __ ‘Letters’ page, 23 January 2013). Even so, in __ June 2013 __ Meteorological Office (MO) in 
__ UK announced that, over __ last decade, __ global temperatures had remained stable. Yet, __ MO 
still refuses to conclude that __ GW trend has halted for good. And, meanwhile, __ CO2 levels continue 
to rise, though __ rate of __ increase is slowing down.
Notwithstanding this, __ kind of consensus has arisen that __ GW is really happening. Only __ few 
scientists do not believe in __ climate change. Both __ climatologists and physicists agree that __ facts 
on __ ground and in __ air point to __ GW. Their mouthpiece is __ IPCC (__ Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change). For many years, __ Americans refused to acknowledge __ reality of __ GW. (__ 
President George W. Bush was __ climate change denier.) But, now, even they cannot ignore its existence. 
__[p]lanning for __ climate change can be delayed no longer. Some __ governments, like that of __ UK, 
want to see __ 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050. Like __ MO, __ IPCC regards __ 15-year 
‘pause’ in __ GW as __ mere blip in its inexorable progress.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
But, it is not all __ doom and __ gloom, as demonstrated by both __ pluses and __ minuses of __ climate 
change. Some __ regions will benefit, while others will be disadvantaged, but there is not any part of __ 
globe that will not be affected, both __ well-endowed and __ less well-endowed regions. The __ [m]ore __ 
ice melts, and __ volume decreases, __ quicker __ remaining ice will melt. As __ considerable proportion 
of __ Polar ice has already disappeared, __Verkhoyansk may no longer be __ Cold Pole, and there is 
__ high chance that over __ next 20 years __ Arctic waters will be ice-free. This will open up __ North 
West Passage and revolutionize __ economies of those countries bordering __ Arctic. 
__ concept of change not only applies to __ climate but also to __ development of __ primary sector. 
Some __ geologists have discovered that __ Greenland has __ vast reserves of __ mineral resources 
under its currently impenetrable ice cap, but for __ future there is __ plan to exploit them. __ [p]lan will 
be realized if __ GW continues. Across the Arctic regions, __ Russians, __ Canadians and __ Chinese 
are competing for __ rich reserves. Moreover, __ land in __ Northern Russia, __ Greenland and __ 
Northern Canada could become available for __ agriculture. Further South, __ single-cropped areas 
could become double-cropped. In more temperate zones, __ English farmers, for example, could grow 
__ Mediterranean fruits, and __ supply channels will be disrupted less often as there will be less __ snow 
and __ ice. However, __ climate change will bring, and indeed some say is already bringing, __ increase 
in __ extreme weather. __ [s]ummers will become too hot, __ winters too cold. __ [f]loods will alternate 
with __ droughts in __ same area. In __ most alarmist scenario, during __ freak flood, __ sea level is 
predicted to rise as high as __ top of __ Statue of Liberty or __ Nelson’s Column. 
While __ governments are becoming convinced about __ climate change, __ social surveys show that 
__ public scepticism is growing. __ [p]eople are not convinced. Nevertheless, __ enormous amount of 
__ information about __ GW is gradually building up. There has been __ great number of __ academic 
books and __ papers on __ subject, which provide __ deeper knowledge of __ GW mechanism. __ 
[c]limate theory is __ new and expanding field, which has been developed by __ 20th and 21st century 
scientists. In __ recent decades, __ computer has made it easier to run __ models which can attempt to 
forecast __ climate change. Even so, __ Professor of Climatology at __ Climate Research Institute of __ 
University of East Anglia had to defend his research staff when __ email came to light that admitted to 
using __ ‘statistical trick’ to demonstrate __ GW trend. This was, in fact, __ acceptable scientific method.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
__ Figure 1 below illustrates how __ raw statistics might be misleading, and especially so depending on 
how they are presented. __ [f]igure is __ historical analysis of __ occurrence of __ long-distance outdoor 
Dutch ice-skating race, __ ‘Elfstedentocht’ (__ 11 towns route) which dates from 1909. It can only be held 
in those years when __ winter ice is thick enough. Sometimes it occurs in two consecutive years but it 
has never occurred more than once __ year. __ [f]igure clearly shows that there were considerably more 
Elfstedentochts (11) in __ first 50 years after 1909 than in __ next 50 years right up to __ present day 
(4), which might ‘prove’ __ existence of __ GW. However, as __ race became increasingly popular over 
__ century, __ explanation for __ decrease in __ number of races may be that it became necessary for 
__ canal ice to be much thicker than it was in __ early years, to bear __ weight of __ extra competitors.

Figure 1: __ [n]umber of Elfstedentochts (__ natural canal-ice races) per decade in __ Netherlands since 1909 (__ 1st 
Elfstedentocht) 
Note: So far, up to late 2013, in __ decade beginning 2009 there have been no Elfstedentochts, as was also __ case for __ previous decade 
1999–2008, because of __ mild winters. Even __ prolonged winter weather of early 2013, which lasted till __ end of __ May was not cold 
enough. Perhaps __ cold winter of early 2013 just reflected __ ‘pause’ in GW. 
Although most __ climate research seems to prove __ existence of __ GW, there is no general agreement 
on its cause, although, on __ 30 May 2013, __ Daily Telegraph (DT) reported that ‘one recent survey of 
12,000 academic papers agreed that __ human activists were causing __ planet to warm’. However, __ 
next day, this interpretation of __ figures was corrected on __ ‘Letters’ page (DT, 31 May 2013): 
	
‘It is not true that 97 per cent of academic papers __ supported the __ Anthropogenic Global 
Warming (AGW) theory. Around __ 37 per cent of papers endorsed __ AGW while __ 60 per 
cent stated no position for or against AGW.’
 __ [r]est of the papers, __ 3 per cent, reject __ idea of __ AGW, or even GW as __ whole concept. 
__ [h]ypothesis put forward by both __ AGW and GW deniers is that, over __ course of __ geological 
time, __ Earth has undergone __ natural cycle of __ warming and cooling. Indeed, it is true that __ 
‘several million years ago… __ Arctic was ice-free, savannah spread across __ desert and __ sea level was 
up to __ 40 metres higher than today’ (__ Guardian Weekly, 17 May 2013). Recently, __ fossil evidence 
of __ camels has been found in __ frozen Arctic wastes. However, this kind of __ refutation of __ GW as 
__ recent phenomenon, does not always hold when we recall that, __ 200 million years ago, __ current 
Northern countries, like __ UK and __ Sweden, were situated South of __ Equator, where __ tropical 
climate might be expected, so it is not surprising that their geological strata record __ different climate 
from today, now they have migrated with __ continental drift to __ Northern climes.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Nevertheless, whatever __ cause of __ GW, it is of __ utmost importance for __ future of __ Planet to 
take some practical steps to mitigate __ GW effects. __ Bjørn Lomborg is __ statistician, who is perhaps 
__ climate change sceptic because of his book __ Skeptical Environmentalist (Lomborg 1998). In fact, he 
is not __ climate change denier, and does believe that: 
	
‘__ [g]lobal warming, though its size and future projections are unrealistically pessimistic, is 
almost certainly taking place’ (ibid., __ Part 1, __ Chapter 1: 4). 
But he also believes that: 
	
‘__ [g]lobal warming is not anywhere near __ most important problem facing __’ 
	
[ __ Lomborg’s own italics] (ibid., __ Part V, __ Chapter 24: 243). 
Moreover, he is convinced that __ correct response to __ GW is not __ prevention of, but __ adaptation 
to, __ climate change, which is __ less costly option by far. When his book was denounced by __ Danish 
Committee for __ Scientific Dishonesty, he wrote to __ Wall Street Journal (‘Why are __ Greens afraid 
of me?’, 23 January 2003): 
	
‘I am __ Danish… __ former member of __ Greenpeace; and I used to believe in __ litany of 
our ever-deteriorating environment…this litany doesn’t seem to be backed up by __ facts…This 
is most obvious in __ discussion over __ global warming… __ economic analyses show that it 
will be far more expensive to cut __ carbon dioxide emissions radically than to pay __ costs of 
__ adaption to __ increased temperatures.’

The Dilemma of Global Warming 
Wotta Lotta (or Worra Lorra) Water (or Wa-a)
Only as recently as the 1980s, climatologists were predicting that the World was heading towards another 
Ice Age. But now in the 21st century, the latest apocalyptic vision for the future of the Planet comes in 
the form of the global warming (GW) threat. According to The Guardian Weekly (17 May, 2013), The 
International Energy Association (IEA) has forecast that there will ultimately be an estimated 6°C of GW, 
‘a level that would lead to chaos’. However, the most recent IEA report (June 2013) actually anticipates 
3.6–5.3°C of GW over the coming century. All these estimates might seem too high a figure, given that 
only a 0.76°C increase in warming has been recorded over the last two centuries. 
GW, of whatever degree, is associated with increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. 
Indeed, in May 2013, there was the first indication that CO2 concentration had reached the critical tipping 
point of 400 parts per million (ibid.). This figure is, however, based on samples taken for half a century 
at a single, somewhat atypical, location – a Hawaiian volcano. Whether this increase of CO2 is due to 
the works of Humankind since the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, or to natural causes, or to 
a combination of both, is hotly debated. Some people would deny the existence of GW altogether. What 
is required is an in-depth knowledge of all the influencing factors. 
Nevertheless, there is already compelling evidence of GW. If the climate were not changing there would 
not be such a massive reduction of Polar ice*, with a corresponding increase of 19 cm in global sea level 
since 1900. A considerable proportion of the ice cap has already melted. The glaciers of both the Arctic 
and the Antarctic are melting at an exponential rate. Quantifying the melt can be used as an indicator 
of GW. Indeed, the melting ice is considered to be the indicator of climate change. Last year (2012) 
there was a record amount of ice loss. Icebergs, some weighing a megaton, are breaking off the glaciers 
when they reach the sea. When polar bears go a-hunting for food they may be stranded on an ice floe.

However, while, on the one hand, the Greenland glaciers, which discharge into the North Atlantic, are 
melting, on the other, in the Eastern Arctic, the ice is reported to be getting thicker. So it is difficult 
to be certain about the average trend. At the beginning of the long cold winter of January to late May 
2013, the well-known London Mayor Boris Johnson, in an article in The Daily Telegraph (21 January 
2013), wrote: ‘It really feels like the start of a mini-ice age.’ But, a few days later, a Professor Haigh, 
Head of Physics at Imperial College London, refuted this, saying, amongst other things, that Boris was 
confusing the short-term variability of weather with the long-term trend of climate (ibid., the ‘Letters’ 
page, 23 January 2013). Even so, in June 2013 the Meteorological Office (MO) in the UK announced 
that, over the last decade, global temperatures had remained stable. Yet, the MO still refuses to conclude 
that the GW trend has halted for good. And, meanwhile, CO2 levels continue to rise, though the rate of 
increase is slowing down.
Notwithstanding this, a kind of consensus has arisen that GW is really happening. Only a few scientists 
do not believe in climate change. Both climatologists and physicists agree that the facts on the ground 
and in the air point to GW. Their mouthpiece is the IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change). For many years, the Americans refused to acknowledge the reality of GW. (President George 
W. Bush was a climate change denier.) But, now, even they cannot ignore its existence. Planning for 
climate change can be delayed no longer. Some governments, like that of the UK, want to see an 80 per 
cent reduction in emissions by 2050. Like the MO, the IPCC regards the 15-year ‘pause’ in GW to be a 
mere blip in the inexorable progress of GW.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
But, it is not all doom and gloom, as demonstrated by both the pluses and the minuses of climate change. 
Some regions will benefit, while others will be disadvantaged, but there is not any part of the globe that 
will not be affected, both the well-endowed and the less well-endowed regions. The more the ice melts, 
and the volume decreases, the quicker the remaining ice will melt. As a considerable proportion of the 
Polar ice has already disappeared, Verkhoyansk may no longer be the Cold Pole, and there is a high 
chance that over the next 20 years the Arctic waters will be ice-free. This will open up the North West 
Passage and revolutionize the economies of those countries bordering the Arctic. 
The concept of change not only applies to climate15* but also to the development of the primary sector. 
Some geologists have discovered that Greenland has vast reserves of mineral resources under its currently 
impenetrable ice cap, but for the future there is a plan to exploit them. The plan will be realized if GW 
continues. Across the Arctic regions, the Russians, the Canadians and the Chinese are competing for 
the rich reserves. Moreover, land in Northern Russia, Greenland and Northern Canada could become 
available for agriculture. Further South, single-cropped areas could become double-cropped. In more 
temperate zones, English farmers, for example, could grow Mediterranean fruits, and supply channels will 
be disrupted less often as there will be less snow and ice. However, climate change will bring, and indeed 
some say is already bringing, an increase in extreme weather. Summers will become too hot, winters 
too cold. Floods will alternate with droughts in the same area. In the most alarmist scenario, during a 
freak flood, sea level is predicted to rise as high as the top of the Statue of Liberty or Nelson’s Column. 
While governments are becoming convinced about climate change, social surveys show that public 
scepticism is growing. The people are not convinced. Nevertheless, an enormous amount of information 
about GW is gradually building up. There has been a great number of academic books and papers on 
the subject, which provide a deeper knowledge of the GW mechanism. Climate theory is a new and 
expanding field, which has been developed by 20th and 21st century scientists. In recent decades, the 
computer has made it easier to run models which can attempt to forecast climate change. Even so, a 
Professor of Climatology at the University of East Anglia had to defend his research staff when an email 
came to light that admitted to using a ‘statistical trick’ to demonstrate the GW trend. This was, in fact, 
an acceptable scientific method. 
Figure 1 below illustrates how raw statistics might be misleading, and especially so depending on how 
they are presented. The figure is a historical analysis of the occurrence of a long-distance outdoor Dutch 
ice-skating race, the ‘Elfstedentocht’ (the 11 towns route) which dates from 1909. It can only be held in 
those years when the winter ice is thick enough. Sometimes it occurs in two consecutive years, but it 
has never occurred more than once a year. The figure clearly shows that there were considerably more 
Elfstedentochts (11) in the first 50 years after 1909 than in the next 50 years right up to the present day 
(4), which might ‘prove’ the existence of GW. However, as the race became increasingly popular over the 
century, the explanation for the decrease in the number of races may be that it became necessary for the 
canal ice to be much thicker than it was in the early years, to bear the weight of the extra competitors.

Figure 1: Number of Elfstedentochts (natural canal-ice races) per decade in the Netherlands since 1909 (the1st Elfstedentocht) 
Note: So far, up to late 2013, in the decade beginning 2009 there have been no Elfstedentochts, as was also the case for the previous decade 
1999–2008, because of the mild winters. Even the prolonged winter weather of early 2013, which lasted till the end of May was not cold 
enough. Perhaps __ cold winter of early 2013 just reflected __ ‘pause’ in GW. 
Although most climate research seems to prove the existence of GW, there is no general agreement on 
its cause, although, on 30 May 2013, The Daily Telegraph (DT) reported that ‘one recent survey of 12,000 
academic papers agreed that human activists were causing the planet to warm’. However, the next day, 
this interpretation of the figures was corrected on the ‘Letters’ page (DT, 31 May 2013): 
	
‘It is not true that 97 per cent of academic papers supported the Anthropogenic Global Warming 
(AGW) theory. Around 37 per cent of papers endorsed AGW while 60 per cent stated no position 
for or against AGW. ’
The rest of the papers, 3 per cent, reject the idea of AGW, or even GW as a whole concept. 
A hypothesis put forward by both AGW and GW deniers is that, over the course of geological time, the 
Earth has undergone a natural cycle of warming and cooling. Indeed, it is true that ‘several million years 
ago…the Arctic was ice-free, savannah spread across the desert and sea level16* was up to 40 metres 
higher than today’ (The Guardian Weekly, 17 May 2013). Recently, fossil evidence of camels has been 
found in the frozen Arctic wastes. However, this kind of refutation of GW as a recent phenomenon, 
does not always hold when we recall that 200 million years ago, current Northern countries, like the 
UK and Sweden, were situated South of the Equator, where a tropical climate might be expected, so it 
is not surprising that their geological strata record a different climate from today.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Nevertheless, whatever the cause of GW, it is of the utmost importance for the future of the planet to 
take some practical steps to mitigate GW effects. Bjørn Lomborg is a statistician, who is perhaps the 
climate change sceptic because of his book The Skeptical Environmentalist (Lomborg 1998). In fact, he 
is not a climate change denier, and does believe that: 
	
‘Global warming, though its size and future projections are unrealistically pessimistic, is almost 
certainly taking place’ (ibid., Part 1, Chapter 1: 4). 
But he also believes that: 
	
‘Global warming is not anywhere near the most important problem facing the world’ [Lomborg’s 
own italics] (ibid., Part V, Chapter 24: 243). 
Moreover, he is convinced that the correct response to GW is not the prevention of, but the adaptation 
to, climate change, which is the less costly option by far. When his book was denounced by the Danish 
Committee for Scientific Dishonesty, he wrote to the Wall Street Journal (‘Why are the Greens afraid of 
me?’, 23 January 2003): 
	
‘I am Danish…a former member of Greenpeace; and I used to believe in the litany of our ever-
deteriorating environment…this litany doesn’t seem to be backed up by the facts…. This is 
most obvious in the discussion over global warming…economic analyses show that it will be 
far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions radically than to pay the costs of adaption 
to increased temperatures.’

ambitious measures as a global system of ‘space sunshades’ (Wikipedia, accessed 1/6/13). But, apart from 
the cost, what else is the matter with such important ideas? The difficulty is that they are not politically 
acceptable solutions. They require a unique effort of cooperation on an international scale, and there 
is too big a risk there might be unintended consequences. A more economically viable and sustainable 
option is carbon capture and storage (CCS). So far, no such facility is in operation, but Shell has taken 
the decision to build a CCS plant in Canada. 
In the meantime, firms are beginning to practise Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) so that their 
activities will be carbon neutral and therefore sustainable (Pinkse & Kolk 2009).
So the debate about GW continues. It is a difficult time for humanity. At the time of writing (June 
2013), towns along the Rhine and the Danube are awash with record floods. Had Benjamin Franklin, 
an American, still been alive today, perhaps he would, unlike many of his recent political successors, 
have extended his short list of life’s certainties to read: 
‘Death, Taxes, and Climate Change’.

its currently impenetrable ice cap, but for the23 future there is a48 plan to exploit them. The45 plan will be 
realized if GW continues. Across the26 Arctic regions, the28 Russians, the28 Canadians and the28 Chinese 
are competing for the23 rich reserves. Moreover, land3 in Northern Russia13, Greenland13 and Northern 
Canada13 could become available for agriculture3. Further South, single-cropped areas1 could become 
double-cropped. In more temperate zones, English farmers1, for example, could grow Mediterranean 
fruits1, and supply channels1 will be disrupted less often as there will be less snow5 and ice5. However, 
climate change5 will bring, and indeed some say is already bringing, an49 increase in extreme weather5. 
Summers1 will become too hot, winters1 too cold. Floods1 will alternate with droughts1 in the23 same area. 
In the68 most alarmist scenario, during a48 freak flood, sea level1 is predicted to rise as high as the23, 38 
top of the27 Statue of Liberty or Nelson’s Column13.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
While governments1 are becoming convinced about climate change5, social surveys1 show that public 
scepticism2 is growing. The people71 are not convinced. Nevertheless, an49, 51 enormous amount of 
information4 about GW5 is gradually building up. There has been a48 great number of academic books10 
and papers1 on the23 subject, which provide a57 deeper knowledge of the23 GW mechanism. Climate 
theory7 is a48 new and expanding field, which has been developed by 20th and 21st century scientists20. In 
recent decades1, the24 computer has made it easier to run models1 which can attempt to forecast climate 
change5. Even so, a48 Professor of Climatology at the23, 38 Climate Research Unit of the39 University of 
East Anglia13 had to defend his research staff when an49 email came to light that admitted to using a48 
‘statistical trick’ to demonstrate the23 GW trend. This was, in fact, an49 acceptable scientific method. 
Figure 117 below illustrates how raw statistics3 might be misleading, and especially so depending on how 
they are presented. The23 figure is a72 historical analysis of the23 occurrence of a48 long-distance outdoor 
Dutch ice-skating race, the48 ‘Elfstedentocht’ (the23 11 towns route) which dates from 1909. It can only be 
held in those years when the25 winter ice is thick enough. Sometimes it occurs in two consecutive years 
but it has never occurred more than once a63 year. The23 figure clearly shows that there were considerably 
more Elfstedentochts (11) in the43 first 50 years after 1909 than in the43 next 50 years right up to the43 
present day (4), which might ‘prove’ the23, 38 existence of GW5. However, as the23 race became increasingly 
popular over the23 century, the23 explanation for the23 decrease in the23, 38 number of races may be that it 
became necessary for the25 canal ice to be much thicker than it was in the43 early years, to bear the23, 38 
weight of the extra competitors. 
Figure 1: Number17 of Elfstedentochts1 (natural canal-ice races1) per decade in the31 Netherlands since 1909 (the23 1st 
Elfstedentocht) 
Note: So far, up to late 2013, in the23 decade beginning 2009 there have been no Elfstedentochts, as was also the23 case for the23 previous 
decade 1999–2008, because of the23 mild winters. Even the23, 8 prolonged winter weather5 of early 2013, which lasted till the23 end of 
May6 was not cold enough. Perhaps the23 cold winter of early 2013 just reflected the23 ‘pause’ in GW.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Although most climate research3 seems to prove the23 existence of GW5, there is no general agreement 
on its cause, although, on 30 May6 2013, The47 Daily Telegraph (DT18) reported that ‘one recent survey 
of 12,000 academic papers agreed that human activists were causing the31 planet to warm’. However, 
the43next day, this interpretation of the23 figures was corrected on the23 ‘Letters’ page (DT, 31 May 2013): 
‘It is not true that 97 per cent1 of academic papers1 supported the23 Anthropogenic Global 
Warming (AGW) theory. Around 37 per cent1 of papers endorsed AGW5 while 60 per cent10 
stated no position for or against AGW.’
 The32, 38 rest of the papers, 3 per cent10, reject the23 idea of AGW5, or even GW as a48 whole concept. 
A72 hypothesis put forward by both11 AGW and GW deniers is that, over the23, 38 course of geological 
time2, the31 Earth has undergone a48 natural cycle of warming and cooling8. Indeed, it is true that ‘several 
million years1 ago…the31 Arctic was ice-free, savannah1 spread across the26 desert and sea level1 was up 
to 40 metres10 higher than today’ (The43 Guardian Weekly, 17 May 2013). Recently, fossil evidence4 of 
camels1 has been found in the25 frozen Arctic wastes. However, this kind of refutation4 of GW5 as a48 
recent phenomenon, does not always hold when we recall that 200 million years10 ago, current Northern 
countries, like the40 UK and Sweden13, were situated South of the31 Equator, where a48 tropical climate 
might be expected, so it is not surprising that their geological strata record a48 different climate from 
today, now they have migrated with continental drift1 to Northern climes.

Final remarks on the use of the and a/an (not always as articles)
Nevertheless, whatever the23, 38 cause of GW5, it is of the68 utmost importance for the23, 38 future of the31 
Planet to take some66 practical steps to mitigate GW effects1. Bjørn15 Lomborg is a50 statistician, who 
is perhaps the34 climate change sceptic because of his book The23 Skeptical Environmentalist (Lomborg 
1998). In fact, he is not a48 climate change denier, and does believe that: 
‘Global warming5, though its size and future projections are unrealistically pessimistic, is almost 
certainly taking place’ (ibid., Part 117, Chapter 117: 4). 
But he also believes that: 
‘Global warming5 is not anywhere near the67 most important problem facing the30 world’ [Lomborg’s9 
own italics] (ibid., Part V17, Chapter 2417: 243). 
Moreover, he is convinced that the23 correct response to GW5 is not the23, 38 prevention of, but the23 
adaptation to, climate change5, which is the67 less costly option by far. When his book was denounced 
by the30,80 Danish Committee for Scientific Dishonesty2, he wrote to the47 Wall Street Journal (‘Why are 
the30 Greens afraid of me?’, 23 January 2003): 
I am Danish21…a48 former member of Greenpeace16; and I used to believe in the23, 38 litany of 
our ever-deteriorating environment…this litany doesn’t seem to be backed up by the23 facts…
This is most obvious in the23 discussion over global warming5…economic analyses1 show that it 
will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions3 radically than to pay the23, 38 costs 
of adaption1 to increased temperatures1. 
He feels governments1 cannot make that big an74 investment in preventing change5. But many of his critics 
are of the48 opinion he is not as good a61 statistician as he thinks. In particular, Lomborg15 is criticized 
for not rigorously subjecting his raw data to tests1 of statistical significance2 (e.g. the46 chi square test), 
and for ignoring the23, 38 existence of scientific uncertainty2 (Van den Bergh 2010). 
But what can realistically be done? In the36, 38 case of adaptation1, the23 worldwide recession means that 
governments1 do not have the69 money for the23, 38 large amount of investment10 that would be necessary 
for such ambitious measures as a48 global system of ‘space sunshades’1 (Wikipedia, accessed 1/6/13). But, 
apart from the23 cost, what else is the70 matter with such important ideas? The23 difficulty is that they are 
not politically acceptable solutions1. They require a48 unique effort of cooperation2 on an49 international 
scale, and there is too big a73 risk there might be unintended consequences2. A67 more economically viable 
and sustainable option is carbon capture and storage1 (CCS). So far, no such facility is in operation, but 
Shell13 has taken the decision to build a48 CCS plant in Canada13. 
In the23 meantime, firms1 are beginning to practise Corporate Social Responsibility2 (CSR) so that their 
activities will be carbon neutral and therefore sustainable (see Pinkse and Kolk 2009).

So the23 debate about GW5 continues. It is a48 difficult time for humanity14. At the23 time of writing 
(June6 2013), towns1 along the26 Rhine and the26 Danube are awash77 with record floods1. Had Benjamin 
Franklin15, an64 American, still been alive today, perhaps he would, unlike many of his recent political 
successors, have extended his short list of life’s certainties2 to read: 
 ‘Death2, Taxes3, and Climate Change5’.

Concludin g remar ks to  
Chapte r 
Section 6: Concluding remarks to 
Chapter 5
It may seem that a disproportionate amount of space has been devoted to the use of the definite and 
indefinite articles, but for EFL authors in many parts of the world, this is their major difficulty, and most 
of these 80 Rules relate to the actual mistakes they make. When Matthew Norman (Daily Telegraph, 19 
January 2013: B9) wrote a column in pretend ‘Chinglish’ (i.e. English supposedly written by an educated 
Chinese person), for authenticity, he omitted the articles, as in [missing articles shown in square brackets]: 
‘In [an] ideal world, there would be [an] even more efficacious solution to [the] problem of getting paid 
for no work.’
This chapter with its detailed classification of the articles has come a long way from the basic assertion 
that the is used when referring to particular persons or things, and a/an is used in general contexts. 
Nevertheless, in spite of the lengthy unpacking of the grammar of the and a/an in this discussion, it still 
cannot be claimed that no stone has been left unturned in the exploration of this linguistic minefield, 
where surprises keep popping up even for native speakers.
The hallmark of a well-written English text by EFL students is the correct use of the and a/an, either as 
the definite and indefinite articles or as other parts of speech. This final chapter has aimed to bring all 
this together with illuminating examples and two tests that teach as well as assess. If all this explanation 
still seems complicated, the reader should be comforted by the knowledge that modern English has 
moved on from the Old English of the Dark Ages, with its far more complicated matrix of genders and 
declensions of cases, from which the present three little words have evolved.
Postscript
One last complication: there may be some instances where, even after studying all the rules here, you just 
cannot decide whether to use the, a/an, or no article. Such is the eccentricity of the English language, 
however, that sometimes it may not really matter what you do. That is why in Chapter 5, in the first 
Diagnostic Test in Section 2, and in the more extensive test in Section 5, very occasionally more than 
one ‘correct’ answer is possible. Nevertheless, in most cases, there is no ambiguity, and the final reference 
essay should help EFL authors to use the articles correctly in their own sentences, in any context.

Chapte r 
Those who may feel daunted by all this detail may wish to try an even simpler ‘starter’ test that can 
be used to practise the use of the definite and indefinite articles, and which is reasonably relevant for 
students and professors of economics and business studies. This is the group of exercises in Section 36 
of Oxford Business English and Practice (Michael Duckworth, Oxford University Press, 2004). These 
exercises are not backed up by any explanation, but could be used in conjunction with the information 
contained in this chapter.
