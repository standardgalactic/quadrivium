About the Author
NJAMES FLOYD KELLY is a freelance writer who lives in Atlanta, Georgia. He has degrees in both 
English and Industrial Engineering, because he couldn’t decide between majoring in liberal 
arts or math and science. Fortunately, technical writing uses both sides of the brain, and 
he has been able to write on a variety of topics, including LEGO robotics, free software, and 
building a custom computer. James is also the editor in chief of the number one LEGO NXT 
Robotics blog, The NXT Step (dppl6++sss*pdajtpopal*_ki). When not writing, he and his wife 
enjoy watching their little boy discover all kinds of new and exciting things about the world.

Acknowledgments
Writing a book is not a solitary job, as one might think. The book you’re holding in your 
hands is the result of the hard work of a large collection of people at Apress. The team at 
Apress did so much more than just fix my misspelled words and tighten up some sentences to 
make them more readable. During the writing of this book, I actually learned how to be a bet-
ter writer. And for that, I can thank five outstanding individuals: Dominic Shakeshaft, Joohn 
Choe, Jonathan Gennick, Steve Nieman, and Marilyn Smith. This group of editors taught me 
everything from properly using headers to formatting monetary amounts. They suggested new 
software to cover, new web sites to reference, and, in many instances, new text to add. It was a 
pleasure working with all of them. (And Jonathan, I will never again forget to include introduc-
tory text after a new head.)
This is the first book in a new series from Apress, and I’m happy with the final results. I’d 
also like to thank Ellie Fountain for the layout of the chapters, and Kurt Krames for the nice 
cover design that is shared by the books in this series.
As for my wife, Ashley, I cannot thank her enough for her support as I changed careers 
and switched to “this writing thing.” She just received 1,000,000 Great Wife points. Spend 
them recklessly.
And finally, there are three teachers who probably have no idea how influential they 
were on my education and career choices. Now, only 20+ years late, I must thank Arthur 
Schang (Physics), Don Louis Lynn, Jr. (Calculus), and Janice Watts (English) for their 
encouragement and special teaching methodologies that spurred my interest in math, sci-
ence, writing, and literature. My education and career have both benefited from being a 
student in their classrooms.

Introduction
Computers are getting cheaper and cheaper. It’s not uncommon to find new PCs for sale 
for under $200 these days. We’re not quite at the stage where you can go buy a replacement 
computer in the same way as you purchase a new toaster, but we’re close. In fact, one day 
computers may be given away with the purchase of a new piece of software.
Ah, software—there’s the rub. Software has not dropped in price. As a matter of fact, soft-
ware costs keep going up, and there’s no end in sight. It’s not uncommon to spend $200 or 
more for a big-name application to install on your computer. I’m not suggesting that software 
isn’t worth the price. What I’m saying is that it’s almost impossible today to spend less on soft-
ware than you did on the computer to run it! 
But there are exceptions. Low-cost software exists. But would you believe that you can 
get high-quality software that won’t cost you a dime? Well, that’s what this book is all about: 
free software. 
Free.
No strings attached. 
No credit card required.
No 30-day trial period.
Zilch. Nada. Zip.
Don’t believe me? That’s okay; skepticism is good. I didn’t believe that free high-quality 
software existed either. But now I’m a convert, and that’s why I wrote this book. 
I’m not anti-Microsoft or anti-Adobe or against any other big software provider, but I 
don’t want to spend a lot of money for software features I won’t use. And that’s the problem 
with expensive software these days: feature overload with a matching price overload. Give me 
some good software that can do what I need it to do, without all the bells and whistles. And if it 
turns out to be free? Woo hoo! Say it with me: Woo! Hoo!
So, sit down, keep reading, and be prepared for many happy surprises. You may not need 
every piece of free software I cover in this book, but I’m fairly certain you’ll find at least one 
that you can use (and that will more than cover the cost of the book). 
Welcome to the world of free software. And spread the word.
What Type of Software Do You Want?
With the exception of the first two chapters, each chapter in this book is about a different type 
of software. In many cases, I’ll cover the defenders (the popular and usually pricey applica-
tions) and the contenders (the free versions), so you can compare their features. 

NINTRODUCTION

Here’s a chapter-by-chapter rundown:
Chapter 1, The Best Things in Life: There are all kinds of free software, but two important 
categories of free software are open source and Software as a Service (SaaS). This chapter 
explains how these two types of software differ from just any old free software you find 
floating around on the Internet.
Chapter 2, The PC Element: Free software will definitely save you money, but you can go 
one step further by loading it on a computer you already have, or even building your own 
low-cost PC. This chapter explains how you can save money when it comes to computer 
hardware.
Chapter 3, Word Processing: One of the most common uses for a computer is composing 
letters, e-mail, and other types of text files. Most people expect to find some sort of word 
processing software installed on any computer they use. This chapter covers one of the 
biggest names in word processing, and then provides two free alternatives for you to con-
sider, along with some sample tasks using each.
Chapter 4, Spreadsheets: Spreadsheets aren’t just for accountants. This chapter introduces 
two free alternatives to the big-name spreadsheet application, along with a collection of 
sample tasks that demonstrate the usefulness of the 100% free challengers.
Chapter 5, Slide Shows: Presentations are one of the key methods used by businesses and 
individuals to share information with others. This chapter describes two free alternatives 
to the most popular slide show application used today. You’ll also see some examples of 
how each application can be used in ways you might not have considered before.
Chapter 6, E-Mail and Calendar: An e-mail address is almost an absolute requirement 
for living in today’s world, and a personal calendar can help you stay organized. One 
of the biggest names on the Internet today, Google, offers free e-mail and calendar ser-
vices. This chapter shows you just how handy these two free applications are and why 
you should use them.
Chapter 7, Photo Editing: A powerful photo editing application that is 100% free to down-
load, install, and use? This chapter introduces you to one of free software’s biggest success 
stories. You will learn where to get it, how to install it, and how to use it.
Chapter 8, Graphics: Applications for creating custom graphics have traditionally been 
expensive and difficult to use. One up-and-coming application is changing all that. Both 
professional and nonprofessional users are praising this free software for its features and 
ease of use. Here, you’ll learn about this new application and how to use some of its basic 
features.
Chapter 9, Virus Protection: All computers are at risk of attack from the malicious software 
that exists on the Internet and on other users’ computers. One of the best antivirus appli-
cations available for your computer is also completely free to download and use, as well as 
extremely easy to set up to protect your computer automatically. This chapter covers this 
free application, including step-by-step instructions for configuring it so your computer is 
protected.

Chapter 10, Data Backup: Along with protecting your computer from viruses, you need to 
consider making backups of all your important files. This chapter introduces you to a free 
application that will help you make copies of your files, and shows you how to automate 
the process. 
Chapter 11, Personal Finance: You’re reading a book about free software because you 
want to save some money, right? Well, this chapter shows you how a free application can 
help you track your bank account, including deposits and expenses. Doesn’t it make more 
sense to use a free application for financial tracking than to pay for one?
Chapter 12, Gaming: Online gaming is extremely popular, but unfortunately, it can also be 
extremely expensive when you’re paying a monthly fee to play. This chapter focuses on a 
free alternative to the biggest name in online gaming. You’ll find out how to start playing 
immediately and have some fun with fellow gamers from around the world.
Chapter 13, Photo Management: If you take digital pictures, you’ve probably snapped a 
few bad shots. Bad lighting or red eye can ruin a great picture. And if you have a lot of 
digital photos on your hard drive, keeping track of them can be a huge time burden. This 
chapter shows you one of the easiest and most fun applications you can find for solving 
your digital photo problems, and it’s 100% free.
Chapter 14, Internet Phone Calls: This chapter introduces one of the easiest and cheapest 
ways to talk to your friends and family. If you have an Internet connection and a micro-
phone, you can make free local and long-distance calls—even free international calls! And 
if you have a webcam, you can see the people you’re talking with and give them a wave. 
Chapter 15, Web Logs: An extremely popular type of media is the web log, or blog. This 
chapter explains how you, too, can start sharing your news, photos, and opinions with the 
rest of the world by by creating your own blog using an online blogging application that 
also just happens to be completely free. 
Chapter 16, Social Networking: Social networking lets you keep friends, family, and 
coworkers up-to-date on your vacation news, pictures, videos, and more. This chapter 
shows you one of the best (and totally free) services for finding friends, old and new, and 
keeping your list of contacts informed about what’s going on in your life.
Chapter 17, Group Scheduling: If you’ve ever tried to organize any kind of get-together 
(group movie, birthday party, and so on), then you’re going to love the free service this 
chapter introduces. You will see how to use this online service to narrow down the best 
time and day for the maximum number of people to attend your next event.
At the back of the book, you’ll find an appendix with brief descriptions of some additional 
free applications and services that I believe are worth mentioning.

The Best Things in Life 
As the song says, “The best things in life are free.” That statement can apply to numerous 
things: free coffee, free oil change, free Wi-Fi Internet, and even a free blood pressure check. 
But how many of us would expect to find computer software on that list? If you’re like me, 
you’ve discovered that software costs money. You might also be of the opinion that good soft-
ware costs more money. And finally, you might have come to the matching conclusion that free 
software must not be that good.
Well, I’m here to tell you that I’ve never been so happy to be wrong. And by the end of this 
book, I think you, too, will be smiling when you discover that some of the best software in life 
is free.
Yes, the words free and software in the same sentence can sometimes still imply comput-
ers crashing, flaky installations, and cryptic controls. Unfortunately, the world of free software 
still has many hurdles to overcome. But rest assured that there are outstanding, five-star, free 
software applications out there that stand with the best and the brightest. And they’re growing 
in popularity and number every day. This is because they are getting easier to use and install, 
and are frequently on par in terms of quality (and sometimes 100% better) and features as 
those from the Big Boys (and you know who I mean). You’ll find free software that fills a void 
that pay-to-use software does not address, and free software written as a labor of love, with no 
strings attached to its use.
Free software raises many questions. Can this software really offer me the features I need? 
Can the software be trusted? Who do I contact if I have problems or questions? Are there hid-
den costs? How do I separate the wheat from the chaff? These are some good questions, and 
I’m sure you have more. I had my doubts when I started investigating free software, but again, 
I’ve never been so pleased to be so wrong.
You’re about to discover what I did: the words free and software do belong together. Let 
me explain how and why.
Software Wants to Be Free
Without getting too deep into the history of computing, let me summarize the early days of 
software in one sentence:
In the beginning, there was software, and it was free.
I’m not kidding. One of the biggest shocks to most people is finding out that software 
originally was free. Students and faculty at colleges and universities would create and share 
1

CHAPTER 1 N  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE

software with one another; no money exchanged hands. Most software at the time was writ-
ten to fill a void—scheduling software for classes, simple text editing software for term papers, 
and even rudimentary e-mail software to communicate. Other software (games, for example) 
was written simply to show off programming skills or provide a nice break between classes and 
studying. Oftentimes, this software was modified by others to improve it and remove errors 
(called software bugs). But the Iron Age of software (some might even say the Golden Age) 
didn’t last long. For software, as with all things, the users turned into consumers.
The public today has just come to assume that software is something you buy. Free soft-
ware has always existed, but any software that is even remotely of interest to ten or more 
people is typically going to be boxed, priced, and stuck on a shelf.
But many modern-day programmers who create software have looked fondly back on 
those days and asked, “What would it take to return software to its origins?” What’s required 
to have software shared with everyone, updated and repaired by colleagues, and 100% free to 
use? The answer is that it wouldn’t take much.
Software Will Be Free
Today and any day, you can find all types of free software on the Internet. Just Google “free 
software,” and you’ll find hundreds of web sites that collect, summarize, and rate software, in 
addition to allowing you to download and install it. All right—free software!
But let’s be careful here and examine what is meant by free. For me, free means I can 
download it without providing a credit card. But free also means that when I install the pro-
gram, it shouldn’t ask me for a credit card number or an installation key. But again, there are 
different definitions.
Some “free” software allows you to use it for a specified number of days (30 days, for 
example), and then requires you to either purchase it or uninstall it. This is often referred to as 
trialware or shareware. Other free software can be downloaded for free and installed on your 
computer, but consists of a slimmed-down version, often with many key features unavailable. 
The only way you can get the full feature set is to—you guessed it—purchase the full version.
There are many ways to define free, but for the purpose of this book, I want to share 
three varieties with you: open source, Software as a Service, and what I sometimes call the 
no-strings-attached freebie.
Open Source
Entire books have been written on the subject of open source software. Here, I’m going to 
spare you the essay, and simply give you what I feel is a simple, no-frills definition of what 
open source software is, how it works, and what it means to you.
An open source application is software that has the following characteristics:
s #REATED USING A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY INDIVIDUALS WHO SHARE A COMMON INTEREST IN
producing an application of the highest quality
s $ISTRIBUTED FOR FREE AND KEPT FREE	
s #ONTINUALLY REFINED AND IMPROVED BY REDUCING BUGS AND ADDING FEATURES REQUESTED BY
its users

CHAPTER 1 N  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE 
3
Open source software can include a variety of applications, such as word processors, 
spreadsheets, games, audio/video editors, and so on. 
There are many benefits to using open source software, but the primary one for most 
people will be its cost: free. But if the software were low-quality, buggy, and not of any real 
use to people, the fact that it’s free wouldn’t matter much, because people wouldn’t use it. So 
that’s another benefit of open source software: quality. 
Open source software is often being developed and tested by a group of knowledgeable 
programmers. This group might consist of two friends creating a game during their lunch 
hour. It could just as easily consist of 2,000 individuals scattered around the globe, who may 
never have met in person, contributing to and debugging one another’s work around the 
clock. But one goal open source developers share is to create something that is of high quality.
And the “free” part of open source doesn’t just apply to the application but also to its 
source code. The source code consists of the actual programming code that is used to create 
the application. If an application is defined as open source, this means that its source code 
is available for download so other programmers can inspect it and tinker with it. In fact, in 
some cases, programmers create a completely different version of an open source application 
by adding features or modifying the look and style. (But the variant source code must also be 
made available for free download and inspection or it loses the open source label.) 
Finally, the group developing an open source application that is popular among users will, 
inevitably, receive requests for bug fixes and new features. Open source application develop-
ers typically are committed to continually improving an application to try to make it the best 
in class for a particular type of application (such as a word processor or graphics editor).
Open source isn’t perfect. I want to make that absolutely clear. A lot of junky open source 
software is out there. But you can rest assured that the software I identify as open source in 
this book is some of the best you can find—it meets the high-quality criterion, as well as being 
free.
Software as a Service
Have you ever used a drive-through (or walk-up) ATM to get some cash? You probably used a 
computer screen and maybe a keypad to enter things such as your PIN and the amount of cash 
TO WITHDRAW 4O GET YOUR MONEY YOU USED SOFTWARE RIGHT $ID YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE
ON THE !4- $EFINITELY NOT 9OU USED THE SOFTWARE THAT WAS ALREADY PROVIDED BY THE BANK 4HE
bank, on the other hand, had to create the software, test it, debug it, and install it on the ATM 
for your use. But you don’t care how it came to be. Your only concern is that it works properly 
and lets you get your cash!
For purposes of this book, I’m going to use the term Software as a Service (SaaS for short, 
pronounced “sass”) to describe a type of software that is growing in popularity. The primary 
difference between SaaS and open source software comes down to where the software resides. 
Is it installed on your computer or elsewhere?
NNote Along with where the software resides, there are other differences between open source and SaaS. 
By the time you finish this book, you’ll have a clearer understanding of how to differentiate the two. For now, 
just keep in mind that SaaS applications can easily be identified by the fact that you don’t need to install any 
software on your computer to use them. 

CHAPTER 1 N  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE 
4
To make this more clear, let’s consider online banking for a moment. Most banks allow 
their customers with Internet access to use a web browser to log in and access their account 
information. A customer doesn’t need to install any special software (other than the web 
browser, of course), but she uses some very specialized software that’s provided by the bank to 
view her balance, transfer funds, and maybe print out a monthly statement. When she closes 
the web browser or logs out of the bank web site, the software is no longer running on the cus-
tomer’s computer. That’s the basic concept behind SaaS. Use it when you need it, and leave it 
when you don’t. There is no need to install or uninstall the software.
These days, more and more companies are offering various services through their web 
sites. Some require you to pay a one-time fee (such as paying for two hours of Wi-Fi Internet 
access at a coffee shop). Others require a monthly subscription (such as an online newspaper 
subscription for The New York Times). These qualify as SaaS, even though they are not free, 
because the software you use to log in and perform tasks resides elsewhere; you’re just access-
ing it from your web browser.
So what qualifies as free SaaS? Well, one of the biggest names in the industry offers free 
SaaS, and most people never even think about it. Imagine if you were charged a small fee every 
time you did an Internet search on Google (see Figure 1-1). You would probably never use it, 
right? Fortunately, Google makes its search engine completely free to use. It generates revenue 
from advertisers (yuck!), who place their ads on the right side of your web browser and hope 
that you’ll see something interesting, click their ad, and buy, buy, buy.
Figure 1-1. Thank goodness that Google doesn’t charge every time you click that search button.
There are plenty more 100% free SaaS web sites. For example, ?JJ*_ki offers free news ser-
vices, and _n]ecoheop*knc lets you buy and sell items using posted ads. I’m going to introduce 
you to many free SaaS sites in upcoming chapters. By the time you finish this book, you’ll have 
a collection of SaaS web sites that make your life much easier. You’re going to be e-mailing me, 
asking when Don’t Spend a Dime, Volume 2 is coming out!

CHAPTER 1 N  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE 
5
No-Strings-Attached Freebie
The last type of free software I’ll talk about has been around forever. It’s the 100% free applica-
tion that someone created and put out there for the world to use. This software costs nothing, 
but also typically comes with nothing—no support, no web site, no phone number, and no 
updates. Usually, the people who create this type of free software do so because they need a 
particular functionality and cannot find any existing software that provides it. Typically, these 
folks share their software with the world, expecting no payment in return (just as in the early 
days of software!).
Hundreds of web sites offer access to free software. Just do a Google search for “free 
software” and be prepared to be overwhelmed. One of my favorite places to go when I’m 
looking for an application to do something very specific is dppl6++sss*oj]lbehao*_ki. Take a 
quick look at this web site. In the upper-right corner, you’ll see a tab for Shareware and a tab 
for Freeware. Click the Freeware tab, and you’ll see a categorized listing of everything Snap-
Files offers that is free, as shown in Figure 1-2. (Be careful—you could spend hours browsing 
through this site’s free software.)
Figure 1-2. SnapFiles offers thousands of freeware applications for you to use.

CHAPTER 1 N  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE

WHAT’S THE CATCH?
You may be thinking that there must be a catch. There’s no such thing as free! You’re right—sort of. High-
quality software that is 100% free with no strings attached does exist. Open source software is the best 
example. But someone has to pay for those computers that run SaaS, and there are many ways this can 
occur. 
Some companies (Google, for example) cover the costs of their free applications through advertising. 
Head over to dppl6++sss*ckkcha*_ki and do a search for “Star Wars.” When you see the results page, 
look along the right edge of the screen. See the small blocks of advertisements? Those companies are pay-
ing Google to have their advertisements placed so you (possibly a Star Wars movie fan) can find and buy all 
kinds of Star Wars memorabilia. But being exposed to ads is not a big sacrifice for access to Google’s free 
applications.
Some companies charge fees for technical support. For example, if you find you have a question about 
the software, a $25 phone call will get you the answer. Some companies charge fees for multiple users 
beyond the first user. Others charge a fee if you need customization of the application (such as adding your 
company name or logo to the application’s opening screen).
The methods for generating income vary from company to company, but my best advice to you is to 
always read the fine print. Spend some time looking around the application’s web site, and maybe perform a 
Google search of the application’s name. You’re sure to find information that will either verify the software’s 
free cost or give you information about any hidden costs. That said, all of the software I cover in this book is 
free to download, install, and use. If there are any hidden costs or unusual methods for generating income, I 
will explain that in the discussion of that application.
But What About the PC?
Yes, the computer (the hardware) costs money. Even if you’ve been given a free computer 
as a hand-me-down, that PC required someone to spend money at some point in time. It’s 
an unfortunate truth that there really is no such thing as an open source PC, with all its parts 
made and distributed for free.
For most of us, obtaining a computer usually requires buying one from a PC company 
SUCH AS $ELL OR !CER	 4HIS ISNT NECESSARILY A BAD THING THOUGH 0URCHASING A PREBUILT 0#
provides you with a warranty, someone to call when things go wrong, and that new-computer 
smell (admit it—you like it, too).
If you’re buying a new PC, you might want to find a company that allows you to order 
your new computer without any preinstalled software. Why have them install a $30 antivirus 
program when you can get some great antivirus software for free? (Chapter 9 tells you where.) 
Maybe the computer vendor offers to throw in a productivity suite (word processor, spread-
sheet, and e-mail application) for only $150 (versus its retail price of $300 at the store). Tell 
them to forget it! Chapters 3 through 6 show you where to get the same features using reliable, 
easy-to-use, free software.
The best part of steering clear of pricey off-the-shelf software is that you can take the 
money you would have spent on that software and use it to get higher-performing hardware. 
You can put that cash toward a faster processor, more memory, and a larger hard drive. Not 
only will the free software run more efficiently (and take less hard drive space) on your new 
computer, but you will also have extended the usefulness of your computer by years. 

CHAPTER 1 N  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE

If you’ve decided to purchase a new computer or build your own, you’ll want to read 
through Chapter 2 next. There, I’ll show you how to determine exactly what hardware you 
need. Not everyone will need the fastest PC with all the bells and whistles. In the world of com-
puters, people frequently purchase more than they need. If you do this, the computer sellers 
will love you, but your bank account won’t be so happy. Fortunately, open source software and 
SaaS typically have lower demands for computer hardware, meaning you can save even more 
money by pairing free software with the lower hardware costs. Now that’s a win-win solution!
RECOMMENDED READING
If you have any interest in the history of computers and software, you owe it to yourself to hunt down a few 
books:
s Hackers by Steven Levy (Penguin, 2001) isn’t about those troublesome, virus-writing, break-
into-computers-and-steal-credit-card-numbers bad guys. Back in the day, the term hacker was a 
positive one (and it’s coming full circle and regaining its status). Hacker referred to anyone who could 
take hardware or software and remake it, debug it, tweak it, and do other wondrous things. This book 
covers from the early days at MIT, when a bunch of model railroad fanatics began experimenting with 
controlling their trains with simple electronic circuits, to the humble beginnings of Microsoft and Apple. 
It’s some good storytelling.
s Dreaming in Code by Scott Rosenberg (Three Rivers Press, 2008) is an entertaining story about a small 
group of individuals who decided to create an open source application. The book covers the highs and 
lows, and the successes and failures. It also explains the open source concept in detail.
s On the Way to the Web by Michael A. Banks (Apress, 2008) is a history of the Internet, including its 
origins, its successes, and its mistakes. This is a great read and helps you understand how the Internet 
got where it is today. 
Summary
Many computer users are tired of buying software that is buggy, complicated, and overpriced. 
And since much of this software is updated every year or two, we can quickly find ourselves in 
a never-ending cycle of purchasing upgrades.
Enough is enough! With a minimum investment in hardware (possibly even $0), you have 
a wide selection of free, high-quality software that can save you from this dependency on big-
name applications.
My advice is simple. Investigate the options and determine if the free software will meet 
your needs. If you do find that your needs can be met only by using the features found in an 
off-the-shelf application, then it’s okay to buy that application. 
In preparing this book, I made a list of the types of software that would most likely be 
found on users’ PCs. I then picked the most commonly used name brand of each type of soft-
ware and researched, found, installed, and tested what I believe to be the best, most realistic 
replacements that are 100% free. Read through the book and discover for yourself how easy it 
is to never pay for software again.

C H A P T E R  2
The PC Element
When it comes to your computer’s usable life (well, the amount of time it will be useful to 
you), the only two things that matter are the hardware and the software. Both hardware and 
software grow old and become obsolete, but at extremely different rates. There are businesses 
still running or trying to run Windows 95-generation business software (such as QuickBooks 
95) on Windows Vista desktops (a more than 12-year-old operating system’s software on the 
latest version of Microsoft’s operating system). And there are many home users who are trying 
to install and run Word 2007 software on their Windows 98 computer. It’s an unfair fact of life, 
but hardware and software do not grow old gracefully together like that sweet, old couple who 
lives a few houses down the road.
NNote This book is about free software that runs on the Windows operating system. Fortunately, much of 
the software is also available in Mac and Linux versions. So, when I use the term PC, please understand that 
I’m typically referring to a Windows XP or Windows Vista computer. Feel free to substitute in Mac or Linux if 
you like, and you can certainly apply much of this discussion to those two types of computers.
It’s a hard life cycle to accept: for a few months or maybe a year, there will be large advances 
in hardware technology, and software might work on a new computer but special features will 
be disabled for compatibility. And then it flips for a while, and organizations start releasing 
software that you cannot install on your PC, because that software requires a specific hardware 
component to be running at a specific speed (a high-end graphic card, for example) or due to 
some other technological hindrance. Trying to keep your computer up-to-date with the latest 
and greatest hardware and software is frustrating and expensive. Some suggest it’s a conspiracy 
between hardware and software companies to keep the funds flowing. But there’s good news. 
The hardware and software update/upgrade dance is quickly becoming an obsolete busi-
ness method that you’re no longer forced to be a participant in, all thanks to free, open source 
software and Software as a Service (SaaS) web-based applications.
This chapter focuses on hardware, which may seem out of place in a book dedicated to 
free software. But the information in this chapter is about simply one more way to spend less 
money—either by refurbishing an existing PC or by buying the minimum hardware you’ll need 
to do the work you require. Either way, I’ll offer some guidance on how to get a PC and how 
that PC should be equipped. The goal here is to save you money, as well get you the proper 
hardware that’s compatible with the software covered in later chapters.

To Buy or Not to Buy (with Apologies to William)
Right now, three (legal) solutions are available when you need the services provided by a 
computer, such as word processing, gaming, and other types of applications. Here are these 
solutions, listed in order of cheapest (possibly even free) to most expensive:
s 5PGRADE OR REPURPOSE AN EXISTING ONE
s "UILD ONE
s "UY ONE
By using the free software covered in this book, not only will your computer’s useful life 
span increase, but your overall costs to buy (and then operate) are going to decrease. Need 
proof? Keep reading.
Upgrade or Repurpose an Existing PC
Saving money, reducing waste in landfills (a huge problem these days), and recycling materials 
are just a few of the benefits of taking an “obsolete” PC and making it useful again. Most com-
puters aren’t actually obsolete—they’re simply labeled obsolete because they cannot run the 
latest and greatest software being sold on store shelves. 
For many computer users, having the fastest video card, the largest hard drive, and the 
highest capacity memory chips on the market just isn’t necessary. My parents, for example, do 
three things with their computer: word processing, e-mail, and Internet browsing. They don’t 
watch DVDs, play graphic-intensive video games, or listen to music/MP3 files. But computer 
companies spend a fortune on advertising to convince potential customers that they abso-
lutely must have this new computer with a 4GHz processor, 512MB video card, 800GB SATA 
HARD DRIVE AND SIX 53"  PORTS IN ORDER TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND TO KEEP UP WITH THE REST OF THE
Internet-connected, high-speed world. But it’s all hype! The truth is that extending the life of 
a PC typically requires only a single upgrade, or two at the most. 
5PGRADING YOUR 0# MEANS BUYING ONLY HARDWARE THAT YOU NEED AND LEAVING THE REST ALONE
If you have run out of hard drive space and cannot find any files to delete, then buy and install 
a new hard drive. If your applications are sluggish, buy some more memory sticks and install 
them. If you’re truly trying to keep costs down, upgrading is your best bang for the buck. 
Repurposing can mean anything from formatting your hard drive and reinstalling the 
operating system to simply uninstalling any applications you are not using and freeing up 
resources for those apps that you do use. Some companies will sell or auction off their surplus 
computers to employees to use as home PCs. This is also an example of repurposing a PC and 
giving it a new life. And if you’re feeling brave and willing to do a little research on the Web, 
an old PC can make a great little home server. (A home server is simply a computer dedicated 
to holding music, pictures, and video and making them available to other computers in your 
home.)
You are certain to discover that upgrading a hard drive or adding an extra gigabyte of 
random-access memory (RAM) may be all that’s necessary to give a PC an extra year or two of 
life. It’s the dirty, little secret that most computer salespeople will never share with you!

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT

Build a PC
There are many reasons to build your own PC. Being able to choose the exact components 
you want or learning more about how computers work are two great examples. While it’s typi-
cally cheaper to do it yourself (DIY), this approach also has plenty of risks, which I’ll cover in a 
moment.
Let’s define DIY first, though. When I say DIY, I’m not talking about going to the Dell web 
site, selecting a base model, and then tweaking it with custom hardware additions. That may 
feel DIY, but it’s not.
What I mean by DIY is performing some research (that includes your computing needs), 
and then shopping for and purchasing the individual components that will go into your new 
PC. You might buy the components from a local store or over the Internet. The DIY comes 
when you take all these components (motherboard, memory chips, hard drive, video card, and 
power supply, for example), put them together, and install an operating system. That’s DIY.
NTip There are plenty of books available on building your own PC, but this book isn’t one of them. Later 
in the chapter, I’ll show you how to figure out what you need. If you need technical help on putting together 
a PC (trust me, it’s not difficult—I’ve built dozens!), I suggest three free online tutorials for instructions and 
discussion on the DIY PC: dppl6++sss*l_ia_d*_ki+^ukl_+, dppl6++sss*dkspkcaag*_ki+dkspk+
pda)caag)^hkc+^qeh`ejc)])jas)_kilqpan)l]np)-)_dkkoejc)d]n`s]na+, and dppl6++pa_dnalknp*
_ki+]npe_hao*t+-/23-.
If you’ve done your research and are buying components individually, you’re going to 
save money (web sites such as lne_as]p_d*_ki, ohe_g`a]ho*jap, and jasacc*_ki are great 
places to start looking for good deals). You won’t be nervous about purchasing “older” hard-
ware, because you know that older could mean last month’s processor or last year’s hard drive 
capacity. 
With many shops (online or not), you’ll often find that haggling can lower prices, espe-
cially if you can point them to a competitor who is selling the same item at the same price. 
And you’ll also be getting hardware with warranties. 
NNote While I’m not in favor of purchasing hardware from places such as _n]ecoheop*knc, if you’re 
comfortable doing so and don’t mind the buyer-beware risk built into these types of purchases, you can find 
great deals on hardware. You may be able to make a purchase from one of those PC owners who must have 
the latest and greatest, and are always ripping components out of their PCs to replace them with the new 
stuff. Just remember to keep “buyer beware” in your thoughts. Ask questions, and request a photo of the 
part number or serial number, so you can do a product search and verify that what you’re buying is what the 
seller is advertising. 

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
12
While you won’t save as much money on a DIY PC as you would performing an upgrade 
on an existing PC, you’ll still find the savings substantial when compared to the cost of buying 
a prebuilt PC.
Buy a PC
I recognize that many people like the idea of a new computer (but there is no such thing as a 
new-PC smell). One or two big boxes are delivered to your door, and you get to rip into them 
like it’s your birthday. Everything is shiny and under warranty. You turn it on, and maybe 
take a tour of the operating system, connect the speakers, examine the hard drive, and see all 
that unused space. Perhaps you’ll register a few preinstalled applications online so you can 
open them and starting typing, playing, or listening. New computers are definitely enjoyable. 
They’re easy to set up and ready to start using.
I’m not going to bash prebuilt computer sellers. They provide a service that’s obviously in 
demand. Not everyone feels comfortable assembling their own PC, and not everyone has an 
old PC sitting around waiting to be upgraded. PC sellers definitely give you a nice product for 
the price.
But even when you’re buying a new prebuilt PC, there are still ways to save money. You 
just need to exert some self-control and maybe do a little research to understand what you’re 
buying (or not buying).
First, be aware that most prebuilt PC sellers get you in the door (or on their web site) by 
offering a low-cost base unit. This unit typically doesn’t come with an LCD panel (or moni-
tor) and, in some instances, an operating system isn’t even installed. Check the fine print and 
know what you’re buying. 
NTip Check the Internet for online coupons, too. PC sellers frequently offer sizable discounts on their com-
puters. Sites such as ohe_g`a]ho*jap are a great place to find online coupons for 20% to 40% off! You 
simply type in the coupon code at checkout, and the price is adjusted. 
Next, most sellers allow you to perform “upgrades” to the base unit by checking boxes 
next to add-ons or swapping out lower-priced (and lower-performance) components for 
higher-end hardware. Again, this is where you must show some control and rely on your 
research on prices and features. Is the 250GB hard drive in the base unit enough, or should 
you spend the extra $50 to have it replaced with a 500GB hard drive? Here’s a hint: obtain 
prices for the two components individually, and if the “upgrade” costs more than the dif-
ference between the two, you’ll know it’s a bad deal. In this example, the price difference 
between a 250GB and 500GB hard drive is less than $20 on lne_as]p_d*_ki—no deal!
What you’ll discover is that by the time you’re finished reconfiguring the base unit with 
the hardware that you want, the price will most likely have jumped anywhere from 25% to 
100%! And that’s just with hardware upgrades. How about the software?
Most base units come with a base operating system, such as Windows Vista Home Basic, 
not Vista Home Premium—again, check the fine print! You’ll then be given the opportunity 
to upgrade the operating system to a more advanced version of Vista. (Windows XP versions 
included Home, Pro, and Media Center but, unfortunately, will not be sold after January 2009,

and support for the operating system will supposedly stop in October 2009. So, your choice of 
a Microsoft operating system will be confined to Vista Home Basic, Home Premium, Business,

the level of operating system that you need.
NNote If you want to really show off, consider removing the operating system altogether and installing a 
free one, such as Ubuntu Linux. Most of the software covered in this book will run on Ubuntu, and if you’re 
repurposing an old PC, you’ll truly have a free computer, since the hardware has already been paid for. That 
means free hardware, free operating system, and free software! One of the best books on installing and 
using Ubuntu is Beginning Ubuntu Linux, Third Edition by Keir Thomas and Jaime Sicam (Apress, 2008). 
I’ve read the book, and it is, hands-down, one of the best Ubuntu books on the market.
Finally, while configuring the base unit, you’ll be given the chance to add preinstalled 
applications, such as word processing, spreadsheet, antivirus, and photo/video editing soft-
ware. You can always purchase this software separately from a local computer store or on the 
Internet, but PC sellers often give you a slight price break if you buy the software from them. 
But ask yourself, “Are these applications I really need, or are there free alternatives?” (By the 
time you finish reading this book, you’ll have the answer.)
It’s so easy to just check off boxes next to software. When buying a prebuilt PC and con-
figuring its software, buyers can get click-happy and configure the “ultimate PC.” Fortunately, 
at the end of the configuration process, you’re presented with the final price of your newly 
configured computer. Once you’re over the sticker shock, you can go back and reconfigure, 
removing an item here and an application there, until you arrive at a balance of hardware, 
SOFTWARE AND PRICE THAT YOU CAN HANDLE 5NFORTUNATELY GETTING TO AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE SOME-
times requires that you remove an application that you feel is important for the work you need 
to do (or games you wish to play). But remember that any time you save money on software, 
you have choices. Let me explain.
Great News: Free Software Means More Hardware
Let’s not forget the purpose of this book: free software. That will often mean more money 
to apply to hardware—not just in terms of more components, but also in terms of higher 
performance. When you save $100 by loading a free application versus the off-the-shelf 
software, that money can be directly applied to the hardware in your computer—whether 
you’re upgrading, building a DIY, or buying a prebuilt new PC. Consider what an extra 
$100 (or $300 or $400) saved on software can buy when it comes to a processor, hard drive, 
or other components: faster speeds, more features, higher capacities, and, ultimately, a 
longer, more useful life for your PC.
Throughout the remaining chapters, I’ll cover brand-name applications that cost any-
where from $30 to $40, all the way up to $500 or more. Keep these prices in mind as you decide 
whether you absolutely require the brand-name software, can substitute the free competi-
tor, or don’t need that type of application at all. It adds up quickly. By the time you finish this 
book, you may be surprised that you’ve substituted $300, $400, or maybe even $500 worth 
of name-brand software with free software options. Pocket those savings, or splurge on that

Five PC User Types
Whether you’re considering building your own PC or buying a prebuilt one, I highly recom-
mend that you first examine your computer needs. Why? Because if you can identify the type 
of software you will run on your computer, you can spend the appropriate amounts on the 
hardware that you need, and spend less on the hardware that you don’t need.
There’s really no surefire method for doing this, so I’ll just offer one possible solution that 
divides computer users into what I call user types. For simplicity, I categorize all computer 
users into five types:
Type 1, Bare-Bones: The Bare-Bones PC user requires the most basic of computing 
needs: e-mail, word processing, basic graphics and sound, and antivirus protection. 
This user may or may not be comfortable with computers, but does live in the twenty-
first century and recognizes that Internet connectivity makes life easier, so will want 
either dial-up or broadband service. This user is likely concerned about cost, so basic 
hardware, without any bells and whistles, is fine (and because this computer may be 
upgraded at a later time).
Type 2, Family Member: The PC will be used and shared by all members of a household. 
High-speed Internet is a necessity, as is e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, and 
GOOD SPEAKERS AND VIDEO DISPLAY CAPABILITIES FOR MUSIC MOVIES AND GAMES 5PGRADING
is always an option, so this computer doesn’t necessarily need the most advanced hard-
ware. Price is important, but so is performance. The Family Member PC user is willing 
to play a game of give-and-take to get the best balance of price and performance. And 
because so many people will be using this PC for a variety of reasons, antivirus software 
is an absolute requirement.
Type 3, Gamer: The Gamer requires the best of all possible hardware, including video, 
sound, processor, memory, and storage. This user never knows what game he will be 
running next, so it’s safest to have the latest and greatest hardware installed, or at least 
have a computer that can be readily upgraded to the newest stuff. The Gamer is more 
concerned with performance than cost, so sticker shock isn’t a concern when select-
ing components. Components should be easy to swap out (as well as a case that allows 
quick changes), because this user is never happy with last month’s hardware.
Type 4, Multimedia Guru: The Multimedia Guru works with video, audio, and photo-
graphs and requires the best visual experience possible, as well as fast hard drive access 
and superb sound quality. Multimedia takes up a huge amount of space, so storage is 
always a concern. A large LCD is almost always present, and no rinky-dink video card 
will suffice. The Guru may also dabble in music mixing and editing, so a quality sound 
card is an absolute must-have. Cost may be a factor, but the Guru knows that you get 
what you pay for and will settle for trade-offs, as long as they don’t affect the applica-
tions she runs.

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
15
Type 5, Small Business Owner: The Small Business Owner must carefully balance cost with 
functionality. This user is looking for the best price for the best hardware, and is usually 
willing to shop around for the best deal. The software installed on a small business com-
puter typically includes productivity applications (word processor, spreadsheet, and so 
on), as well as antivirus and data backup software. Video can sometimes be important, 
but sound quality is an easy sacrifice for most Small Business Owner users. The small 
business PC typically has a mix of good-quality hardware, but not necessarily the most 
recent or best.
The user types aren’t super-specific. You may be having a hard time deciding which type 
you fall under, but that’s okay. These are merely to help demonstrate how pricing can vary 
depending on your hardware and software needs. Keep these five types in mind as we take a 
virtual shopping trip to first look at prebuilt PCs, and then at the hardware required to build 
AN IDENTICAL OR AS CLOSE TO IDENTICAL AS POSSIBLE	 $)9 COMPUTER 5LTIMATELY YOULL FALL INTO YOUR
own unique type—let’s call it Type <Your Name Here>—because you’ll be the one customizing 
your new computer. 
Two Steps to Identifying Your Hardware Needs
Now I’m going to show you a two-step process to identify the type of hardware you need. You 
should perform these steps no matter what type of PC you plan on purchasing. As an example, 
I’ll demonstrate how to pick a Bare-Bones PC. In the next section, we’ll look at PC shopping for 
the other four types.
NCaution Keep in mind that the only software you’re receiving with the name-brand computers is the 
operating system (Windows Vista) and, in a few instances, Outlook Express, Microsoft Works, and 30-day 
evaluation copies of various applications. Don’t be fooled—Microsoft Works is not the same as Microsoft 
Office, so you’re not getting Word, Excel, or Outlook. And 30-day evaluations are just that: trial software that 
will stop working in 30 days and require you to purchase if you wish to continue using them. As you read 
through the remaining chapters in this book, you’ll find the additional pricing required for various applica-
tions. Software can often double or even triple the cost of a computer.
Step 1: Find a Prebuilt PC
Your first step in our virtual shopping trip is to find a prebuilt PC that will fit your needs. For 
now, I’m searching for a good Type 1, Bare-Bones PC. Remember that the Bare-Bones user is 
looking to save money and needs only enough hardware to run the most basic of applications, 
such as an e-mail app and Internet browser. There’s no need to buy the largest hard drive or 
the fastest processor, so I’ll keep this in mind as I browse for a PC.
I’m paying a visit to `ahh*_ki. For a Type 1, Bare-Bones PC, I’ve located the Inspiron 530s 
base unit, which has a starting price of $279 (plus any tax and shipping).

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT

Inspiron 530s
Intel Celeron 440 processor (2.00GHz, 800 FSB)
Windows Vista Home Basic Service Pack 1
No monitor
16X DVD+/-RW drive
1GB dual-channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz, 2 DIMMs
250GB serial ATA hard drive (7200 RPM)
Integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3100
Integrated 7.1 Channel Audio (sound)
One-year limited hardware warranty (not on-site service, so you’ll send it in for repairs)
While I’ve now identified a very basic computer that could satisfy a Bare-Bones PC user’s 
hardware requirements, I’d like to make a few changes.
First, I want to upgrade that Celeron processor to a dual-core processor. That will be the 
most expensive hardware upgrade, but the processor is just too important to skimp on. Next, I 
need a monitor. Dell will let me add a 17-inch widescreen LCD for $180. 
Figure 2-1 shows the system summary. Note that the computer comes with a network card 
(10/100 Ethernet) built in to the motherboard, keyboard, and mouse, and a 30-day evaluation 
copy of McAfee security software (antivirus, anti-spyware). It does not come with speakers or a 
floppy drive (which is really old technology anyway, so don’t let that bother you). Finally, Dell 
throws in a copy of Microsoft Works.
Figure 2-1. The Dell Bare-Bones system choice (with an upgraded processor and monitor added)

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
17
As shown in Figure 2-2, after upgrading the processor and adding the monitor, shipping 
($35.00), and tax ($38.04), my total price is now $672.04. That’s not too bad for a basic PC that 
should give me years of service when I combine it with the free software covered in this book! 
Now that I’ve picked the Type 1, Bare-Bones computer I’m considering purchasing, it’s time 
for step 2.
NCaution As you move through the checkout process, notice how many other products and accessories 
Dell asks you to consider purchasing: printer, wireless mouse, mouse pad, flash drive, and even a digital 
photo frame! Just stay focused, and buy only what you need. That means the computer . . . the computer . . . 
the computer—stay focused!

Step 2: Obtain Prices for Individual Components
The second step in the process can be performed using information from a web site such 
as lne_as]p_d*_ki, or by simply visiting your local PC store and doing some price checks. 
The following list shows prices that I obtained from a local PC store in Atlanta, Georgia. In 
some cases, I couldn’t find the exact matching component as the Dell Inspiron 530s. In those 
situations, I priced a component that would be considered a step or two higher in speed, per-
formance, capacity, or all three.

probably prefer to order the name-brand Dell.
But wait just a minute. Let me tell you what else happened during my visit to the local 
PC shop. I printed out the components for my Dell choice and showed them to the com-
puter technicians. After a few minutes of discussion, they agreed to build me the following 
computer:

For almost $50 less, I get the original Inspiron 530s hardware configuration, but with a 
faster DVD burner and larger LCD (20-inch), and no shipping costs. The larger LCD will be 
great on my eyes, and that $50 I saved will buy an additional 2GB DDR2 SDRAM (memory).

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
19
I didn’t have to haggle (but I’m sure I could have gotten a little better deal if I had pushed). 
I simply showed them what I was willing to spend on a Dell PC, and they provided me with a 
better computer at a lower price. Even if I had elected to buy the components myself and put 
the PC together, I would have saved a few dollars. For a Type 1 computer, however, savings 
of between $30 and $100 should be your goal. And remember that the money you save can 
immediately be applied to purchasing better hardware—maybe more memory, a faster pro-
cessor, or more hard drive capacity.
You can save even more money when you begin investigating purchasing your own 
Type 2, 3, 4, and 5 PC and components versus buying prebuilt PCs. 
Hardware Focus by User Type
In the previous section, I gave you an idea of how to price a computer for a Type 1, Bare-Bones 
user. Here, I’ll note the hardware that you should focus on when pricing a computer of the 
remaining four user types. I’ll provide an example of a PC for each type, and point out where 
you should spend your money.
Type 2, Family Member’s PC
A good PC for a family has a little of everything. Sound, video, and storage are just as important 
(and not just to the kids’ games) as a decent processor and a healthy amount of RAM. A good 
example of a computer of this type is the HP a6560t (dppl6++sss*dl*_ki).
HP a6560t 
Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E8400 (3.0GHz)
Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 1
20-inch widescreen LCD
128MB NVIDIA GeForce 9300
16X DVD+/-RW drive
2GB dual-channel DDR2 SDRAM at 800MHz
320GB serial ATA hard drive (7200 RPM)
Sound Blaster X-Fi
Standard HP speakers and keyboard/mouse
One-year limited hardware warranty
Total price: $975.16 (includes free shipping and $55.18 tax)
A 320GB hard drive is more than enough (for now) to satisfy the storage needs of most 
families, and 2GB of RAM will guarantee that Windows Vista runs properly. While the video 
card isn’t the best on the market, 128MB will satisfy any game players in the house, as well as 
make Internet browsing easier on the eyes. Add a nice sound card, some speakers, and a DVD 
burner so users can back up their photos and listen to their music, and this PC is a perfect little 
solution for the Family Member user.

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
20
NTip When considering the purchase of a Family Member’s PC, focus on storage (hard drive), memory 
(RAM), and the processor. Video and sound are frequently included on the motherboard, and require no addi-
tional purchase of special hardware. Try to get the best (longest) warranty you can, too. Having more users 
means more wear and tear on a computer, and a good warranty can protect your investment.
Type 3, Gamer’s PC
The Gamer’s PC focuses on performance in four areas: video, sound, memory, and pro-
cessing speed. Secondary concerns are usually storage, but gamers will frequently buy 
low-end hard drives to get the higher storage capacity; if a hard drive dies, they just 
replace it and keep on playing.
A typical Gamer’s PC will put the money into the processor, a lot of RAM, a super-fast 
video card, and a high-quality sound card. If a sacrifice must be made, most gamers will go 
with a lower-priced sound card first, and then maybe a little less processor speed, before 
they’ll skimp on RAM or the video card. Keeping that in mind, Alienware (dppl6++sss*
]heajs]na*_ki) has created what has to be one of the most impressive (at least, for now) 
PCs for playing games: the Area-51 High-Performance Gaming PC (see Figure 2-3).
Alienware Area-51 High-Performance Gaming PC
Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 Processor (2.66GHz, 1333MHz FSB)
Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 1
22-inch widescreen LCD
512MB ATI Radeon 4870
20X DVD+/-RW drive (SATA)
2GB dual-channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1066MHz
1TB serial ATA hard drive (7200 RPM)
Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer 
Gigabit Ethernet port
Keyboard/mouse
One-year limited hardware warranty
Total price: $2916.53 (includes $124.00 shipping and $165.00 tax)
As you can see, this PC doesn’t skimp on the hardware. It includes top-of-the-line sound 
and video, plenty of RAM, a 1 terabyte (TB) hard drive, and a 22-inch widescreen monitor. 
Again, when pricing a Gamer’s PC, remember the big four: video, sound, memory, and pro-
cessing speed. Focus your spending there, and you’ll find the latest and greatest games run 
with no problem.

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
21
Figure 2-3. Almost $3,000 for a computer, and a picture to prove it
NTip Yes, that’s $3,000 for a computer. But this is the Gamer’s PC, remember? Price is no option. Well, 
okay, maybe you consider yourself a Gamer but can’t imagine paying $3,000 for a computer. In that case, 
remember the concept of trade-offs. Do you really need the fastest processor, fastest RAM, highest capacity 
hard drive, and newest video card? Savings can be found by just taking one or two “steps” back in hardware 
level. You’ll still end up with a speed-demon gaming PC. You’ll be surprised at how much a video card or 
sound card drops in price once the latest version is released by a manufacturer, and you can take advantage 
of this. Research the latest hardware releases, and then just pull back a little (not much) and buy something 
in the ballpark. A Gamer’s PC is always going to be a little higher in cost, but that’s the price for wanting to 
play those high-performance games.
Type 4, Multimedia Guru’s PC
The Multimedia Guru is all about videos, photos, and music. This user’s PC is focused on 
providing the best video and sound possible, allowing the viewer to appreciate every color and 
sound at the best possible quality. This means that hardware usually focuses on the video and 
sound cards, as well as the hard drives. While viewing and listening are important, the ability 
to edit (both sound and video) is also paramount, so this PC requires a lot of storage space and 
fast spinning hard drives to supply the video and sound to the screen. A typical PC for this type 

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
22
of user might include the Gateway LX series (dppl6++sss*c]pas]u*_ki), designed specifically 
for the multimedia fan.
Gateway LX 6200
AMD Phenom X4 9500 Quad Processor (2.2GHz, 3600MHz FSB)
Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 1
Built-in TV tuner (for watching and recording TV from your computer)
15-in-1 media card reader (because the Multimedia Guru uses them all)
256MB ATI Radeon 3200
18X DVD+/-RW drive (SATA)
8GB dual-channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1066MHz
750GB serial ATA hard drive (7200 RPM)
8-channel Dolby surround-sound card
Gigabit Ethernet port
Keyboard/mouse
One-year limited hardware warranty
Total price: $857.99 (includes $29.00 shipping and about $48.00 tax)
It’s an impressive PC, but before you get excited about the price, let me point out that this 
PC does not come with an LCD monitor. This is a good thing—as a Multimedia Guru, I would 
much prefer to pick the size and quality of my LCD panel myself, and not have that decision 
made for me. So I need to budget between $200 and $500 for a good-quality, large viewing area 
LCD screen. But for less than $1,400, a Multimedia Guru will find this PC can easily handle 
viewing, editing, and storing every photo, song, and video.
NTip The Multimedia Guru’s PC could easily double as a Gamer’s PC with that large amount of RAM and 
sizable hard drive and fast processor. The video card ideally should have 512MB, and the sound is built into 
the motherboard (rather than being a separately installed sound card). A true Gamer might balk a little, but 
it’s more than enough for the Multimedia Guru. So, if this is your type of PC, remember to focus on storage 
(hard drive size and a lot of space), memory (for handling the sound and video sent to and from the hard 
drive), and the video card (no less than 256MB). Feel free to skimp a little on the sound card and DVD burner. 
You don’t really need the fastest burner, and the most crystal-clear sound card isn’t necessary, unless you’re 
in the music production industry.
Type 5, Small Business Owner’s PC
Small business owners have a variety of items to consider when it comes to a PC. It can be dif-
ficult to nail down exactly what hardware is important and what isn’t. Some small business 

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
23
owners use their PC strictly for writing letters, managing spreadsheets, and e-mail—all tasks 
that can be handled with standard productivity software. Other business owners run special-
ized software that is specific to their industry, such as advanced accounting software for CPAs 
or medical record keeping software for doctors’ offices.
The best advice I can offer is to examine the minimum and suggested hardware require-
ments that come with all of the software you plan on using. Most software will detail the 
minimum specifications and suggested specifications for how much hard drive space is 
required, how much memory is needed, and if any special hardware is required (such as a 
scanner or DVD/CD burner). I recommend purchasing a PC that includes the highest sug-
gested hardware requirements for your software (replace suggested with ideal, and you’ll 
get a better idea of what the software manufacturer actually means). If your word process-
ing software states it requires a minimum of 512MB of RAM, and your accounting software 
requires a minimum of 1GB of RAM, you know you must go with the higher value. But if the 
accounting software “suggests” an amount of 2GB, then you need to determine if the cost of 
the added hardware (memory) is within your budget.
An example of a typical small business PC that you might find for sale is the Dell Vostro 
(dppl6++sss*`ahh*_ki) business series.
Dell Vostro 420
Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Processor (2.40GHz, 8M, L2Cache, 1066FSB) 
Windows Vista Business with Service Pack 1
20-inch widescreen LCD
256MB ATI Radeon 3450 video card
16X DVD+/-RW drive (SATA)
3GB dual-channel DDR2 SDRAM at 800MHz
500GB serial ATA hard drive (7200 RPM)
Integrated 5.1 sound (on motherboard)
Gigabit Ethernet port
Keyboard/mouse
Three-year on-site, next-business-day warranty
Total price: $1437.00 (includes $81.00 tax and free shipping)
This is a great PC for a small business owner. It has plenty of hard drive space, RAM, and 
a fast processor. And notice that three-year on-site service warranty. Dell sends a technician to 
your office the next business day. (I’ve used this feature and can verify that Dell’s on-site ser-
vice is the best in the industry.)
Where does this PC skimp? Well, the DVD burner isn’t the fastest available, and although 
the video card is nice (256MB), it has on-board sound (on the motherboard), rather than a 
sound card. The 20-inch LCD screen is nice, too, but business owners often have a multitude 
of applications running at the same time, so a larger screen might be better, but it costs more. 

CHAPTER 2 N  THE PC ELEMENT
24
NTip All in all, a small business owner should never go bare bones. A simple computer just isn’t going 
to be able to handle the demands of high-end business software. Likewise, there’s no reason for a small 
business owner to load up a new computer with the highest quality of computer hardware. Leave that to 
the Gamer. You have a business to run and costs to watch. Stick with a decent-sized hard drive, load up as 
much RAM as you can afford, select a reasonable processor, and you’re (pardon the pun) in business.
Summary
You’ve absorbed a lot of information in this chapter, so I’m going to keep this summary short 
and sweet. I’ll offer you a list of things to keep in mind as you upgrade/repurpose an older 
computer, build a custom PC, or buy a prebuilt one:
s +EEP YOUR EXISTING 0# AND UPGRADE ITS HARDWARE TO SAVE MONEY
s )F YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST GET A NEW 0# IDENTIFY THE SOFTWARE YOU NEED TO HELP YOU DETER-
mine the hardware to purchase with a new computer.
s )DENTIFY THE BRANDNAME SOFTWARE THAT YOU WANT TO USE AND ADD THE PRICES INTO YOUR
calculations for a new PC.
s #OMPARE PRICES OF PREBUILT COMPUTERS WITH THE COST TO BUILD IT YOURSELF
s )F YOURE WILLING TO SUBSTITUTE FREE SOFTWARE CONSIDER USING THE MONEY SAVED TO UPGRADE
the hardware.
s .EVER BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR A BETTER PRICE FROM A LOCAL COMPUTER SHOP 3HOW THEM EXACTLY
what you want to buy from a competitor.
s !CCEPT THE FACT THAT HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES QUICKLY AND DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP
of believing you must have the best, fastest, and shiniest products under the hood of 
your PC.
In a nutshell, save money on software when and where you can, and pump that money 
back into your hardware, business, or hobby.
That’s it, really. Computers change so quickly, there’s no reason to get upset when you 
find that your video card is considered “obsolete” at the computer store and no longer sold. 
Don’t get angry when that $200 you spent on a 1TB hard drive three months ago will now buy 
you 2TB. And don’t yell at your computer when its video card sputters and lags a bit when 
you’re playing that new game. Instead, reflect back on the money you saved on the software 
installed on your computer. And when the time comes, upgrade the hardware and smile, 
knowing that your computer has many more years of usefulness left in it.

Word Processing
Your new computer has an operating system installed, and you can play a card game or two 
and browse the Internet. Now it’s time to start loading up your new machine with some great 
free software. That’s what I’m going to show you how to do in this book. We’ll start our dis-
cussion of free, alternative software solutions with one of the most common activities: word 
processing.
Grade school children, college students, business professionals, retirees, and everyone 
in between have most likely used a computer to write a letter, and I’m sure you have, too. 
You might run into the occasional individual who uses only a typewriter or paper notepad, 
but common practice in today’s world is to use word processing software. In fact, chances 
are, word processing is most of what you’ll do with your computer. According to a 2003 sur-
vey of United States workplaces (dppl6++sss*^ho*ckr+jaso*naha]oa+Deopknu+_eq]s*ptp), 
word processing ranked behind only Internet browsing and e-mail as the most widespread 
computer activity.
So, it’s no surprise that plenty of word processing products are vying for your attention 
and your dollars. I’ve used close to a dozen different word processors over the years, and 
I can’t make up my mind which one I like the most (but the two that I recommend in this 
chapter come close to being at the top of the list). One thing is for certain, however, and that 
is the biggest name today in word processing is Microsoft Word. It comes installed on many 
new computers (bundled with other Microsoft products such as Excel and PowerPoint) and 
is considered by many to be the gold standard for word processing applications (but opin-
ions do vary). It also comes with a gold standard price.
I use Microsoft Word—it’s a great product. There’s simply no escaping it in my line of 
work. But I sure don’t like having to pay through the nose every few years to get the latest 
upgrade. So, I keep my eyes open for alternatives, and so should you. In this chapter, I’ll cover 
two of my favorite alternatives to Word. Both of them are 100% free, and their full complement 
of features may surprise you.
The Defender
Microsoft Word is widely considered to be the standard for word processing applications. With 
more than ten years of development and version releases, Word continues to beat out many 
competitors, including Corel WordPerfect and Lotus Symphony Documents. The most current 
version, Microsoft Word 2007, comes bundled in the Microsoft Office software suite.

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING

NNote The previous version, Microsoft Word 2003, is still extremely popular with users. The user interface 
changed drastically between 2003 and 2007 versions of Word. Microsoft replaced the standard toolbars with 
a new interface called the Ribbon. Opinions vary on the Ribbon; some like it. I don’t. Thus, my search for 
alternatives began.
MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE
The Microsoft Office suite is a grouping of productivity applications. Combinations depend on the version of 
Office you purchase and may include any or all of the following:
s 7ORD A WORD PROCESSING APPLICATION
s %XCEL A SPREADSHEET APPLICATION COVERED IN #HAPTER 	
s 0OWER0OINT AN APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE SLIDE SHOW PRESENTATIONS COVERED IN #HAPTER 	
s /UTLOOK AN EMAIL CALENDAR AND ADDRESS BOOK APPLICATION COVERED IN #HAPTER 	
s !CCESS AN APPLICATION FOR CREATING INFORMATION DATABASES
When you first open Microsoft Word, the graphical user interface (GUI) provides you with 
a blank page and a handful of buttons and menus along the top of the screen. It can take some 
time to learn the locations for different tools and options, but the most common needs of a 
user—such as underlining or boldfacing text, setting margins, and changing the font or font 
size—are all easy to locate. 
Microsoft does a good job (some might say too good) of hiding many of the power fea-
tures that most users won’t be needing, while providing the most commonly used features in 
plain sight. For example, Figure 3-1 shows a document with the reviewing options displayed at 
the top of the screen. Every now and then, I need to go on the hunt: click menu A, click tab B, 
click button C, click drop-down menu D . . . you get the picture. Unfortunately, it’s a fact of life 
when dealing with powerful applications: software developers are limited to how many but-
tons and features they can put on the screen and must hide/bury everything else. (Yet another 
reason for downloading and installing a simpler, more streamlined application.) 
One important item you should be aware of regarding Microsoft Word is the file for-
mat it uses: *`k_. The *`k_ format is more common today than the original text file type 
developed decades ago: *ptp. You’ll come across many documents these days saved using 
the *`k_ format, simply because Microsoft Word is found on so many computers (both 
Macintosh and Windows versions are available). Any word processing application that you 
consider using should be capable of opening and saving files with the *`k_ file extension. 
But there’s a new twist.

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING
27
Figure 3-1. Editing a standard business letter using tools found in Microsoft Word 2007
NNote When you hear the term file type, don’t cringe. It simply refers to how an application stores a file. 
-OST OPERATING SYSTEMS 7INDOWS INCLUDED	 ALLOW THE USER TO SIMPLY DOUBLECLICK A FILE TO OPEN IT "UT HOW
does the operating system know which application to use for a specific file? Say you have a mixture of files 
on your computer, including word processing, spreadsheet, graphics, and music. How does Windows know 
WHEN YOU DOUBLECLICK Dau[Fq`a*il/ to open your music player instead of your spreadsheet application? 
7INDOWS SIMPLY LOOKS AT THE FILE TYPE il/ IN THIS EXAMPLE	 AND OPENS THE APPROPRIATE APPLICATION THAT YOU
INSTALLED OR WAS PREINSTALLED	
Microsoft Word 2007 uses a new file type: *`k_t. That additional t thrown in there means 
that Word saves your file using XML code. I really don’t want to get into a discussion of XML 
here. The bare minimum you should be aware of is that adding in the XML code does give 
word processing documents more flexibility when making them available on the Internet, 

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING
28
but the price comes with bloated file sizes and sometimes slower performance (such as when 
saving and opening a document). Results vary from computer to computer, but at least Word 
2007 allows you to save using the old reliable *`k_ file format. Keep that in mind when send-
ing your word processing documents to coworkers and friends. If they don’t have the ability to 
open *`k_t files, you’ll hear from them for sure. To avoid problems, try to remember to save 
word processing documents using the *`k_ file type. Then you can be reasonably sure that 
others will be able to open, view, and/or edit your documents.
I think Microsoft Word is a good application, and it definitely delivers on word process-
ing features. I’ve selected Word in the past simply because of its variety of built-in tools. 
These include grammar and spell checking, mail merge capabilities, and too many format-
ting choices to remember—font, font size, bold, italics, bullets, columns, tables, and so 
on. I hear just as many people complain that Word has too many features as the number 
of people who complain it needs more. But for many professionals (myself included), the 
investment in time (learning/training) and money makes Word a difficult application to 
give up.
NNote ! COMPLETE LIST OF THE FEATURES IN THE LATEST VERSION OF -ICROSOFT 7ORD CAN BE FOUND AT dppl6++sss*
ie_nkokbp*_ki+skn` "E AWARE THAT YOU COULD SPEND HOURS SIFTING THROUGH THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION THAT
Microsoft provides. This information also demonstrates the complexity of Microsoft Word and the number of 
features that are built in to this powerhouse application. 
But that doesn’t mean I’m not looking for the day when I can stop spending big bucks 
every two or three years to get the latest, greatest Word version. Rumor has it that Microsoft 
is now considering a subscription model for its Office suite. This means you’ll pay a yearly 
or monthly subscription fee, and get any updates and upgrades free during the subscription 
period. No thank you.
The good news is that many competitors are catching up to Microsoft Word. If you 
don’t necessarily need all the bells and whistles that Word offers, there are many free 
alternatives that are taking a bite out of Microsoft’s market share. And even if you do need 
those power features, competitors are constantly adding and upgrading their own prod-
ucts, ensuring that the day is coming when all the features you do need will be available. 
(You did catch the free part, right?) 
Two applications that I find myself using with more frequency include OpenOffice.org 
Writer and Google Docs Document. Read about them here, and then download and install 
them on your new low-cost computer. You may find yourself jumping (or is that writing?) 
on the free software bandwagon.
The Contenders
I’ll admit that it’s difficult to find an alternative to Microsoft Word that matches it feature-for-
feature and provides an identical user interface. But I’ve found one application that does come 
close: OpenOffice.org Writer. OpenOffice.org Writer has enough features to satisfy even the 
most demanding word processing power user.

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING
29
Another alternative is a member of the Google Docs family called Document. Google Docs 
Document doesn’t come close to offering all of Word’s features, but it’s extremely easy to use, 
comes with a clean, uncomplicated user interface, and provides the most common features 
that typical users are likely to require. I use it frequently for those quick-and-simple writing 
requirements. Document also has a great sharing feature that makes it really easy to allow 
others to view and edit your documents (more on that in the “Google Docs Document Fea-
tures” section later in this chapter).
OpenOffice.org Writer
OpenOffice.org Writer is the word processing application that is part of the OpenOffice.org 
software suite. Just as certain versions of Microsoft Office contain a word processor, spread-
sheet, slide show/presentation, and e-mail application, OpenOffice.org provides a similar 
collection.
OPENOFFICE.ORG SUITE
OpenOffice.org comes as a single downloadable file that allows you to choose from a list of software applica
tions to install on your computer. The latest version is 3.0. Some of the applications include the following:
s 7RITER A WORD PROCESSOR APPLICATION
s #ALC A SPREADSHEET APPLICATION SIMILAR TO -ICROSOFT %XCEL COVERED IN #HAPTER 	
s )MPRESS A PRESENTATIONSLIDE SHOW APPLICATION SIMILAR TO -ICROSOFT 0OWER0OINT COVERED IN #HAPTER 	
 
As shown in Figure 3-2, OpenOffice.org Writer has a simple user interface. As you can see, 
the number of toolbar buttons and menus is substantially less than what you’ll find in Micro-
soft Word. But don’t let that fool you—Writer is a powerful and feature-rich application.
After installing the software, you might consider selecting the Help ° OpenOffice Help 
menu option. A quick glance through the online help documentation will give you a good idea 
of the various things you can do with Writer. From the same Help menu, you can also choose 
the What’s This? option. When this feature is active, you can hover your mouse pointer over 
any button, and a small text box will pop up to let you know what it is and how it works. Click 
any open area of the screen to turn off the What’s This? feature.
Give yourself some time to become familiar with all the features that Writer offers. We’ll 
walk through a few sample tasks in the “OpenOffice.org Writer Features” section later in the 
chapter, but for now, just experiment a little. Type a short letter to a friend, and then try out 
some of the options such as boldfacing, changing the font, and modifying the margins. 

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING
30
Figure 3-2. OpenOffice.org Writer has an uncluttered and easy-to-use interface.
NNote Yes, I’m one of those people who play around with software before consulting the manual. With 
Writer, I found the user interface so similar to Word that it was several weeks before I needed to go to the 
help documentation—it was that easy and familiar to use. 
The basics of Writer are straightforward. You have a “what you see is what you get” 
(WYSIWYG) view of the document. You have menu options and buttons that can apply to the 
entire document or to a selection within the document. But if there’s a task you simply cannot 
figure out, start with the Help ° OpenOffice Help option. If that doesn’t provide a solution, 
your next step is the OpenOffice.org web site and its help forum, found at dppl6++oqllknp*
klajkbbe_a*knc. 
Unlike with Microsoft Word, you’ll find that the help community for OpenOffice.org, as 
with most other open source projects, is user-run and very responsive. You can sift through 
previous questions, post your own queries, and offer help to others who might be looking 
to do something that you’ve already figured out. I’ve posted many questions and received 
answers the same day, and even some within a few minutes. The number of OpenOffice.org 
users out there is growing, and those willing to provide support are always quick to help a 
newcomer.

The OpenOffice.org web site offers much more than a place to ask questions and get 
answers. The site provides additional downloads such as templates and clipart that can be 
used in Writer and the other OpenOffice.org applications. Just visit dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*

Google Docs Document
The next word processing application I’m anxious to introduce you to comes from a company 
you might be familiar with: Google. Google started out as a simple Internet search company in 
1998, but has since extended its reach into many other areas, including e-mail, online maps, 
scheduling/calendar tools, and word processing.
Google now offers its own software suite called Google Docs, which I absolutely love. 
While Google Docs doesn’t come close to providing all the features of Microsoft Office, it con-
tinues to surprise users by adding new tools and features regularly. And what’s the best part 
besides it being free? There is no software to install or updates to download. The software is 
maintained by Google, and all that’s required to use it is a live Internet connection. 
This is our first example of SaaS (Software as a Service, discussed in Chapter 1), where the 
normal functions of an application installed on your computer’s hard drive are instead used 
within your web browser. 
GOOGLE DOCS SUITE
The Google Docs collection of applications is maintained by Google and available using your Internet web 
browser. The following applications are currently available:

After you’ve created a Google account and logged in to Google Docs (see the “Where 
to Get the Software” section coming up next), you’ll find the user interface is similar to that 
shown in Figure 3-3.

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING

Figure 3-3. The Google Docs user interface is completely contained within a web browser.
To begin using Google Docs Document, simply click the New menu on the left side of 
the screen and choose Document from the drop-down list. Document opens, ready to use, as 
shown in Figure 3-4. Yes, it’s that easy.
As with OpenOffice.org Writer, Google Docs Document has an uncluttered toolbar (Word 
2007 Ribbon-haters may appreciate the simplicity) and is intuitive to use. We’ll walk through a 
few sample tasks using Google Docs Document later in the chapter, in the “Google Docs Docu-
ment Features” section, but in the event that you encounter a problem or are trying to figure 
out how to perform a specific task, select the Help ° Google Docs Help Center menu option. 
The online help section offers you the ability to search using keywords, as well as a listing of 
favorite topics to click to learn more. Finally, Google offers its users the ability to suggest new 
features for inclusion in future updates to Google Docs by clicking the “Let us know” link.

POTENTIAL USER GROUPS AND BENEFITS
While everyone can potentially benefit from free word processing software, I can think of three user groups 
that are most likely to gain the largest advantage by using OpenOffice.org Writer or Google Docs Document.

also simple to use. Not having to spend hours learning all the bells and whistles frees up time that is better spent 
enjoying retirement. My mom and dad are retired, and I was happy to be able to provide them with OpenOffice.
org and save them some serious cash. It’s got all the features they need, and it is easy to use to boot.

Where to Get the Software
In each chapter, I’ll provide you with a web address (URL) where you can find the software 
to download or use (in the case of SaaS). In most instances, installing software is as easy as 
double-clicking the downloaded installation file and following the instructions. In some chap-
ters, I may provide additional installation steps if the installation is tricky or has some unusual 
steps that you should know about. In this chapter, I’ll take you through the OpenOffice.org 
application installation process.
OpenOffice.org Writer
Here’s how to get Writer from the OpenOffice.org site:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*knc+.
 
2. Click “I want to download OpenOffice.org.” Then click the big, green Download Now! 
button and follow the instructions.
 
3. During the download, take note of the web page that opens. It contains links that allow 
you to provide feedback, ask questions, and volunteer to help further develop the 
product.
Once the OpenOffice.org download is complete, you’re ready to install and begin using 
Writer. Jump ahead to the “Notes on OpenOffice.org Installation” section to get started.
Google Docs Document
Follow these steps to get started with Google Docs Document: 
 
1. Visit dppl6++`k_o*ckkcha*_ki.
 
2. If you already have a Google account (for Gmail or another Google service), log in. 
Otherwise, click the Get Started button and follow the instructions to create your free 
user account.

dppl6++`k_o*ckkcha*_ki	 *UST CLICK THE 4AKE A 4OUR OR .EW &EATURES LINK to investigate Google Docs 
before you sign up.

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING
35
Once you log in to Google Docs, you might be surprised to find that there’s no software 
to install. As I’ve noted, Google Docs is this book’s first introduction to SaaS. Once you’re 
logged in, you’re ready to begin using Document (or any of the other Google Docs family of 
applications).
WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE?
You can choose to use either OpenOffice.org Writer or Google Docs Document, but if you’re wondering if I 
have a favorite, my answer is “depends.” With Document, remember that you’re keeping your files stored on 
Google’s hard drives, located somewhere other than on your own computer. The upside here is there’s no 
software to install and your hard drive won’t be filled up with application files. With Writer, however, you’ll 
need to install software on your computer, and any files you create are also stored on your hard drive. This 
may or may not matter to you. 
Ultimately, it comes down to taking a test drive. The easiest order would be to use Google Docs Docu
ment first, since it doesn’t require you to install any software. Use it and figure out if it fulfills your software 
needs. If it doesn’t, move on to OpenOffice.org Writer—download it, install it, and try it out. 
This advice works for pretty much all the software you’ll be introduced to in this book. Since the soft
ware is free, there’s very little risk to trying it before you consider spending any money on a commercial 
product.
Notes on OpenOffice.org Installation
I’m going to walk you through installing the OpenOffice.org software using a set of screen-
shots. (As noted, Google Docs Document does not require installation on your computer.) 
Software seems to always be in a state of change, so don’t stress if my images don’t match 
exactly what you’re seeing. And if you make an incorrect selection, you can always uninstall 
the application or simply click the Back buttons to start over. 
We’ll go through the steps to install Writer. You’ll also be given the chance to install Calc, 
the OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application covered in Chapter 4, and Impress, OpenOffice.
org’s presentation application covered in Chapter 5.
 
1. After you download the OpenOffice.org 3.0 installation file, double-click the icon. You 
will be informed that a temporary folder will be created to unpack the installation files, 
as shown in Figure 3-5. Click the Next button.
 
2. Click the Unpack button. Once the files are unpacked, OpenOffice.org will begin the 
Installation Wizard, as shown in Figure 3-6. Click the Next button.

3. You will be asked to enter your name (filling in the Organization text box is optional), 
as shown in Figure 3-7. If you wish for others who use your computer (logged in under 
a different account) to be able to use OpenOffice.org, you can leave the default selec-
tion of “Anyone who uses this computer (all users).” If you don’t want this option, 
select the “Only for me” radio button. Click Next.
Figure 3-7. Provide a user name and, optionally, your organization, and select who may 
use OpenOffice.org.
 
4. The next Installation Wizard screen provides you with two options for setup. You may 
install the full OpenOffice.org software suite (Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, and Base) by 
leaving the Complete option selected. Alternatively, choose the Custom option to pick 
which applications you wish to install. For this example, Custom has been selected to 
demonstrate how to install the Writer application (and allow you to choose Calc and 
Impress for Chapters 4 and 5), as shown in Figure 3-8. Click Next to continue.
 
5. The Custom Setup screen lists the individual applications that can be installed. By 
default, all applications are configured to be installed. For this example, you want 
to deselect all the applications except Writer, Calc, and Impress. First, click the icon 
showing a hard drive and a small arrow pointing downward next to OpenOffice.org 
Draw. You will be presented with a list of options, as shown in Figure 3-9.

NNote Of course, you can choose to install the other OpenOffice.org applications, such as Math, and the 
Optional Components selection, now or at a later time. For now, I’ll assume you have chosen to install Writer, 
Calc, and Impress.
 
6. To prevent an application from being installed, select “This feature will not be avail-
able” from the menu. A red X will be added to the left of the application’s name. 
 
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for every application you wish to deselect. Figure 3-10 shows only 
three applications will be installed at this time (Writer, Calc, and Impress). Click Next 
to continue.

8. The Ready to Install the Program screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-11. Click the 
Install button to start the installation.
 
9. Click the Finish button when the Installation Wizard has completed the installation. 
You’re finished! Get ready to start using Writer.
NNote You may delete the OpenOffice.org installation folder after you’ve installed all the applications you 
wish to use.

Word Processing Features
Now that your word processing software is installed, you’re ready to try it out. We’ll walk 
through some common tasks with OpenOffice.org Writer, and then do the same with Google 
Docs Document.
OpenOffice.org Writer Features
We can’t delve into every feature provided by Writer. To do so would require an entire book on 
just that one bit of software. Instead, the next few sections will highlight several features that 
are useful, and that might even surprise you. You’ll see a good sampling of what Writer can do 
for you, and you’ll get a grasp on how the user interface works.
Add a Logo to a Business Letter
Writer makes it trivial to make your business correspondence look professional by adding your 
business logo to your letters. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Create a template letterhead with an address and any other information you wish to 
include. Figure 3-12 shows an example. Then click in the upper-left corner of the docu-
ment to place the insertion point there.

and dragging the mouse. Hold down the Shift key to enlarge or shrink the image with-
out changing the height-to-width ratio.

Save Your Work As a PDF Document
You can save your OpenOffice.org document in a variety of file formats. One popular choice is 
as a PDF file. Here are the steps for exporting your document as a PDF: 

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING

1. After creating your document and formatting it as desired, select File ° Export as PDF, 
as shown in Figure 3-15.
Figure 3-15. Choose to export your file in PDF format.
 
2. In the General tab of the PDF Options dialog box, shown in Figure 3-16, tweak the PDF 
settings if you know specifically how you wish to save the file, or just accept the default 
settings. 
 
3. Optionally, click the Security tab in the PDF Options dialog box. As shown in Figure 
3-17, you can add a password so the file cannot be altered, as well as set restrictions on

Google Docs Document Features
As a SaaS, Google Docs Documents has a different look and feel than Microsoft Word and 
other desktop programs, so it may take some practice to become familiar with it. However, it 
also offers some valuable features not found in typical word processing programs.
Collaborate on a Document with a Friend
Google Docs has an exceptional sharing feature. Even getting close to this type of functionality 
with Microsoft Word or other Microsoft Office applications would require the purchase and 
configuration of a very complicated and expensive service called Microsoft SharePoint Server, 
which comes with Windows Server products (and requires an entire slew of licensing fees, in 
addition to expensive consultant work and a dedicated server). SharePoint offers plenty of 
other features besides collaborating on documents, but for sharing applications it isn’t even 
close to the simplicity provided by Google Docs.

CHAPTER 3 N  WORD PROCESSING
48
Here’s how to share a document you’ve created in Google Docs Document:
 
1. From the Google Docs home page, place a check in the box next to the document you 
wish to share, as shown in the example in Figure 3-21. Then click the Share button on 
the toolbar.
Figure 3-21. Sharing a document you’ve written is as easy as clicking the Share button.
 
2. When the Share this File window opens, enter your friend’s e-mail address in the Invite 
People text box, as shown in the example in Figure 3-22. Uncheck the boxes labeled 
“Collaborators may invite others” and “Invitations may be used by anyone.” Then click 
the Invite Collaborators button.

Create Folders to Organize Your Documents
On the Google Docs home page, you can create folders to organize your documents, as 
follows: 
 
1. Click the New button to see the drop-down menu shown in Figure 3-24. Select Folder 
from this menu.
Figure 3-24. Create folders in Google Docs to help organize your files.
 
2. Your new folder appears. Place a check next to the folder and click the Rename button 
to give it a more memorable name, as shown in the example in Figure 3-25. Press Enter 
when you’re finished.
 
3. Optionally, create a subfolder (a folder within a folder) by clicking one of your exist-
ing folders and choosing to create a new folder (step 1). Your new folder will be placed 
inside the existing folder you selected.

Download the File from Google Docs to Your PC
By default, your documents are stored on Google’s computers, most likely hundreds (if not 
thousands) of miles away, and can be accessed only from a computer with an Internet connec-
tion. If you wish to save a document to your own computer or for transfer to a flash drive or 
writable CD/DVD, you can download the file, as follows:
 
1. Open the Google Docs Document file you wish to download. 
 
2. Select File ° Download file as, and on the fly-out menu, pick the format for saving the 
document. Figure 3-26 shows an example of saving the document as a PDF file.
 
3. In the browse window that opens, browse to the location on your hard drive where you 
want to save the file. 
Once the file is saved on your computer, you may edit it as desired.

There are more free word processing applications available, but be advised that many of these 
applications come with no user support and little documentation. These freebies are often the 
work of a single programmer and are made available “as is.”

Here, you’ll find a list of free “Minimalist Word Processors.” Google Docs and AbiWord are 
listed, as well as some others that you might find useful.
Summary
There’s no arguing that Microsoft Word is an extremely useful and popular application. Most 
users are familiar with its GUI and the location of popular buttons, tools, and other options. 
This familiarity is certainly an argument for sticking with the application.
If you are considering purchasing Microsoft Word, you should examine your specific 
word processing needs and compare those requirements to the features available in Word, 
OpenOffice.org Writer, and Google Docs Document. Even the most advanced writer might 
discover that 99% of the features required can be found in Writer or Document. If you find 
some missing features that are absolutely required for your word processing needs, Microsoft 
Word is ready and available for purchase and installation.
But if you are like most people, your requirements are fairly basic: change fonts, change 
font sizes, add some boldfacing here and some italics there, perform a spell check or mail 
merge, and occasionally highlight some text and track some editing changes in different 
color. Consider giving OpenOffice.org Writer or Google Docs Document a whirl before mak-
ing a purchase. You might be pleasantly surprised to find that all of your word processing 
needs can be met with a simple and free software alternative.

Spreadsheets
After word processing (covered in Chapter 3), the next most commonly used “office” appli-
cation is a spreadsheet program. Entire books have been written on the use of spreadsheets. 
From financial calculations to household budgets to gym workout routines, spreadsheets have 
a variety of uses.
While spreadsheets take care of some behind-the-scenes operations—such as averaging, 
summing, and calculating interest rates—if the user (you) wishes to make the spreadsheet 
useful in any way, you do need some knowledge of formatting and creating formulas (both 
demonstrated in this chapter). For a quick-and-dirty calculation, most users simply plug num-
bers in to cells, generate a formula or two to act on those numbers, get the results, and delete 
the file. But if the spreadsheet is to be used to make dissemination of information easier for 
others, you’ll find that spending some time making your spreadsheets pretty will pay off in 
both ease of use and accuracy.
If you’ve never played with a spreadsheet before—perhaps because you think a spread-
sheet application costs too much or takes too much time to learn—you’ll discover here how 
easy it can be to get started using spreadsheets. A lot of tasks that people commonly try to 
accomplish with a word processor—such as a complex table, a list of reminders, or a schedule 
handout—can be done efficiently and for free with one of the spreadsheet applications recom-
mended in this chapter.
As with word processing, the big name in spreadsheets comes from Microsoft. Microsoft 
Excel (part of the Microsoft Office suite) is considered by most users to be the standard for 
spreadsheet applications, but other products are popular. Some other commonly used spread-
sheet applications include Lotus Symphony Spreadsheets (part of the Symphony suite), Corel 
WordPerfect Office suite’s Quattro Pro X4, and Apple’s own spreadsheet application Numbers, 
which comes bundled in the iWork suite.
But this book’s focus is on alternatives to the commercial packages, and plenty are avail-
able, including two free and powerful spreadsheet applications that can go head-to-head with 
the big names.

TYPICAL USES FOR SPREADSHEETS
While spreadsheets had their start in the business world, users have never felt restricted to using them for 
only accounting purposes. The following are some examples of real-world uses of spreadsheets to keep in 
mind as you read through this chapter:
s Recipes: List the ingredients in one column and the amounts in a second column.
s Exercise routines: Keep track of your exercises, including weight amounts and number of sets and 
repetitions.
s Scripts and novels: Scriptwriters have created custom templates for filling in dialogue, as well as scene 
descriptions and actor movements. Book writers have long used spreadsheets to help manage compli-
cated plots and chapter content.
s Car buying: Many spreadsheet templates allow you to fill in values such as the car’s price, the interest 
rate, and your trade-in value to calculate your monthly payments.
s Mailing lists: Combined with a good word processor, spreadsheets can be used to store name, address, 
city, state, and ZIP code information, and provide these to a text document for printing. The feature is 
called mail merge, and OpenOffice.org Writer and Calc support it.
s Rosters: Keep track of your contacts in a single location, and sort through them easily. This method has 
the benefit of being very easy to load into a custom database. This is great for small businesses, non-
profit organizations, or even video game guilds or clans.
The Defender
Like Microsoft Word for word processing, Microsoft Excel is widely considered to be the stan-
dard for spreadsheet applications, with more than 90% of the market according to a recent 
estimate. Competitors such as Corel’s Quattro Pro X4 and Lotus Symphony Spreadsheets are 
also popular, but more books and web sites are dedicated to Excel than to any other spread-
sheet application. Microsoft Excel 2007 is the current version, and it comes bundled with the 
Microsoft Office suite.
Figure 4-1 shows a new spreadsheet open in Excel. As with Microsoft Word, users of Excel 
will find the typical gamut of buttons—for formatting, printing, saving files, and so on. As in 
most Microsoft products, hovering the mouse pointer over a button will provide a small tool 
tip window that gives a brief description of the button’s purpose. Excel has plenty of power 
features, too, hidden deep within pull-down menus. There are plenty of online resources and 
books that can give you as much detail on Excel as you care to learn.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
57
Figure 4-1. A typical Microsoft Office 2007 spreadsheet consists of rows and columns of cells. 
Most users will find that the list of actual features they tend to use while working in a 
spreadsheet is quite short. Formulas that perform operations such as averaging and summing 
are on that list, as well as the ability to format cells with colors and fonts. Because this list is 
short, the likelihood of you finding these same features and tools available in Excel competi-
tors is very high.
Excel saves files in the *tho format and the new *thot format for Excel 2007 (refer back to 
Chapter 3 for a discussion of file types). The *tho format has become an industry standard, and 
you’ll find most spreadsheet applications will offer the option to save your spreadsheet files in 
this format.
Excel is popular because it works, and it works well. It’s a powerful application, and 
Microsoft has expanded the product over the years by adding so many new features that it’s 
quite likely no single person knows them all. (A complete list of the features found in the latest 
version of Microsoft Excel can be found at dppl6++sss*ie_nkokbp*_ki+at_ah.) But many people 
consider this abundance of features one of Excel’s major flaws. Sure, power users may not be 
able to do without Excel and those hidden features that justify its price. But since Excel isn’t 
sold in price increments based on how you will use the product, you’ve been forced to buy the 
same application as Joe the Super-Accountant and pay the same price—until now.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
58
Before shelling out the big bucks, I suggest that you check out two competitors to Excel 
and see if they offer the features you need in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet alternatives we’ll 
look at in this chapter are OpenOffice.org Calc and Google Docs Spreadsheet. If you find that 
features you absolutely require are missing from these applications, you can always purchase 
Excel later.
The Contenders
It’s true that Excel is feature-packed, but you don’t need to worry that you’ll be sacrificing 
power for cost if you switch to a competing application. OpenOffice.org Calc is also crammed 
with powerful functions, and many users who switch to Calc agree that the two products are 
fairly well matched.
Calc looks and feels similar to Excel, but when you consider how a spreadsheet works, this 
really shouldn’t come as a surprise. Data is entered in rows and columns. Rows are numbered, 
and columns are given letters. Where a row and column intersect, you have a cell. The cell ID 
is its column letter and row number, such as cell A1. To select a cell for data entry or modi-
fication, you click it with the mouse. And, as with Excel, you can use formulas that perform 
calculations on the values in cells.
The other alternative covered here is Google Docs Spreadsheet. If you do not need a lot of 
bells and whistles with your spreadsheet application, I think you’ll find this Google Docs appli-
cation right up your alley. While it doesn’t have every feature imaginable, it does have the most 
reliable and popular features that the majority of users will need. 
One of the nicest features of Google Docs Spreadsheet is its simplicity. Most features are 
available with a single click or within a single menu. There are no hidden power features to 
spend time searching for—what you see is what you get. 
I suggest that you try both Google Docs Spreadsheet and OpenOffice.org Calc, and then 
decide which one provides the best results for you.
OpenOffice.org Calc
OpenOffice.org Calc is the spreadsheet application that is part of the OpenOffice.org software 
suite (introduced in Chapter 3). Just like OpenOffice.org Writer, Calc has a user interface that is 
simple to use and easy to navigate.
Calc contains extensive help documentation. Figure 4-2 shows the general OpenOffice.
org Help window that appears when you select the Help ° OpenOffice Help menu option 
from Calc. You can type keywords in the search box at the top of the tab on the left side of the 
window to find topics of interest. Double-click an item listed in the tab, such as an entry on 
the Index tab, and the right side of the Help window will provide links to relevant topics and 
articles. Remember that you can also hover the mouse pointer over any button in the Calc 
application to see a tool tip showing its function.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
59
Figure 4-2. OpenOffice.org Calc has detailed Help documentation built-in.
As with any application that’s new to you, you can learn quite a bit by simply experiment-
ing with the buttons, clicking menus, and examining the features offered. I’ll show you some 
sample tasks that you can perform using Calc shortly, but for now, try out the application by 
entering text and values in various cells. You’ll find that features such as copying, pasting, 
deleting, and moving entries work in Calc just as they do in other spreadsheet and word pro-
cessing applications.
The OpenOffice.org web site (dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*knc) and its help forum (dppl6++
oqllknp*klajkbbe_a*knc) are great places to start if you have questions that aren’t answered 
by the built-in help documentation. You can post your questions and sift through other topics 
that might be of interest to you. The site also provides templates and clipart that can be used 
in Calc and the other OpenOffice.org applications. Just visit dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*knc and 
click “I want to do more with my OpenOffice.org.”
Google Docs Spreadsheet
Google offers its own spreadsheet application called Google Docs Spreadsheet, which works 
just like Microsoft Excel (and most other spreadsheets as well). Google Docs Spreadsheet may 
not have all the features of Excel, but Google continues to develop new tools and features for 
this application, expanding its usefulness and power. 
NTip The Google Docs Spreadsheet window has a New features link in the upper-right corner (see Fig-
ure 4-4). Click it to get a rundown on all the updates Google has added.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
60
As with Google Docs Document (covered in Chapter 3), Google Docs Spreadsheet is a 
SaaS, and requires no installation of software. All you need to use it is an Internet connection. 
And just as with Google Docs Document, you can collaborate on documents with other users, 
access your spreadsheets from any computer with an Internet connection, and save your 
spreadsheets in a variety of standard formats (Excel, PDF, HTML, and so on).
Once you’ve logged in to Google Docs (if you haven’t already done so), you’ll find the user 
interface is similar to that shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3. You use Google Docs applications within a web browser.
To begin using Google Docs Spreadsheet, click the New menu on the top-left side of the 
screen and choose Spreadsheet from the drop-down list. A new spreadsheet opens, ready to 
use, as shown in Figure 4-4.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
61

I will take you through a handful of tasks using Google Docs Spreadsheet later in 
the chapter, but the Help menu is always available if you need assistance. Choose Help 
° Google Docs Help Center, and use the search feature by entering keywords (or entire 
phrases and questions) related to the information you need. 
NNote Remember that Google gives you the ability to suggest features for inclusion for future updates by 
clicking the “Let us know link” in the online help.

POTENTIAL USER GROUPS AND BENEFITS
Just as some groups of users are likely to gain the largest advantage by using free word processing software, 
as discussed in the previous chapter, certain groups can potentially reap huge benefits from free spreadsheet 
software such as OpenOffice.org Calc and Google Docs Spreadsheet: These include college/university stu-
dents, small business owners, working groups, and retirees. Here’s why:
s Students: Spreadsheets can be extremely useful for organizing daily schedules—timetables of classes, 
study groups, work, and let’s not forget social events (a.k.a. parties). Students in business classes will, 
sooner or later, find spreadsheets are a required part of some coursework. Using Google Docs Spread-
sheet, students can access their worksheets from any computer on campus that has Internet access.
s Small business owners: Not having to spend large amounts of money on software is one way small 
business owners can give their business a boost. Spreadsheets are a fairly typical application used by 
most business owners, and what better way to save money and keep your business organized than 
using a free spreadsheet application? From tracking inventories to maintaining customer mailing lists, 
OpenOffice.org Calc or Google Docs Spreadsheet can fill an immediate need for software at zero cost. 
s Working groups: Sharing and collaborating on spreadsheets often introduces errors. If your work 
involves sharing and collaborating on a single spreadsheet, a Google Docs Spreadsheet project can 
reduce inefficiency and errors that come from needing to share multiple versions of an important 
spreadsheet within a working group.
s Retirees: Common uses of spreadsheets for retirees include tracking of retirement income and main-
taining a budget. Since many retirees are on a fixed income, knowing where the money is being spent 
is as important as allocating how much is available for specific activities. An OpenOffice.org Calc 
spreadsheet would be perfect. It doesn’t need to be shared, and it is easily customizable, allowing retir-
ees to create spreadsheets that are extremely specific to their financial situation.
Where to Get the Software
If you read about getting the word processing software in the previous chapter, you’ll find the 
material here basically the same. OpenOffice.org Calc is available from the OpenOffice.org 
site, and Google Docs Spreadsheet just requires a Google account to use. 
OpenOffice.org Calc
OpenOffice Calc is part of the OpenOffice.org suite of software and requires an installation file 
to be downloaded to your computer. Follow these steps to obtain Calc:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*knc+.
 
2. Click “I want to download OpenOffice.org” to obtain the latest version.
 
3. During the download, take note of the web page that opens. It contains links that allow 
you to provide feedback, ask questions, and volunteer to help further develop the 
product.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
63
Once the OpenOffice.org download is complete, you’re ready to install and begin using 
Calc. Jump ahead to the “Notes on OpenOffice.org Calc Installation” section to get started.
Google Docs Spreadsheet 
Google Docs Spreadsheet differs from OpenOffice.org Calc in that there is no software to 
install. Follow these steps to begin using Google Docs Spreadsheet:
 
1. Visit dppl6++`k_o*ckkcha*_ki.
 
2. If you already have a Google account (for Google Gmail or another Google service), log 
in. Otherwise, click the Get Started button and follow the instructions to create your 
free user account.
NNote You can also take a tour of Google Docs or watch a video from the Welcome to Google Docs page 
(dppl6++`k_o*ckkcha*_ki). Just click the Take a Tour or New Features link to investigate Google Docs 
before you sign up.
Once you log in to Google Docs, you’re ready to get started. Feel free to open a new 
spreadsheet and experiment, as discussed in the previous section.
Notes on OpenOffice.org Calc Installation
The steps for installing OpenOffice.org applications are covered in Chapter 3. Refer to the 
“Notes on OpenOffice.org Installation” section in that chapter for instructions. 
If you’ve already run the Installation Wizard to install another OpenOffice.org application, 
but did not choose to install Calc at that time, choose the Modify option when you run the 
setup program.
Following the instructions in Chapter 3 takes you to the Custom Setup screen shown 
in Figure 4-5. Remember that to prevent an application from being installed, click the small 
triangle next to an application’s name and select “This feature will not be available.” A red X 
will be added to the left of the application’s name. To select an application for installation, 
select “This feature will be installed on local hard drive.” Figure 4-5 shows that Calc has been 
selected to be installed at this time, along with Writer and Impress.
After you choose the OpenOffice.org applications to install and click Next, the File Type 
screen will appear, asking if you wish to make OpenOffice.org Calc the default application 
when opening Excel spreadsheets (any file name ending with *tho). (For OpenOffice Writer 
and Impress, you will also be given the option to allow those applications to open *`k_ and 
*llo files, or Word and PowerPoint files, respectively.) Accept this offer, and click Next.
After you’ve completed the installation, you’re ready to start using Calc.

Spreadsheet Features
Now you’re ready to try out your spreadsheet software. We’ll walk through some common 
tasks with OpenOffice.org Calc, and then do the same with Google Docs Spreadsheet.
OpenOffice.org Calc Features
To give you an idea of how the Calc user interface works and the features available, the next 
few sections walk you through formatting and publishing a spreadsheet, as well as performing 
calculations within it.
Jazz Up Your Spreadsheet with Colored Column Headers 
Creating column headers that can be read quickly makes your spreadsheet more legible (and 
pretty!). Here’s how:
 
1. After creating your spreadsheet, select a group of cells that you want to be colored. You 
can use the standard mouse and keyboard techniques to select cells. Clicking the row 
number selects the entire row, and clicking the column letter selects the whole column. 
In the example in Figure 4-6, the column headers—Date, Exercise, Set 1, and so on—
are selected.
 
2. Select Format ° Cells. 

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS

3. In the Format Cells dialog box, click the Background tab, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
Figure 4-7. The Background tab lets you apply a color to selected cells.
 
4. Click the color you wish to apply to the selected cells, and then click the OK button. 
The color will be applied, as shown in the example in Figure 4-8.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
66

Publish Your Spreadsheet As a Web Page
You can share your work with others, even if they don’t have a spreadsheet program, by saving 
it as an HTML file. Then it can be opened in a web browser. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. After creating your spreadsheet and saving it, select File ° Save As.
 
2. In the Save As dialog box, click the drop-down menu for the “Save as type” option and 
select HTML Document, as shown in Figure 4-9. Enter a name for the HTML file, and 
then click the Save button.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
67

3. You might receive a warning that some formatting options in your spreadsheet may 
not be able to be retained in an HTML document. Click the “Keep current format” 
option.
 
4. Browse to the HTML file you saved and double-click it. Your spreadsheet will now open 
in your web browser, as shown in Figure 4-10. You may upload this file to a personal 
web site or e-mail it as an attachment.

Find a Formula/Function and Apply It to a Spreadsheet
Formulas are the most powerful and commonly used feature of spreadsheets. In fact, until 
you start working with formulas, spreadsheets are basically word processor documents that 
are divided into cells. Learning how to use formulas unlocks the real power of spreadsheets. 
As you’ll see in this example, applying formulas is slightly more complex than formatting or 
saving your spreadsheet, but the reward is that you’ll be a real, honest-to-goodness spread-
sheet analyst.
In this example, we want to multiply the number of repetitions in a set of an exercise by 
the amount of weight used, and record those values in the Subtotal column, as shown in Fig-
ure 4-11. Once all the subtotals are calculated, we will then get the grand total.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
69
Figure 4-11. Use formulas to determine the total amount of weight used.
With the spreadsheet shown in Figure 4-11 created, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the cell in the Subtotal column that will contain the result of your calculation. In 
this example, first select the cell corresponding to the row holding the Deadlift data, as 
shown in Figure 4-12.
Figure 4-12. Select a cell that will hold a calculated value.
 
2. Select Insert ° Function.
 
3. In the Function Wizard’s first page, scroll down the list of functions to find your for-
mula. A description of the calculation performed by the formula will be provided. In 
this example, choose PRODUCT (because we want to multiply the value in the Set 1 
column, the number of repetitions, by the value in the Weight column), as shown in 
Figure 4-13. Then click the Next button.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
70
Figure 4-13. Select the function to be applied to selected cells.
 
4. The next page of the Function Wizard is waiting for the values that will be multiplied 
together. Each value is given a variable name of Number x, and you can either click a 
cell to assign that cell ID or type in the cell ID. Figure 4-14 shows that cell D6 has been 
selected for Number 1 and cell E6 has been selected for Number 2.
 
5. Click the OK button. The product of the two selected cells will be calculated for the 
Subtotal column’s cell. 
 
6. Repeat steps for 1 through 5 for the remaining rows. When you’ve finished, the Subto-
tal column will contain a group of values, as shown in Figure 4-15.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
71

7. Now we need to sum all the values in the Subtotal column and display that value in 
the Total cell. Click the cell where the Total value will be displayed, and then click the 
Sum button. As indicated in Figure 4-16, the Sum button is the one with the uppercase 
sigma character.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
72

8. While holding down the mouse button, drag and select all the cells that will be added 
together, as shown in Figure 4-17. Then release the mouse button and press the Enter 
key. The total will be displayed, as shown in Figure 4-18.
NNote You can also use Ctrl-click and Shift-click to select a collection of cells that you wish to use in a 
calculation. Hold down the Ctrl key while you click to select cells that are not adjacent to one another. Alter-

Google Docs Spreadsheet Features
Google Docs Spreadsheet is the right tool when you need to share your spreadsheet and 
make sure it is kept up-to-date, and you are not concerned with customizing it and keeping it 
private.
Here, I’ll show you how to create a chart from your spreadsheet and how to share a 
spreadsheet with others.
Create a Chart
Google Docs Spreadsheet can create charts as easily as Excel does. And the chart you create 
is immediately shareable after you publish its spreadsheet; it doesn’t need to be e-mailed 
around. Here are the steps for adding a chart:
 
1. After you have created a spreadsheet with data, select Insert ° Chart. 
 
2. In the Create Chart window, shown in Figure 4-19, select the type of chart you wish to 
use. For this example, select a Bars chart.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
74
Figure 4-19. Creating a chart using data from your spreadsheet is extremely simple.
 
3. In the Labels section of the window, add labels for the chart title, horizontal axis, and 
vertical axis, as desired. For this example, title the chart Test 1 Scores. Name the hori-
zontal axis, which will provide the test scores, Scores. Name the vertical axis, which will 
list the student names, Student Names (see Figure 4-20). 
 
4. Use the mouse to select the data in the spreadsheet you want to include in the chart. 
For this example, remember to include column A, which contains the student names, 
and row 1, which contains the test number. The cell range appears in the What data? 
box, as shown in Figure 4-20.
 
5. Check the preview of the chart. Make changes if necessary. Then click the Save chart 
button.

75
Figure 4-20. Provide labels and select the data to be included in the chart. This figure shows the 
settings that appear when you choose to edit a chart, which are the same as those in the Create 
Chart window.
The chart is created and inserted into your worksheet, as shown in Figure 4-21. You can 
click the chart to select it; drag and drop it where desired; or use the drop-down menu to edit, 
delete, save, or move the chart.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS

Publish Your Spreadsheet
After you’ve set up a spreadsheet, you can share it with your coworkers or family, even if they 
don’t have a spreadsheet program. This is a huge plus to using Google Docs Spreadsheet. 
OpenOffice.org Calc will put your spreadsheet into HTML web page, but it won’t publish it.
However, before you choose to publish your spreadsheet, be aware that no security is 
provided, so anyone with the URL may view the spreadsheet data. It is also possible that your 
published data might be found using an Internet search. Additionally, keep in mind that since 
your data is residing on Google’s servers, Google is entitled to verify that the content doesn’t 
violate any of its Terms of Service. Realize that your “private” spreadsheet data might not be so 
private if Google is allowed to examine it. So, for business purposes, Google Docs Spreadsheet 
might not be the best solution.
You can choose to publish a spreadsheet and make it available to anyone with Internet 
access as follows:

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
77
 
1. Open the spreadsheet you wish to publish (such as the one in Figure 4-21).
 
2. Click the Share button in the upper-right corner of the window to see the drop-down 
menu shown in Figure 4-22.
Figure 4-22. The Share button gives you options for publishing your spreadsheet.
NNote Other options here include the ability to stop publishing and to republish if changes have been 
made. You can also choose individual sheets (Sheet1, for example) if your spreadsheet contains multiple 
sheets. Additional features are available, such as subscribing to the published Google Docs file.
 
3. Select the “Publish as a web page” option. You will be given a URL. 
 
4. Provide the URL to any users who wish to view your spreadsheet. 
Investigate Further
Google Docs Spreadsheet and OpenOffice.org Calc aren’t the only free spreadsheets out there. 
Here are two additional spreadsheet applications that are enjoying popularity:
s 'NUMERIC, available from dppl6++sss*cjkia*knc+lnkfa_po+cjqiane_+
s 3IMPLE 3PREADSHEET, available from dppl6++sss*oeilha)cnkqls]na*`a+_io+

Summary
Spreadsheets are useful, no doubt. The question for you is whether your spreadsheets require 
(or might ever require) advanced calculations and features not found in the free spreadsheet 
software.

CHAPTER 4 N  SPREADSHEETS
78
Before making an expensive purchase, it’s definitely worth a bit of investigative time on 
your part. Examine and experiment with OpenOffice.org Calc, Google Docs Spreadsheet, or 
one of the other free spreadsheet applications. Compare your needs to what is available in 
these free applications. If you find them lacking, then by all means invest in the product that 
gives you what you need.
Many spreadsheet users may be surprised to find that the functions and features they 
require don’t make up too long a list. Google Docs Spreadsheet and OpenOffice.org Calc con-
tinue to expand their features, so it is likely that everything you’ll need in a spreadsheet can be 
found in one of these free but powerful applications.

Slide Shows
Before slide show applications came along, anyone giving a presentation had to rely on some 
low-tech solutions: handouts, overhead projection, and sometimes even a chalkboard. These 
days, if you need to display information, pictures, or other items to a group of any size, a slide 
show application is your best bet. 
Early slide show applications could support only text, text formatting, and the occasional 
embedded GIF or BMP image. Today, most slide show applications can support video and 
audio as well.
Modern slide show applications, also called presentation software, allow a presenter to 
use color, animation, and sound to engage viewers, hold their attention, and deliver informa-
tion in a more memorable way. This isn’t to say that all slide shows are enjoyable. Many are 
bland or crammed with too much information. The key to creating a useful presentation is 
being aware of the capabilities of your application and not overusing the available features.
The current big name in presentation software is PowerPoint from Microsoft. PowerPoint 
is part of the Microsoft Office suite. Of course, since I’m mentioning it in this book, you can 
guess that there are free applications that offer features similar to PowerPoint. In this chapter, 
we’ll focus on two alternatives: OpenOffice.org Impress and Google Docs Presentation.
NNote One thing that presentation software is great for is building a family photo album, ready to go in 
slide show format. Slide shows are also seeing usage outside the boring-your-friends crowd, in settings as 
diverse as storyboarding for animation or personal organization, index-card style.
The Defender
Microsoft PowerPoint is king in the business world. Would you believe that many large cor-
porations require their employees to take PowerPoint training and to learn how to use a 
standardized corporate template for all presentations they create? 
PowerPoint works like the other Microsoft Office applications. A toolbar of buttons runs 
across the top of the screen, and drop-down menus offer a substantial number of features. In 
the main work area, you enter your text, place pictures and other items, and select from back-
ground themes or create your own. Figure 5-1 shows a slide show in PowerPoint.
PowerPoint saves files in the default *llp format, and PowerPoint 2007 also offers the new 
*llpt format (similar to the *`k_t and *thot files that Word and Excel create). Opening a *llp 
79

CHAPTER 5 N  SLIDE SHOWS
80
or *llpt file requires PowerPoint and gives you the ability to edit the slide show. The *llo for-
mat is also popular. This format creates an encapsulated file that can be opened and viewed 
(but not edited), even if PowerPoint is not installed on the computer. 
Figure 5-1. A Microsoft PowerPoint slide show
With PowerPoint, you can embed images, video, recordings, and more. Text can be 
entered and font sizes changed. Color can be applied to text, as well as to graphic elements 
such as arrows (used for drawing the eye to specific points on a slide). You can select a presen-
tation theme that will be applied to every slide you create. The theme controls items such as 
the background color/image, font sizes and colors, and placement of a company logo.
There is no arguing that PowerPoint has set the bar for slide show applications. With all 
the built-in templates and clipart, a new user can have an impressive presentation up and run-
ning in very little time. Built-in help files and online support are also available. 
PowerPoint is feature-filled (a complete list of the features found in the latest version of 
Microsoft PowerPoint can be found at dppl6++sss*ie_nkokbp*_ki+lksanlkejp), but as with 
most Microsoft products, you may find yourself using only a handful of basic features. And 
you’ve probably guessed by now that PowerPoint isn’t cheap. As Chapters 3 and 4 dem-
onstrated, many users are paying for features that are readily found in free applications. 
And again, I recommend that you examine a few of the competing (and free) products and 

CHAPTER 5 N  SLIDE SHOWS
81
determine if they offer the features you need. Two applications you should consider testing are 
OpenOffice.org Impress and Google Docs Presentation.
The Contenders
If you need to create slide shows, whether for work or personal reasons, you have options 
other than Microsoft PowerPoint. If you’ve read through Chapters 3 and 4, you know that 
OpenOffice.org has its own slide show/presentation application called Impress. If you’ve dis-
covered the power of OpenOffice.org Writer and Calc, then it won’t come as a surprise that 
OpenOffice.org Impress offers a full range of features—for free. I use it when I need to make a 
slide show, and I’ve found it to be easy to master.
A less feature-packed but still extremely useful slide show creation tool is Google Docs 
Presentation. It requires no installation, and is extremely simple to use, totally free, and always 
being improved by its Google programming team. 
OpenOffice.org Impress
Impress is the OpenOffice.org slide show application, and, as its name implies, it’s definitely 
impressive. Each time you open the application, you’re immediately led through a small set of 
steps to help you select the basic look and design of your presentation. 
Figure 5-2 shows the start of a wizard that will guide you through creating a new pre-
sentation. You can cancel the wizard if you like, but if you’re new to presentation software, 
I suggest walking through it the first time to see what decisions and options are available. 
The wizard gives you the opportunity to quickly set up a presentation template that will be 
used throughout your entire slide show. Any selections you make while using the wizard can 
be changed later.
Figure 5-2. OpenOffice.org Impress has a great wizard to help you get started.

CHAPTER 5 N  SLIDE SHOWS
82
As you step through the wizard, you’ll choose whether to start a new presentation, open 
an existing one, or select a template (such as a slide show layout with company logo). Addi-
tional selections include prebuilt templates and simple effects. Finally, click the Create button, 
and you’ll be presented with your selected template (if you chose one; otherwise you’ll see a 
blank screen), as shown in Figure 5-3. From there, you can start working on your slide show.
Figure 5-3. An OpenOffice.org Impress slide show with a preconfigured template, ready for your 
information
In Figure 5-3, you can see the main work area in the center of the window. The toolbar 
along the top offers access to many features, and various layouts that can be applied are visible 
along the right edge of the window. As you add more slides to your presentation, a small image 
of each will be visible in the left panel. Custom drawing tools (such as tools to add lines and 
shapes) are available along the bottom edge of the window. 
As I said, Impress doesn’t skimp on features. If you’re a PowerPoint user, this application 
is going to prove to you that the OpenOffice.org suite of software is capable of competing in 
the big leagues.
I’ll cover some sample tasks later in the chapter, but for now, you can use the wizard to try 
out the software. And as with all the other OpenOffice.org applications, help is only a mouse 
click away. The OpenOffice.org web site has a help forum (dppl6++oqllknp*klajkbbe_a*knc) if 
you have questions that aren’t answered by the built-in help documentation. Post questions, 
search existing topics, and offer help to other users if you can. Additional templates and clipart 
are available for download by visiting dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*knc and selecting “I want to do 
more with my OpenOffice.org.”

Google Docs Presentation
Google Docs has its own slide show application called Presentation. Like the Google Docs 
applications I recommended in the previous chapters, Presentation is SaaS, and requires no 
installation of software. All you need to use it is an Internet connection. Your presentation will 
be saved online, on Google’s servers, and available to you whenever you log in to your Google 
account from any computer connected to the Internet.
To use Google Docs Presentation, simply log in to Google Docs, click the New menu, and 
select Presentation. As you can see in Figure 5-4, Presentation looks similar to Impress. You 
add text, video, and images to the workspace in the center of the screen, the toolbar is avail-
able along the top of the browser window, and images of the slides in the presentation are 
displayed in the panel on the left.
Figure 5-4. Presentation starts with a blank title slide, ready for your additions.
I’ll walk you through a handful of sample tasks using Google Docs Presentation later in the 
chapter. For now, you can try creating some slides and see what the toolbar and menus have 
to offer. The Help menu has options for viewing simple tutorials on performing specific tasks.

Where to Get the Software
You’re not going to find OpenOffice.org Impress or Google Docs Presentation at a store. 
OpenOffice.org Impress, another creation of the OpenOffice.org project, is available for down-
load as part of the full OpenOffice.org package. Google Docs Presentation is available from 
`k_o*ckkcha*_ki.
OpenOffice.org Impress
OpenOffice.org Impress is part of the OpenOffice.org suite of applications. Here are the gen-
eral steps to follow to install OpenOffice.org:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*klajkbbe_a*knc+.
 
2. Click on “I want to download OpenOffice.org” to obtain the latest version.
 
3. During the download, take note of the web page that opens. It contains links that allow 
you to provide feedback, ask questions, and volunteer to help further develop the 
product.
Once the OpenOffice.org download is complete, you’re ready to install and begin using 
Impress. Skip ahead to the “Notes on OpenOffice.org Impress Installation” section to get 
started.
Google Docs Presentation
As noted earlier, Google Docs Presentation is a SaaS, delivered over the Internet. You don’t 
need to install anything. All you need is a Google account. Access Presentation as follows:
 
1. Visit dppl6++`k_o*ckkcha*_ki.
 
2. If you already have a Google account (for Gmail or another Google service), log in. Oth-
erwise, click the Get Started button and follow the instructions to create your free user 
account.
NNote You can also take a tour of Google Docs or watch a video from the Welcome to Google Docs page 
(dppl6++`k_o*ckkcha*_ki). Just click the Take a Tour or New Features link to investigate Google Docs 
before you sign up.
Once you log in to Google Docs, you’re ready to get started. Feel free to open a new pre-
sentation and experiment, as discussed in the previous section.

Notes on OpenOffice.org Impress Installation
The steps for installing OpenOffice.org Impress are almost identical to those described for 
installing OpenOffice.org Writer and Calc, covered in Chapters 3 and 4. 
To install OpenOffice.org Impress, follow the instructions in the “Notes on OpenOffice.
org Installation” section in Chapter 3. If you’ve already run the Installation Wizard to install 
another OpenOffice.org application, and did not install Impress at the time, choose the Modify 
option when you run the setup program.
Following the instructions in Chapter 3 takes you to the Custom Setup screen shown in 
Figure 5-5. To choose Impress for installation, click the small triangle next to its name and 
select “This feature will be installed on local hard drive” from the drop-down menu. To pre-
vent an application from being installed, select “This feature will not be available” from the 
drop-down menu. Figure 5-5 shows that Impress has been selected to be installed at this time, 
along with Writer and Calc.
Figure 5-5. Select OpenOffice.org applications to be installed on your hard drive.
After you click Next in the Custom Setup screen, you will see the File Type screen, asking if 
you wish to make OpenOffice.org Impress the default application when opening a PowerPoint 
presentation (any file name ending with *llp). For now, place a check in the box for Microsoft 
PowerPoint Presentations and click Next. 
The Ready to Install Program screen will appear next. Simply click the Install button to 
start the installation.
When the Installation Wizard is finished, click the Finish button. You’re now ready to start 
using Impress.

Slide Show Application Features
This section walks you through a handful of sample tasks that can be performed using the 
free presentation software. I won’t cover the basics of creating slides and adding text, because 
those are such easy tasks. Instead, I’ll cover some interesting, not-so-obvious tasks that will 
prove useful in adding a bit of flash to your presentations. 
You’ll notice how OpenOffice.org Impress allows you to create rich presentations that are 
portable and don’t require an Internet connection. Google Docs Presentation is well suited for 
simpler slide shows that will be presented online.
OpenOffice.org Impress Features
OpenOffice.org Impress doesn’t disappoint for feature richness. Everything you can do in 
PowerPoint, you can do in Impress. Here, I’ll show you how to add video to a slide and use 
some of Impress’s drawing tools. 
Add Video to a Slide
Adding video to a slide show often pleasantly surprises the audience, who might be expecting 
only text and pictures. Here’s how to add punch to your presentations with video:
 
1. With your slide open in Impress, select a layout that allows enough space to add a 
video. In the example in Figure 5-6, the third template down in the left column of the 
Layouts pane is selected.
Figure 5-6. Select a template for the slide where you will add video.

2. Enter a title and any other text you would like to appear, and format the text if desired. 
Figure 5-7 shows a title and some text added to the slide.

3. Select Insert ° Movie and Sound. Browse to the location of your video and select it, as 
shown in Figure 5-8. Then click the Open button.
 
4. Drag the inserted video box and place it where you want it to play from the slide, as 
shown in Figure 5-9.

Google Docs Presentation Features
While not as rich (yet!) as OpenOffice.org Impress, Google Docs Presentation is still a capable 
presentation tool. Here, I’ll show you how to pick a theme, add pictures and video, and pub-
lish your slide show.
Change a Slide Show Theme
When you first open Presentation, the slide show template shows a clean (and very dull) page, 
ready for your additions (refer back to Figure 5-4). Here’s how to choose another theme:
 
1. With your slide open in Presentation, select Edit ° Change theme, as shown in 
Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18. The default slide show template is boring, so change the theme.
 
2. You will see a window that offers a variety of templates, as shown in Figure 5-19. Select 
one, and the background will change instantly, as shown in Figure 5-20. Keep in mind 
that your selection affects all the slides in your slide show; you cannot choose multiple 
themes.

CHAPTER 5 N  SLIDE SHOWS
96
Insert a Picture and Video
You can insert text, images, and shapes in your Presentation slides. Google Docs also allows 
you to insert video, but it must be hosted on ukqpq^a*_ki. The video in your presentation 
will be sent from YouTube’s web service (another form of SaaS provision!). This means that 
in order for the videos in your slide show to play, you’ll need to present them on an Internet-
connected computer. 
NNote A big difference between Google Docs Presentation and OpenOffice.org Impress is that Impress will 
let you save your presentations offline. With Presentation, important parts of your presentation will stay on 
Google’s servers. 
Here’s how to add a photo and video:
 
1. With your slide open in Presentation, select Insert ° Image. Browse to the location of 
the desired image and click the OK button. Your photo will be inserted into the slide, as 
shown in Figure 5-21. You can resize and move the photo as desired.

1. Click the Share button in the upper-right corner of the Google Docs screen and select 
the Publish/embed option, as shown in Figure 5-24. 
 
2. Click the Publish document button. You will be given the URL link to e-mail to those 
you wish to see your slide show, as shown in Figure 5-25. You also have the opportunity 
to change the size of the presentation (the choices are small, medium, or large). HTML 
code is provided so you can embed it (place not only a link, but the full slide show) in 
a blog or web site. Click the Stop publishing button if you no longer want to share the 
slide show.

Investigate Further
Slide shows are an art form all to themselves. Of course, you can find plenty of online discus-
sions of how to create useful and interesting presentations. But if you’re looking for ways to 
make your slide shows more engaging and relevant, I suggest two books that I have found to 
be worth their weight in gold:
s Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds (New Riders, 2008)
s Slide:ology by Nancy Duarte (O’Reilly, 2008)
These books provide you tons of examples and explain what works, what doesn’t work, 
and why.
Summary
Whether you need a slide show for school, work, or other venue, don’t think for a moment that 
your only option is Microsoft PowerPoint. You don’t need to worry that your presentation will 
lack eye-catching features if you use Impress. This OpenOffice.org application has a ton of fea-
tures that will give your slide shows plenty of punch and polish. If you don’t need a lot of glitz 
and glamour in your slide show, you’ll find that Google Docs Presentation has enough features 
to get your slide show up and running in a minimum of time. And the ability to share your Pre-
sentation slide show over the Internet immediately is a huge bonus!

E-Mail and Calendar
I love e-mail. And I love my calendar application. E-mail helps me to keep in touch with my 
family and friends (and my editor, a member of both groups). My calendar reminds me where 
I’m supposed to be or what’s due and at what time (the Chapter 6 draft is due tomorrow!). 
My calendar will even send an e-mail message to me as a reminder (or a text message to my 
mobile phone, if I prefer)—how cool is that? 
One day it hit me how dependent I had become on both of these applications. Like my 
mobile phone and my vehicle, my e-mail and calendar tools had become indispensable to 
both my personal life and my work. And just like losing my mobile phone or having the car in 
the shop for repairs, if my e-mail and calendar were to become unavailable, I would quickly 
become stressed and unproductive.
I never gave much thought to having reliable access to my e-mail and calendar. I was 
using Microsoft Outlook, one of the most widely used personal information management 
applications (PIM, for short). My e-mail was stored on my laptop’s hard drive, as was my 
address book and my calendar. Everything was going smoothly. And then my Outlook appli-
cation crashed.
I was able to recover most of my e-mail and all of my contacts, but not my calendar 
information. It took hours of work, and my stress levels were off the chart. A few weeks later, 
a friend at my favorite coffee shop (with free Wi-Fi Internet access) listened as I told him this 
horror story. He pulled out his laptop and proceeded to introduce me to Google’s e-mail appli-
cation, Gmail, and Google Calendar. An hour later, I was a convert. And you may be, too, by 
the end of this chapter.
The Defender
I never thought I would walk away from Microsoft Outlook. It’s a popular application and 
comes bundled with Microsoft Office. “Light” versions—Outlook Express or Microsoft Mail—
come installed as the default e-mail client on most Windows computers. Since I was paying 
big bucks for Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, it would be a waste of money not to load 
and use Outlook, right?
Outlook is definitely the king when it comes to e-mail, address book, and calendar fea-
tures. After you install Outlook, it can be configured to receive your e-mail, and you can begin 
adding contact information to your address book. You can create filters (special rules that 
can help you eliminate junk e-mail or send special e-mail messages to specific locations). You 
can create a signature (with your name, phone number, and web site address, for example) to 
appear automatically at the bottom of all your sent messages. You can add appointments to 
your calendar. (A complete list of the features found in the latest version of Microsoft Outlook 
can be found at dppl6++sss*ie_nkokbp*_ki+kqphkkg.)

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
102
Outlook’s user interface uses a familiar folder storage design (which some users find 
cluttered—this author included), as shown in Figure 6-1. E-mail messages are placed inside 
folders with names such as Deleted Items, Sent Items, and Inbox. Clicking a folder on the left 
side of the screen displays that folder’s messages in the middle of the screen. Clicking a mes-
sage allows you to view its contents on the right side of the screen, or you can double-click to 
open the message in full-screen view.
Figure 6-1. Outlook uses a folder hierarchy to store e-mail.
But here’s the main problem with Outlook (besides the fact that it is expensive): your 
data—every bit of it—is stored on your hard drive. This means that if you want to send an 
e-mail message, check your calendar, or find a contact’s phone number, you need to be sitting 
at your computer. Basically, if you’re sitting at a friend’s computer or using an Internet kiosk, 
access to your Outlook e-mail and calendar just isn’t possible. 
Yes, there are options for accessing Outlook, but for most users, they aren’t practical. 
For example, you could use remote access to your computer (medium difficulty and involves 
configuring your computer to allow another computer to access your hard drive) or use 
Microsoft Exchange Server to hold your data (high difficulty and expensive to purchase as well 
as maintain).
Outlook has several other drawbacks:

s ! LOT OF EXPERIENCED USERS DONT LIKE THE WAY THAT /UTLOOK IS CODED "Y MODERN STAN-
dards, it’s a real resource hog. To see for yourself (if you’re running Outlook), press 
Ctrl+Alt+Del, click Task Manager, and click the Processes tab. Typically, you’ll find that 
KQPHKKG*ATA is taking up 40MB to 50MB of system RAM.
s "Y DEFAULT /UTLOOK PLAYS A hMAILRECEIVEDv SOUND AND POPS UP AN EMAIL ALERT IN THE
lower-right corner of your screen. Besides being irritating, these messages are very high 
priority, so they may pop up in the middle of a movie or while you’re playing a game.
s 3EARCHING FOR A SPECIFIC EMAIL MESSAGE CAN BE TIMECONSUMING IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF
messages. Outlook does provide a search tool that allows you to search all folders 
at once, but it isn’t as powerful or fast as the one provided by Google for its Gmail 
application.
As for Microsoft Outlook’s calendar, I can say that while it is a powerful tool with plenty 
of features, I would still prefer to be able to access it from any computer or my mobile phone. 
And I’m not willing to spend the money to rent a server and install my own copy of Microsoft 
Exchange Server on it ($699 for the standard version) or purchase the server hardware and 
Windows Server 2007 operating system software ($2,000 or more) to run Exchange and have 
those options!
Because Outlook comes with Microsoft Office, most people get their first experience with 
e-mail and a calendar by using this PIM at work. That familiarity with Outlook typically makes 
it the first consideration for a home computer. But Outlook isn’t the only game in town.
If you read about Google Docs in the previous chapters, you probably will not be surprised 
to learn that Google has an e-mail application and calendar application that are both free, easy 
to use, and unbelievably powerful.
The Contenders
Google’s e-mail application, Gmail, and Google Calendar are both completely free, and they 
might change the way you deal with e-mail and scheduling. Both applications are SaaS and 
available from any web browser, including mobile phone browsers, with Internet access.
Here, I’ll give you a brief overview of each application. Later in the chapter, I’ll show 
you some more sample tasks that are sure to convince you to give Gmail and Google Cal-
endar a try.
Gmail
Gmail is an online e-mail application that is offered as a free service by Google. You can access 
Gmail from any computer (or mobile phone) with Internet connectivity. It offers more storage 
space than most people will ever need: currently 7GB per user (and Google is always increas-
ing that number). Consider that most corporate e-mail administrators will cap employee inbox 
size at 2GB or 3GB. If you exceed your quota, you need to either erase messages or archive 
your old mail. In contrast, Gmail’s storage space is so big you can use it as file storage!
Gmail stores all of your active e-mail in the Inbox container, as shown in Figure 6-2. There 
are no folders. This can take some getting used to initially, but once you understand a bit more 
about Gmail’s capabilities, you won’t give it another thought.

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
104
Figure 6-2. Gmail displays your e-mail and shows how much storage space is available.
Gmail offers all the standard features you would expect in an e-mail application, such as 
the ability to send attachments, add a signature, and so on. You’ll also find a basic contacts 
tool that lets you store a contact’s e-mail address, phone number, and physical address infor-
mation, as well as a built-in instant messaging/chat application.
Google is constantly updating Gmail, adding a new feature or two just about monthly. You 
can enable or disable features to suit your preferences. In the “Gmail Features” section later 
in this chapter, I’ll show you how to view the optional features and enable those that you find 
interesting.
NTip Google’s programmers added a new feature just recently that feels like it was made just for me. I 
frequently forget to include an attachment with my messages. Gmail’s new Forgotten Attachment Detector 
now pops up an alert when it detects words such as attach, attachment, or attached in the text of a mes-
sage. Outlook doesn’t do that! The Forgotten Attachment Detector can be enabled from the Labs tab of the 
Gmail Settings screen (click the Settings link in the upper-right corner of the Gmail screen to display the 
Settings screen).
Using Gmail is easy, and most of its features are fairly intuitive. If you need assistance, just 
click the Help link in the upper-right corner of the screen (see Figure 6-2). Google provides 
help files as well as access to a special Gmail forum, where you can post questions and get 
answers from other Gmail users and sometimes even Google programmers. 

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
105
Google Calendar
I’m secretly addicted to Google Calendar. This amazing and free tool keeps this scatterbrained 
writer organized, informed, and on time for my daily appointments and deadlines. I can 
access my calendar from any computer whenever I like. I can access it from my mobile phone. 
It e-mails me reminders. Calendar lets me schedule new events by sending it text messages. 
It updates automatically with my favorite TV shows and sporting events. And it plays a mean 
game of Snake (available from Labs tab of the Settings screen, accessed by clicking the Settings 
link in the upper-right corner of the Gmail screen)!
Google Calendar is one of many Google applications that are available to you once you’re 
logged in to your Google account. Look along the top left-edge of the screen, and you’ll notice 
Gmail, Calendar, Documents, Photos, and more available as links, as shown in Figure 6-3. 
Clicking a link will open that Google tool in its own window or tab.
Figure 6-3. Google Calendar is one of many free Google applications.
Google Calendar allows you to view your calendar in various forms, including daily, 
weekly, and monthly views. You can create multiple calendars (such as a work calendar and 
a family calendar) and even make a calendar available for viewing by other Google users 
(such as a sports calendar for keeping up with your kids’ games and practices). There’s a lot 
of cool stuff you can do with a publicly shareable calendar that you might not have ever con-
sidered. For instance, I like to keep track of when MythBusters is on, so I can TiVo it or watch 
it with my son.
Google Calendar allows you to use multiple methods for entering new events in your cal-
endar. You can enter them using the keyboard, send them via a text message from your mobile 
phone, and even add them from within an e-mail. And Google Calendar has the same level of 
online help available as Gmail, if you should need it.
Where to Get the Software
Gmail and Google Calendar do not require you to install any software. Both applications are 
tied together, however, so you cannot use Calendar without a Gmail account.
Gmail
Gmail is a SaaS, so there’s no software to install. Follow these simple instructions to get started 
using it:
 
1. Visit dppl6++i]eh*ckkcha*_ki.
 
2. Click the Sign up for Gmail button.
 
3. Follow the instructions to create your Google account.
 
4. Once your account is created, log in to Gmail.

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
106
Google Calendar
There’s no software to install to use Google Calendar either. Follow these steps to access and 
use it:
 
1. Once you log in to Gmail, you can access Google Calendar by clicking the Calendar link 
along the top-left edge of the screen (see Figure 6-3). Calendar will open in its own win-
dow or tab.
 
2. If you’ve never used Google Calendar before, provide the additional information 
requested, and then click the Continue button to open the application.
Notes on Basic Usage
Gmail and Google Calendar are incredibly intuitive to use, but a lot of the neatest features are 
hidden away behind a clean “only-what-you-need-to-see” web interface. Here, we’ll take a 
look at some of the basics of using these applications. In the upcoming “E-mail and Calendar 
Features” section, we’ll explore some of the other interesting features available.
Gmail
If you’re familiar with Outlook or another e-mail application, using Gmail may feel a little 
strange at first, but its unique interface will quickly become easy for you to navigate and use.
Figure 6-4 shows the basic Gmail interface. On the top-left side of the screen is a Compose 
Mail link. I’ll give you two guesses as to what that link does for you. 
Figure 6-4. Google Mail has a unique user interface but it’s extremely easy to use.

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
107
Below the Compose Mail link is a list that includes Inbox, Starred, Chats, Sent Mail, Drafts, 
All Mail, Spam, and Trash links. For now, just think of these as folders that you can click to see 
what’s inside. Most of the labels are self-explanatory. Chats will keep an archive of any chat 
discussions you have. Starred will allow you to filter all your mail and display only those mes-
sages you have starred.
When you first open Gmail, your Inbox is selected, and any e-mail you have in the Inbox 
will be displayed. Notice that each e-mail message has a check box, a small star icon, the name 
of the sender, subject line (with a short preview of the first few words in each message), and 
the date or time of the e-mail.
The check box allows you to select a single message or multiple messages before perform-
ing an action (such as deleting messages or marking messages as unread). The check boxes are 
also handy when applying a label to multiple messages, as you’ll see in the “Gmail Features” 
section later in this chapter.
The star provides a nice visual reminder of important messages, for example. Click 
the star icon for e-mail that you want to mark (perhaps to follow up on later), and the star 
becomes a solid color, as shown in Figure 6-5. When you select the Starred link in the column 
on the left, only starred messages are displayed. 
NTip If you really enjoy the star feature, you can extend it. Gmail lets you add new shapes and colors. 
Click the Settings link in the upper-right corner of the Gmail screen, and then click the Labs tab. Look for the 
Superstars add-on. 
Figure 6-5. Stars are useful for marking important messages that you don’t want to forget.
To open a message, simply click it, and it will appear in full-window view, as shown in 
Figure 6-6. You can print the message, reply to it, delete it, and so on, as typically offered by 
e-mail applications. Also notice the Archive button at the top of the message window.

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
108
Figure 6-6. You have many options available to you after reading an e-mail message.
One of the containers that Gmail provides is All Mail. When you select Archive for an 
e-mail message, it goes into the All Mail list. Because Google gives you more than 7GB of 
e-mail storage space, this shouldn’t be a problem for most users. How many times have you 
deleted a message and then months (or years) later wished you could have it back? Well, with 
the Archive ability and the All Mail section, you can push that e-mail out of your Inbox but 
not worry about it being deleted. That said, the Delete button doesn’t really delete a message, 
but instead moves it to the Trash container. If you absolutely want to delete the e-mail in the 
Trash, click the Empty Trash now link (but use it with caution, because an e-mail deleted from 
the Trash is gone—period).
Also notice the Report Spam button. If you receive a piece of e-mail that is spam, click this 
button. The message will be moved to the Spam container, and that sender will be blocked 
from sending you any more e-mail. Additionally, Gmail’s own spam filter will be updated. 
NNote While Gmail’s spam filter will get rid of a large portion of spam you receive (it goes directly in the 
Spam container), it doesn’t always catch every spam message. Also, in some instances, a legitimate mes-
sage might be tagged as spam (by you or by Gmail). If you discover a message in the Spam container that 
isn’t spam, simply place a check next to it and click the Not Spam button. The message will be put in your 
Inbox. If you think you’ve missed an e-mail message, it can be worth it to troll through the Spam folder to see 
if Gmail kicked it there by accident.
Google Calendar
My best suggestion for using Google Calendar is to learn a few shortcut keys. What I mean 
is that navigating Google Calendar and adding events/appointments is as easy as pressing a 
single key on your keyboard.
First, learn how to change the view of your calendar (daily, weekly, or monthly are 
the most popular). Google Calendar couldn’t make this any easier. Just press the M key to 

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
109
change to monthly, W for weekly, and D for daily. If you don’t want to use your keyboard, 
you can change views by using the tabs along the upper-right edge of the window, as shown 
in Figure 6-7. 
Figure 6-7. Change your Calendar view to daily, weekly, monthly, or other layout.
I prefer the monthly view and will use this view for the remainder of this chapter’s Calen-
dar discussions. So, for now, press the M key or select the Month tab before continuing.
One of the most important things you’ll do with your calendar is add events. Google gives 
you two simple ways to add a new event to your calendar:
s #LICK THE DAY OR TIME TO ADD AN EVENT )N &IGURE  )VE CLICKED *ANUARY  AND ADDED
a new event called Truck Oil Change. Press the Enter key or click the Create Event but-
ton, and the event is created.
s #LICK THE 1UICK !DD LINK OR PRESS THE 1 KEY OR YOUR KEYBOARD 4HE 1UICK !DD BOX
appears, as shown in Figure 6-9, where you can enter a description, time, and even a 
date. Press the Enter key, and the event will be added to your Calendar.
Figure 6-8. Adding a new event is as simple as clicking a date in your Calendar.

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
110
Figure 6-9. The Quick Add feature allows you to specify exact details.
You can change the description of an event or add more details by clicking the event and 
selecting the “edit event details” link, as shown in Figure 6-10. This will open a new window 
that will allow you to make changes and configure reminders and other settings (I’ll cover the 
reminder and sharing options in the next section). When you’re finished, click the Save button.
Figure 6-10. Edit an event to provide more details such as time or location.

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
111
To delete an event, click the event and select the Delete link. Confirm that you wish to 
delete the event, and it will be removed from your Calendar. You can also drag and drop an 
event from one date to another (click the event description, hold down your mouse button, 
and drag it to another day).
Like Gmail, Google Calendar is easy to use, and most of the features are fairly intuitive. It’s 
hard to make a mistake in either tool, and assistance is just a click away using the Help link in 
the upper-right corner of both applications. 
E-Mail and Calendar Features
There are many things you can do using Gmail and Google Calendar. I’ll describe some of my 
favorites here. As you use these applications, you’ll find that there are dozens of other hidden 
gems. Gmail and Google Calendar are certainly worth getting to know!
Gmail Features
Gmail offers some powerful features that can help you handle your e-mail. Here, we’ll look at 
how to use Gmail labels, enable and disable options, and add a contact. 
Set Up and Use Labels
As you’ve seen, Gmail doesn’t use folders, as are used in Outlook and many other e-mail appli-
cations, but don’t let this dissuade you from trying it out. Gmail provides a feature called labels 
that, in my opinion, works even better. Here’s how to create and use labels with your Gmail 
messages:
 
1. From the Gmail screen, click the Edit labels link, as shown in Figure 6-11.
Figure 6-11. Click the Edit labels link to add a label.
 
2. Enter a description of the label, as shown in Figure 6-12, and then click the Create but-
ton. Create as many labels as you like. 
 
3. Return to your Inbox. Notice that your new label appears under the Labels section on 
the left. 

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
112
Figure 6-12. Enter a description for your label.
 
4. Place a check in the box next to a message you wish to label.
 
5. From the More Actions drop-down menu, select your new label, as shown in Fig-
ure 6-13. The message you checked will now contain the color-coded label, as shown 
in Figure 6-14.

113
Figure 6-14. Your label is added to the e-mail message, preceding the subject.
Create multiple labels and assign them to your messages. They make e-mail messages 
easier to pick out of your Inbox. Additionally, you can use each label as a filter (to view only 
those messages that contain that label) by clicking the label’s name, as shown in Figure 6-15.
Figure 6-15. Use labels to filter your messages.
You can edit your labels and change the name assigned to them by clicking the Edit labels 
link (see Figure 6-12).
View and Enable/Disable Special Options
Gmail offers many special options that you can turn on and off to suit your preferences. Follow 
these steps to view these options and turn enable or disable them:

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
114
 
1. Click the Settings link in the upper-right corner of the Gmail screen (refer back to 
Figure 6-4).
 
2. On the General tab, shown in Figure 6-16, you can add a signature, turn on and off a 
vacation notice, enable/disable keyboard shortcuts (useful for assigning special keys to 
common actions), set up Gmail to forward to another e-mail address, and more. 
Figure 6-16. The General tab of Gmail’s Settings screen has many special features you can use or 
ignore.
 
3. Click the Labs tab. This tab, shown in Figure 6-17, contains experimental features that 
Google allows you to enable or disable. Click the Learn more about Gmail Labs link if 
you need help or more information about a specific feature. Click the Enable or Disable 
radio button to turn on or off a feature. In the example in Figure 6-17, the Superstars 
feature is enabled. This gives you additional stars and colors to mark your messages. 
 
4. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Settings screen after making your 
selections.

Enable additional special features and experiment with them to determine if they make 
your Gmail experience more efficient or fun. Remember that you can always disable them if 
you don’t find them useful. 
NTip You might want to also investigate the Themes tab of the Gmail Settings screen, which can give your 
Gmail user interface an interesting new look. 
Add a Contact
Gmail isn’t going to be useful to you without some friends, family members, and work col-
leagues to receive e-mail. Follow these steps to start building your contact list:
 
1. Click the Contacts link in the Gmail screen (refer back to Figure 6-4). The contacts 
management screen will appear, as shown in Figure 6-19. 

CHAPTER 6 N  E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
117
NNote Gmail will automatically add anyone you e-mail to your Suggested Contacts list, so your list may or 
may not be empty at this point. However, only those people in your My Contacts list will show up on the con-
tact list in the screen shown in Figure 6-19. 
Figure 6-19. The contacts management screen 
 
2. To add a new contact, click the New Contact button, as shown in Figure 6-20. Enter 
information for that contact, and then click the Save button.
 
3. Your new contact will be added to the My Contacts list, as shown in Figure 6-21. Click 
the Add a picture link to browse and assign a photo of the contact. You can also click 
the Groups button to assign the contact to any special groups (or click New group to 
create a group and add this contact). If you later want to remove this contact, click the 
Delete contact button.

Your contacts will also be available from the main Gmail screen. Simply hover your mouse 
over the contact to see the options available. More features to investigate with your contacts 
include viewing Google Map directions to a contact, adding the contact to your Chat list, and 
viewing recent chat conversations. You can easily start a chat session from the main screen 
this way. (Some people leave the Gmail chat window open all day, as a type of mini-mailbox.)

Google Calendar Features
The real strength of Google Calendar lies in how easy it can make your life—maybe in ways 
you might never have considered! At its best, Google Calendar is like having a personal assis-
tant to keep your schedule.
Create an Appointment with Text Messaging
One of my favorite features of Google Calendar is the ability to add appointments even when 
I’m not sitting in front of a computer. 
If your mobile phone supports sending and receiving text messages, you can create a 
NEW #ALENDAR EVENT BY TEXTING A DESCRIPTION TIME AND DATE TO '6%.4 	 AS SHOWN IN
Figure 6-22. Google Calendar will send you a reply text message indicating the event was suc-
cessfully added. The next time you view Calendar, you will see the new event, as shown in 
Figure 6-23.

Receive Text Message Reminders on Your Mobile Phone
To receive reminders on your mobile phone, you must first enable Google to communi-
cate with your mobile phone. Here’s how to set up the communication and choose to get 
reminders:
 
1. Click the Settings link in the upper-right corner of the Google Calendar screen. 
 
2. In the Settings screen, click the Mobile Setup tab.
 
3. Select your country, enter your phone number, and select your Carrier from the drop-
down list. Then click the Send Verification Code button. 
 
4. The code will be sent to your mobile phone. Enter that code in the Mobile Setup 
tab. You will see a “Phone number successfully validated” message, as shown in 
Figure 6-24. Click the Save button.
Figure 6-24. The Mobile Setup tab allows you to set up your mobile phone to receive text message 
reminders.
 
5. Click an event on your calendar and select the “edit event details” link. 
 
6. The event’s details screen will open. In the Options section, select SMS from one of 
the reminder drop-down menus, as shown in Figure 6-25. (Alternatively, you can click 
the Add a reminder link to add Email as another option for notification, in addition to 
Pop-Up and SMS). Next, select minutes, hours, or days from the drop-down menu, and 
enter a specific numeric value. Click the Save button to enable the reminder.

mended) or with specific individuals. Enter the e-mail address of someone who will be 
allowed to view your calendar and select the permissions settings from the drop-down 
menu, as shown in Figure 6-27. (“See all event details” is recommended if you don’t 
want this person to be able to modify your calendar.) Click the Save button.

Although dozens of free e-mail and calendar applications are available, I simply cannot 
imagine using anything other than Gmail and Google Calendar. These two applications go 
hand-in-hand, and I highly encourage you to create a Google account and try them out.

Summary
Gmail and Google Calendar work great separately, but together they are a powerhouse com-
bination that can help you stay organized and in touch with friends, family, coworkers, and 
everyone else on the planet.
E-mail is here to stay—there’s no avoiding it if you wish to live and work and play in this 
modern world. And if you’re as busy as the next person, it’s nice to have a calendar applica-
tion to help you remember important dates like birthdays and anniversaries, super-important 
dates like that job interview, and not-so-important dates such as the original TV episode airing 
of Fringe.
Gmail and Google Calendar are two of my most valued computer applications. The fact 
that they’re both totally free to use makes me smile when I think about the money I’m saving 
and laugh when someone asks why I don’t use Outlook.

Photo Editing
It’s hard for me to imagine a time when I took pictures using rolls of film, but in reality, it 
was only about eight years ago that I purchased my first digital camera. I was able to take pic-
tures and have them stored on a small memory card that fit inside my camera. At the time, 
my memory card limited me to about 90 pictures, but that was still more than the standard 
24 exposures I could take using a single roll of film. Digital photography was definitely the 
way to go.
Today, buying a camera typically implies a digital camera. Sure, some professional pho-
tographers still use film, but for ease of use, you just can’t beat digital. Getting your pictures 
printed on paper is as easy as inserting the memory card into a store’s kiosk and selecting the 
photos you wish to purchase. Kiosks also offer options such as the ability to crop, add text, and 
remove red eye (the effect that sometimes results from a camera flash).
Along with the photo kiosks, plenty of online digital photo printers (such as oj]lbeod*_ki) 
are available. They will not only print your images and mail them to you, but they also offer 
custom services that let you add pictures to mouse pads, coffee mugs, calendars, and more 
items than you can imagine.
Owning a digital camera lets you capture all those special moments: your child’s first 
steps, that great vacation, and your first house. But a digital camera also helps with some 
more mundane tasks, such as providing an insurance company with photos of damage done 
to your vehicle by a negligent driver or taking pictures of the serial numbers on all your home 
electronics.
If you’re at all like me, you’ve been known to take a bad picture. Maybe the lighting was 
poor, with the sun behind your subject instead of in front. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to 
clean up some of those bad photos, saving them from deletion? 
Well, the good news is that there are numerous applications out there that allow you to 
modify and edit your digital photos. Some of these applications are extremely powerful and 
come with features that professional photographers have been known to charge huge amounts 
of money to provide. Other applications provide only a single feature (red-eye removal, for 
example) but do it well. 
In this chapter, I’ll introduce you to the two biggest names in digital photo editing. One is 
the industry standard and comes with the industry-standard price (hint: it’s high). The other is 
an open source hit that remains completely free.

The Defender
When it comes to digital photo editing, the leader of the pack belongs to Adobe. Adobe Photo-
shop is the product most professional photographers and graphic artists turn to for any kind of 
digital photo manipulation.
Photoshop has an interface similar to many popular applications, as shown in Figure 7-1. 
A toolbar along the left edge gives you access to tools to edit a photograph in the large workspace 
in the center of the application. Menus along the top provide additional options, including the 
ability to turn on and off additional windows and toolbars.
Figure 7-1. Adobe Photoshop is a popular digital photo editing application.
You won’t hear too many people who use Photoshop say that the application doesn’t 
have enough features. In fact, “Photoshop is just too complicated” is a frequent complaint. 
(A complete list of the features found in the latest version of Adobe Photoshop can be found 
at dppl6++sss*]`k^a*_ki+ldkpkodkl.)
Photoshop is certainly popular and powerful. There’s even a professional organization 
dedicated to the application. Check out the National Association of Photoshop Professionals 
(NAPP) web site at dppl6++sss*ldkpkodklqoan*_ki and learn about its annual Photoshop con-
ference held to discuss the application and provide training. For me, that’s a sure sign that this 
application goes a little beyond my basic needs.
Professional photographers and graphic artists are sure to appreciate the power of Photo-
shop, but the cost of Photoshop is just a bit too steep for the features that most of us will use.
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a lower-priced application that gives you the features of 
Photoshop if and when you want them, but also keeps the user interface simple and non-
intimidating? (And by lower priced, I mean free, of course.) Well, you’re in luck. A group of 
like-minded computer programmers decided to create an application that can compete, 
head-on, with Photoshop. And, because it’s open source, they’re giving it away.

The Contender
Whether you need to perform some simple edits to a digital photograph or do more complex 
cropping and cleanup work, you’re going to love GIMP. GIMP is an open source digital image 
editing application that is totally free to use.
One of the first things you’ll notice about GIMP is its slightly different user interface. 
When you open the application, you’ll see two separate windows, as shown in Figure 7-2. 
This may seem a little odd at first, but you’ll quickly adjust and understand why GIMP works 
as it does.
Figure 7-2. GIMP opens two simple windows when you first run the application.
Like Photoshop, GIMP is a powerful application in the hands of someone who knows how 
to properly use all its features. Entire books have been written on GIMP, and an abundance of 
web sites provide tutorials and examples of what can be done using this application. 

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
128
So, let’s get started. Up next, I’ll tell you where to get GIMP, explain how to install it, and 
then show you some simple tasks you can perform with this great application. Once you start 
using GIMP, you’ll begin to discover all sorts of useful (and sometimes strange) tweaks you 
can perform on your photos. See the “Investigate Further” section of this chapter for my rec-
ommendations for online help and resources when you’re ready to dig deeper into GIMP’s 
collection of amazing abilities.
Where to Get the Software
You’ll need to download a software installation file that will be used to install GIMP on your 
computer. To get the software, perform the following steps:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*ceil*knc.
 
2. Click the Download button near the top of the screen.
 
3. Locate the version of GIMP that matches your operating system. For Windows, there is 
a single installation file. (As I write this chapter, the latest version is 2.6.4 and there is a 
link labeled Download GIMP 2.6.4, but download the latest version available.)
NNote Is GIMP completely free? Yes. There are no advertisements in the software, and you’ll see no 
pop-ups asking you to upgrade or buy a premium edition. If you like the application and want to show 
your support of the project, you can make a tax-deductible donation by visiting dppl6++sss*ceil*knc+
`kj]pejc+ and clicking the Make a Donation button or by sending a check to the address provided.
Notes on GIMP Installation
Installing GIMP is extremely simple. Double-click the installation file you downloaded and, 
after reading through and accepting the license agreement, click the Install now button to 
begin the installation process. 
When the installation wizard finishes, you’ll find a GIMP shortcut icon on your desktop. 
Double-click the icon to open and begin using GIMP. (You can also delete the desktop icon 
and open GIMP by selecting it from the Start menu.)

Basic GIMP Tasks
To really take advantage of GIMP, you need to have a basic understanding of something called 
a layer. Once you understand layers and how they work, you’ll be able to do some amazing 
things using GIMP.
Layers are not actually that complicated. Just imagine a stack of magazines on the floor, as 
shown in Figure 7-3. 
Figure 7-3. A stack of magazines is a perfect example of how layers work.
Notice that the magazine on top of the stack is completely visible—none of the words or 
images are hidden. The magazines below it, however, are partially obscured. You can make 
out the name of one of the magazines and see a glimpse of the cover on another one, but that 
top magazine (or top layer) is the only one in the stack that is totally viewable.
I don’t want to take up all my floor space, but I would like to be able to glance down and 
see the titles of my magazines, so I’ll reorder the stack (layers), as shown in Figure 7-4.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
130
Figure 7-4. I can rearrange the layers to see more (or less) of each magazine.
Now that I can see my magazine titles, I’m going to throw some more items on top of the 
stack: a couple of business cards and some sticky notes, as shown in Figure 7-5.
But now I realize that the most current issue of one of my magazines is at the very bot-
tom of the stack. It’s a simple matter to move that magazine up to the top of the stack (but 
below the business cards and sticky notes). Now that all the layers on the floor of my office are 
organized the way I like them, I move the business cards and sticky notes around a bit so I can 
see more of the magazine layer beneath them. Figure 7-6 shows how I finally organized all the 
layers in my stack.
If you’re wondering what all this has to do with GIMP, let me explain by walking you 
through a typical activity using GIMP: adding some text to a digital photo. 

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
131
Figure 7-5. My layers are a mixture of magazines, cards, and notes.
Figure 7-6. All the layers in my stack are ordered and positioned as I prefer them.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
132
Add Text to a Photo
In this example, I’ll show you how to create a customized digital photo that you can e-mail to 
various friends and family. We’ll add some text that will not change from photo to photo, as 
well as some other text that will be a personal message to the recipient. 
To begin, open GIMP by double-clicking the desktop shortcut or selecting it from your 
Start menu. When GIMP opens, you’ll see a couple of windows (see Figure 7-2).
Now, follow along with the procedure, and the concept of layers will begin to make sense.
 
1. Drag and expand the windows to give yourself some more working room. Figure 7-7 
shows how I’ve expanded the workspace window on the right.
Figure 7-7. Expand the GIMP windows to give yourself more working room.
 
2. To open the digital photo you wish to edit, select File ° Open, as shown in Figure 7-8. 
In the dialog box that appears, browse to the location of the photo you wish to edit, 
select it, and click the Open button.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
133
Figure 7-8. Open a digital photo that you wish to edit.
 
 Your photo will open and appear on the workspace, as shown in Figure 7-9. Just as in 
my stack of magazines, this photo is the first item in my stack, and currently the only 
item. Because we want to add some text to this photo, the text will need to be placed 
on top of the photo, correct? To do this, we need to add a layer; that is, the text must be 
added to the top of the stack. 
NNote Think of everything you wish to add to a digital photo as an item. That item will go above or below 
your photo. If it’s above it, it can obscure the entire photo or just part of it. If the item is below the photo, the 
photo will most likely obscure the entire item.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
134
Figure 7-9. Your digital photo will open in the workspace, where you will perform your edits.
 
3. Select Windows ° Dockable Dialogs, and then select Layers, as shown in Figure 7-10. 
 
 The Layers window will appear, as shown in Figure 7-11. The layer at the top of the list 
in this window is equivalent to the item at the top of a stack. It will sit on top of any lay-
ers below it. In this example, there is currently only one layer, named Background. The 
Background layer will typically be the photo you are opening to edit.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
135
Figure 7-10. Open the Layers window to view all the layers you’ve added to the stack.
Figure 7-11. The Layers window shows all the layers in your stack and their order.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
136
 
4. To work with a layer, click it in the Layers window. In the list, the layer will turn blue, 
indicating it is the layer you are currently working on. (In Figure 7-11, the Background 
layer is selected.) 
 
5. Drag the Layer window to the right of your workspace and expand it a little, as shown 
in Figure 7-12. Now you can view the tools in the left window, your workspace in the 
center window, and your layers in the right window. 
Figure 7-12. I organize GIMP with the Toolbox window on the left, workspace in the middle, and 
Layers window on the right.
 
6. To add text, select the Text tool (the tool button with the large A) in the Toolbox win-
dow and click in the photo where you wish to place the text.
 
7. Type the text you wish to add. Then you can use the Text options in the lower part of 
the Toolbox window to format the text. As shown in Figure 7-13, I’ve added my greet-
ing in the upper-left corner of the photo and changed the color, font, and font size of 
the text. 
 
 Notice that after you’ve added the text, a new layer is added in the Layer window, as 
shown in Figure 7-14. The layer has the name of the text you added and appears at the 
top of the layer stack. So, when you add an element (such as a shape or text) to your 
photo, GIMP automatically creates a layer for you. 

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
137
Figure 7-13. Use the Text tool to add your text and modify the font, font size, and color 
as desired.
Figure 7-14. The text that you added exists in its own layer.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
138
 
8. Layers can be moved up and down the stack easily. Try it. Click your text layer and, 
while holding down the mouse button, drag it down the stack. Release the button when 
the layer is where you wish to place it in the stack. Figure 7-15 shows that the new text 
layer is now below the Background layer. It looks like the text disappeared! Because the 
photo takes up the entire screen, it is essentially covering the text, making it invisible. 
Now, drag the text layer back to the top,
Figure 7-15. Moving layers up and down will change what is visible in the workspace.
 
9. Next, let’s add a personal message. Once again, select the Text tool and add the text 
for that message where you want it to appear. In Figure 7-16, I’ve added a message to 
my parents. Notice that a new layer appears at the very top in the Layers window. I’ve 
placed this new message so that it slightly covers the other text layer.
 
10. Because the new message is the topmost layer, it appears on top of the original greet-
ing text. Drag this top layer down one level in the stack and drop it under the greeting 
layer. You’ll see that the text changes places, as shown in Figure 7-17. The greeting is 
now sitting on top of the personal message.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
139
Figure 7-16. Adding another item (more text, in this case), adds another layer.
Figure 7-17. Swapping the top two layers doesn’t improve the readability.
 
11. Drag the personal message text to the lower-right corner. As shown in Figure 7-18, now 
both messages can be read. In this arrangement, it doesn’t really matter which text 
layer is on top.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
140
Figure 7-18. Move text items around in their respective layers until the image is acceptable.
 
 So, why not just put all the text on the same layer? Well, you could do that, but separat-
ing the text into two different layers allows you to make changes to one layer without 
altering any work done in another layer. Let’s see how that works.
 
12. To save this first image and text, select File ° Save As and give the file a name.
 
13. Click the personal message layer and change it, as shown in Figure 7-19. The greeting 
stays in place, as does the original photo. Now you can continue to change the personal 
message, so you have a personalized image to e-mail to each person.
Layers are powerful. You can move them up and down the stack, delete them, copy 
them, and more. Now that you understand how layers work, let’s look at another fun thing to 
do with GIMP.
NTip If you’re interested in learning more about the use of layers, I highly recommend Beginning GIMP, 
Second Edition, by Akkana Peck (Apress, 2009). This book goes into great detail and provides many exam-
ples of the power of layers.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
141

Drop Someone into a Photo
With GIMP, it’s easy to clip items out of one photo and put them into another. This is a use-
ful for placing an absent family member into a family photo, or for inserting a friend into a 
humorous photo (just don’t use it to place anyone at the scene of a crime or in a compromis-
ing situation!). 
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Open a photo containing the person you wish to clip out, as shown in Figure 7-20. In 
this example, I want to clip the little sleeping fellow on the couch and place him some-
where more interesting.
 
2. Click the Scissors tool in the Toolbox window, as shown in Figure 7-21. 

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
142
Figure 7-20. The first step is to open the photo that contains the item you want to clip out.
Figure 7-21. The Scissors tool will let you cut out a person or object in a digital photo.
 
3. Click anywhere on the edge of the person (or object) you wish to clip out. Figure 7-22 
shows that I’ve clicked the edge of the subject’s ear, indicated by a small colored dot.

CHAPTER 7 N  PHOTO EDITING
143
Figure 7-22. Start by clicking a spot along the edge of the person or object using the 
Scissors tool. 
 
4. Using your mouse, click points around the edge of the person or item. GIMP does a 
good job of examining the surrounding image and connecting the dots around the sub-
ject. Figure 7-23 shows my progress as I click around the sleeping figure.
Figure 7-23. You must select points along the edge of the person or object using the Scissors tool.
 
5. As you near the completion of surrounding the subject using the Scissors tool, click the 
original starting point (see Figure 7-22), and then click inside the area you’ve defined. 
The dots and connecting lines will change to an animated line (called marching ants) 
to indicate the item that has been selected to be clipped, as shown in Figure 7-24.

6. Select Edit ° Cut. Figure 7-25 shows that the subject has been successfully removed 
from the original photo.

7. Select File ° Open as Layers, as shown in Figure 7-26. From the dialog box, choose the 
photo in which you wish to place the clipped person or object.
Figure 7-26. Open a new digital photo as a layer.
 
8. The digital photo you selected will be added as a layer above the Background layer, as 
shown in Figure 7-27. Also, notice that the marching ants line appears superimposed 
over this layer, showing where the image will appear when you paste it. But there’s one 
more step to perform before putting the clipped subject back into the photo.
 
9. Adding a new layer will allow you to paste in the clipped subject, resize it, and move 
it around without affecting the layers below it. To do this, select Layer ° New Layer. 
Figure 7-28 shows the new layer, which I named Subject.

11. Select Edit ° Paste. The outline of the clipped subject will appear, as shown in 
Figure 7-29.
Figure 7-29. The clipped subject is back but needs to be resized and placed in a better location.
 
12. Right-click inside the clipped image, click Layer, and then select Scale Layer, as shown 
in Figure 7-30.
 
13. In the Scale Layer dialog box, make sure that percent is selected from the top drop-
down list, and then type in a number (such as 80 for 80%) in the Width and Height 
fields, as shown in Figure 7-31. Then click the Scale button. You may need to experi-
ment with the percentage value until you’re satisfied with the final size.

14. Click the clipped subject, hold down the mouse button, and drag it to a different loca-
tion. Figure 7-32 shows the final image with the sleeping boy reduced slightly in size 
and placed behind his birthday cake.

This is just one of the many fun effects you can add to digital photos with GIMP. An abun-
dance of possibilities exist for editing your photos with this extremely powerful application.
NNote GIMP can also do things such as remove red eye or improve images that are overexposed. However, 
such fixes are much easier to perform with Picasa, as you’ll learn in Chapter 13.
Investigate Further
Entire books and web sites are dedicated to GIMP. For starters, I highly recommend the same 
book I read, cover to cover, when I was learning this application: Beginning GIMP by Akkana 
Peck (Apress, 2006), which has been recently updated in a second edition (Apress, 2009).

You’ll find a ton of tutorials at the Tutorials site. And the online discussion forums are 
great places to post questions if you’re trying to figure out how to do something unusual or 
possibly complicated.
Summary
A few months ago, I participated in a group photo that had more than 100 people in it. One 
of the group members (Frank) was late and disappointed that he didn’t make it into the 
photo. But we didn’t need to leave him out. I asked him to stand approximately where the 
group was standing when the photo was taken and snapped a photo with only Frank in the 
image. I was able to use GIMP to clip him from the second photo and place him (well, just 
his shoulders and head) in the original photo. After the group photo was printed, no one 
could tell the difference.
GIMP is a fun tool. You may find it as addictive as I do for adding special effects and text to 
photos.
The developers of GIMP never stop working to improve the product; they are always add-
ing new features and effects. GIMP is one of the rare open source applications that may have 
exceeded the big name, pay-to-use applications in terms of ease of use and functionality. Give 
it a spin. Visit some of the online resources I suggested in this chapter. I think you’ll agree that 
this 100% free photo editing application is one outstanding tool.

Graphics
I am not embarrassed to admit that I cannot draw. My stick figures are horrible, with mis-
matched arm lengths, feet pointing in the wrong directions, and oversized heads that no neck 
could possibly support. I may be the only person in the world who cannot draw a symmetrical 
five-pointed star.
But all that changed when I began to use my computer to assist me with creating simple 
geometric shapes and ensuring that symmetry exists where it’s needed. Suddenly, I could 
draw perfect squares, circles, and stars. My hand drawings typically still look like the crayon 
masterpieces of a two-year-old, but the graphics I create using my computer are starting to 
show promise.
Graphics applications have come a long way since the dawn of computers. Early pro-
grams provided you with a virtual pen and allowed you to change only the color of the ink 
and thickness of the virtual pen’s tip. Later versions included functionality such as adding 
basic (and perfect) shapes, as well as features such as textures and the ability to copy, rotate, 
and resize objects.
Today, graphic design applications allow artists to do things with their art that would have 
been impossible—or at least extremely difficult and time-consuming—only a few years ago. 
These abilities include morphing, blending textures, adding metal/chrome effects, and more.
Graphics applications are similar to photo editing applications (discussed in Chapter 7). 
You can import digital photos and modify them in an infinite number of ways. But these 
graphics programs have the added benefit of allowing you to create something from nothing 
on the “canvas” (the blank screen). While these applications have typically been out of reach 
of the typical computer user—usable only by the highly skilled graphic artist—that is chang-
ing. Today, there are graphics applications that are user-friendly but don’t skimp on features. 
This chapter introduces you to two of them. One is Adobe Illustrator, which is likely to be 
found on every professional graphic artist’s computer and comes with a professional price. 
The other is Inkscape, which can easily be downloaded and installed on your computer, and 
comes with a price you’ll love: free.
The Defender
As a writer, I frequently work with graphic artists. While I’m writing the words that will appear 
on a web site, in a brochure, or in a book, the graphic artist is concerned with creating the eye-
catching images, icons, and layout that share the page with my text. When I inquire about the 
application the artist is using, the answer I get almost every time is Adobe Illustrator.
Adobe Illustrator, shown in Figure 8-1, seems to be the application of choice for most 
professional digital artists. It’s a powerful application, with tools and options that I have 
151

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
152
absolutely no clue how to use (or even what they do). But my graphic artist friends tell me that 
they use feature x every week and feature y once a month, and can’t live without them. With 
Illustrator, an artist can create original art as well as modify existing items. 
Figure 8-1. Adobe Illustrator is the professional graphic artist’s application of choice.
Whether you’re using a mouse or a specialized tool such as a tablet with a digital pen (see 
Figure 8-2), Illustrator provides a collection of tools such as brush shapes, textures, and colors 
to create graphics. Another collection of features can be used to twist, tweak, distort, blend, 
shrink, and so on. If you can envision what you want to do to an image or photo, Illustrator can 
probably make it a visual reality. (A complete list of the features found in the latest version of 
Adobe Illustrator can be found at dppl6++sss*]`k^a*_ki+ehhqopn]pkn.)

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
153
Figure 8-2. Many graphic artists use a digital pen and tablet instead of a mouse.
At its heart, however, Illustrator is a vector graphics application. What does that mean? 
Well, there’s a complicated definition that I’ll spare you. Instead, I’ll give you a simple explana-
tion using the few simple elements shown in Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3. The difference between vector graphics and standard bitmap graphics

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
154
For most graphics, when you enlarge or shrink an item, you get a distorted image. It 
is most noticeable when enlarging a photo or graphic. Figure 8-3 shows a simple graphic 
image in the upper-left corner created using Microsoft’s Paint program and saved as a bit-
map (*^il) file. The lower-left corner shows that same graphic image after I’ve enlarged it by 
100%. Doubling it in size has ruined the smooth edges of the original circle. In the upper-right 
corner, I’ve drawn another simple image using a vector graphics application and enlarged it in 
the lower-right corner. Can you see the difference?
NNote Some typical graphic image file formats are bitmap and JPEG. Bitmaps are uncompressed image 
files with a *^il extension. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group format. JPEGs are compressed 
images.
The large smiley face looks jagged and has lost all its smooth edges. This is called pixel-
ation and occurs when you resize images in most standard graphics applications. It happens 
because the application is simply unable to determine what must be added to the original 
image (or taken away) in order for the proportions, colors, and other qualities to appear 
properly in the new size.
A vector graphics application doesn’t suffer from this problem. These types of applica-
tions use a type of math, called vector math, to assist in keeping the qualities of a modified 
graphic the same as the image is enlarged, shrunk, or otherwise modified. It’s complicated, 
but all you really need to know is that the vector graphics you create can be easily modified 
without pixelation. 
Vector graphics are drawn with lines that can be redrawn to different scales. Bitmap 
graphics are laid down as collections of bits that the computer no longer can recognize as 
lines and circles and such. When you resize a vector graphic, the computer redraws all the 
lines. When you resize a bitmap, the computer must expand the number of pixels with-
out knowing what each pixel represents in the image, and the enlarged bitmap image gets 
that jagged look. (If you wish to learn more about vector graphics and how they work, visit 
dppl6++aj*segela`e]*knc+sege+Ra_pkn[cn]lde_o.)
I’ve seen some amazing artwork created using Illustrator. However, Illustrator’s price 
is simply out of range for most computer users. I occasionally need to create some original 
graphics for presentations or chapters (such as Figure 8-3), but that doesn’t warrant my pur-
chasing Illustrator. I needed to find a vector graphics application that has many or all of the 
standard graphic tools available in Illustrator, but at a much-reduced price. Let me tell you 
what I found during my search.

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
155
GIMP OR INKSCAPE?
Both GIMP (covered in Chapter 7) and Inkscape are capable of working with photos, and both applications can 
also be used to create original graphic art. Each application has a collection of tools that allow you to draw 
lines, add shapes, change colors, and more. So, do you really need both? Maybe.
GIMP has much more powerful capabilities for photo editing than Inkscape, including a multitude of 
effects that can be applied to photos, including lighting changes and texture formatting (such as changing 
a photo to look as if it were painted or drawn using pen or pencil). However, GIMP is not a vector graphics 
application. It can enlarge and shrink photos to a point, but there are limits that, when reached, will cause 
photo distortion.
While Inkscape can import photos and has a variety of tools to modify them, it lacks the photo manipula-
tion controls of GIMP. Its ideal use is for creating original graphics (as well as adding them to photos) that can 
be enlarged and shrunk with no visible distortion.
In a nutshell, use GIMP when doing any type of work on digital photographs (or other image files) and 
GIMP when you need to create some original artwork. For something in between, use the application that you 
find has the most comfortable interface and that you enjoy.
The Contender
Say hello to Inkscape, a 100% free, open source, vector graphics application that is extremely 
easy to download, install, and use. Inkscape comes with a ton of online support, tutorials, and 
even a free online book.
Inkscape has a clean, uncluttered user interface. Tools are found along the left and top 
edges of the screen. The workspace is in the center, menus along the top, and color selections 
along the bottom edge. Figure 8-4 shows that my default workspace is an 8.5  11-inch docu-
ment with a white background, but I can change that easily enough (as you’ll see in the “Adjust 
Your Screen Settings” section later in this chapter).
As a vector graphics application, Inkscape allows you to design new images (or modify 
existing ones) without losing visual quality as you shrink, enlarge, and perform modifications. 
Whereas Illustrator saves files using the file type *]e, Inkscape’s developers elected to have 
their application save files using the *orc file type. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a specifi-
cation being developed as an industry standard for graphics applications. Among other things, 
this specification defines the standards for certain types of graphic files, including making 
certain the graphics are compatible with as many graphics applications as possible. Illustrator 
supports the *orc format, so images created in Illustrator and saved using the *orc file type 
can be opened and modified using Inkscape and vice versa.
Inkscape is evolving, and its developers are committed to improving this open source 
application, adding new features while still making it available for free distribution and use. 
The remainder of this chapter will show you where to get the software, how to install it, and 
how to perform some basic functions using this outstanding vector graphics application.

Where to Get the Software
You’ll need to download a software installation file that will be used to install Inkscape on your 
computer. To get the software, perform the following steps:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*ejgo_]la*knc+.
 
2. Click Download in the list in the column on the left side of the screen.
 
3. Look under the Official Release section and download the latest version of Inkscape by 
clicking the link that corresponds to your operating system. (As I write this chapter, the 
current version is 0.46). 
NNote Why isn’t the current version of Inkscape 1.0? The Inkscape development team has decided that 
the 1.0 status will not be awarded until certain key features are implemented in the application. One of the 
most important implementations the team is working toward is 100% compatibility with the SVG 1.1 industry 
specification. Inkscape is feature-packed, and its current version is 100% usable and stable for the typical 
computer user.

Notes on Inkscape Installation
To install Inkscape, double-click the installation file you downloaded and follow the on-screen 
instructions. When you are given the opportunity to check or uncheck components for instal-
lation, uncheck the Translations box, and only the English translation will be installed. This 
will save you approximately 45MB of hard drive space, and Inkscape’s installation will take up 
170MB. But if you wish to install any other languages for Inkscape, place a check in the box 
besides the language(s) you wish to include.
Basic Inkscape Tasks
To use Inkscape, you’ll need a basic understanding of the various tools available in the appli-
cation. I encourage you to consult the online documentation and tutorials mentioned in the 
“Investigate Further” section of this chapter to learn more about the application. Here, I’ll 
show you how to perform some basic tasks to introduce you to how Inkscape works. 
To get started, double-click the Inkscape icon on your desktop (or select it from the 
Start menu).
Adjust Your Screen Settings
When you first open Inkscape, your screen opens with some default settings such as using 
pixels (instead of inches or millimeters) and the A4 paper format (instead of Legal or Letter). 
The default setting of A4 is an odd paper format used in European countries, not in the United 
States, and measurement in inches (or millimeters) is easier to visualize than pixels. Also, 
the default workspace size is quite small (see Figure 8-4). Here’s how you can change these 
settings:
 
1. Select File ° Document Properties. The Document Properties window will open.
 
2. On the Page tab, select your desired paper size from the Format section. Choose Land-
scape or Portrait orientation. Select your default units from the drop-down menu at the 
top of the window, or enter a custom size for your document in the Custom size sec-
tion. Figure 8-5 shows that I’ve selected inches (in) and a landscape orientation for my 
letter-size workspace. The changes are made automatically as you select them. Click 
the Close button when you’re finished.
 
3. To enlarge the workspace, select View ° Zoom and select Page from the fly-out menu, 
as shown in Figure 8-6. Your workspace will expand to almost full-screen size, allowing 
you to see more details in your drawing.

Add Basic Shapes
Before you can walk, you must learn to crawl, right? Learn to add simple shapes like squares 
and circles by following these steps:
 
1. Select the Rectangle tool (see Figure 8-4), and then click in the workspace where you 
wish to place a corner of the rectangle while holding down the mouse button. Drag the 
mouse, and you’ll see your rectangle grow (or shrink) as you move the mouse around. 
Release the mouse when you’re satisfied with the rectangle’s size. The rectangle will be 
added to the workspace, as shown in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7. Drawing rectangles is simple using Inkscape’s Rectangle tool.
 
2. To make a perfect square, use the Rectangle tool, as in step 1, but hold down the Ctrl 
and Shift keys while dragging the mouse. The sides will be kept to an identical size, 
allowing you to create a square, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
3. Select the Circle tool (see Figure 8-4), and then click in the workspace while holding 
down the mouse. Drag the mouse around the screen, and you’ll see your oval shape 
form. Release the mouse, and your final shape will be added to the drawing, as shown 
in Figure 8-9.

Figure 8-8. Drawing squares is also easy when you use the Ctrl+Shift-drag technique.
Figure 8-9. Draw round shapes using the Circle tool.

4. To create a perfect circle, use the Circle tool as in step 3, but hold down the Ctrl and 
Shift keys while dragging the mouse. Release the mouse button to complete the circle, 
as shown in Figure 8-10.
Figure 8-10. The Ctrl+Shift-drag technique creates a perfect circle.
 
5. Notice the small squares and circles on the dotted line surrounding the shapes you 
draw. These appear when the shape is selected. Try clicking and dragging them 
around. This is how you can modify the shape of the selected item. 
 
6. Click one of your shapes, and then click a color in the color bar at the bottom of the 
screen. This changes the color of the item.
Free Drawing
Sometimes you don’t need a standard shape like a circle or square. Free drawing options such 
as the Freehand Line tool, Bezier Curve tool, and Brush Stroke tool are fun to use and give you 
the ability to create some interesting shapes, lines, and other effects. Try these steps:

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
162
 
1. Select the Freehand Line tool (see Figure 8-11). Click and hold down the mouse button 
as you drag the tool on the workspace. It works just like a pen or pencil. In Figure 8-11, 
I’ve used this tool to write “Inkscape” on the rectangle. 
NNote With a mouse, the Freehand Line tool doesn’t provide the nicest looking results. With a tablet (like 
the one shown in Figure 8-2), the tool will give better results.
Figure 8-11. Use the Freehand Line tool to draw or write on the workspace.
 
2. Select the Bezier Curve tool (see Figure 8-12). Click in your workspace where you wish 
to place one end of a curve, as shown in Figure 8-12. Don’t release the mouse button.
 
3. While still holding down the mouse button, drag to different point on the workspace. 
Then release the mouse button. This will create the second point of your line. Fig-
ure 8-13 shows the second point placed.

Figure 8-13. The second point created by the Bezier Curve tool defines the length of the curve.

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
164
 
4. Drag your mouse around (do not click), and you should see a curve take shape. Con-
tinue to move the mouse around until the curve is acceptable, and then double-click. 
Your curve will be created, as shown in Figure 8-14. 
Figure 8-14. The final curve created by the Bezier Curve tool
 
5. Select the Brush Stroke tool (see Figure 8-15). Click in the workspace and hold the 
mouse button while dragging. The results are nicer than with the Freehand Line tool, 
as shown in Figure 8-15. You can use this tool to add some calligraphy or nice flour-
ishes to your drawing.

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
165
Figure 8-15. The Brush Stroke tool creates eye-catching flourishes.
Use Layers
Like the GIMP application covered in Chapter 7, Inkscape uses layers. Layers allow you to work 
on an individual element or collection of elements—image, shape, text, and so on—without 
worrying about deleting, erasing, or otherwise changing any other elements. Layers are a vir-
tual “stack,” allowing you to work only on elements stored on a single layer without changing 
any other layers. Refer to Chapter 7’s discussion of layers (in the “Basic GIMP Tasks” section) 
for more details.
To view and edit any layers currently being used in Inkscape, perform the following steps:
 
1. Select Layer ° Layers, as shown in Figure 8-16. The Layers window will appear along 
the left edge of the Inkscape screen, as shown in Figure 8-17. In this example, only one 
layer (named Layer 1) currently exists.
 
2. Click the + button in the Layers window to add a new layer. 

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS

Figure 8-16. Select Layers from the Layer menu to open the Layers window. 
Figure 8-17. The Layers window takes up little space but is a very useful tool to get to know.

CHAPTER 8 N  GRAPHICS
167
 
3. In the Add Layer dialog box, give your layer a name, as shown in Figure 8-18, and then 
click the Add button. In this example, I’ve created a new layer named Background that 
will appear above the existing layer. 
Figure 8-18. Creating new layers is easy using the Add Layer dialog box.
 
4. In the Layers window, click the new layer to select it. Now, anything you draw in this 
new layer will sit above Layer 1 and cover any items below it. Add a shape of your 
choice here. Figure 8-19 shows a large colored rectangle that I’ve drawn on the Back-
ground layer. Notice that it covers most of Layer 1.
Figure 8-19. Click a layer to select it and then draw on it.
 
5. To move the new layer (Background in this example) below the existing one (Layer 
1), select that layer in the Layers window and click the down-pointing arrow button, 
as shown in Figure 8-20. (The other buttons in the Layers window allow you to raise a 
layer all the way to the top, lower a layer all the way to the bottom, delete a layer, and 
raise a layer up one level.) The Background layer is now underneath Layer 1. In the 
example in Figure 8-21, all of the elements from Figure 8-15 now sit on top of the large 
rectangle I added to the Background layer.

Perform Other Drawing Tasks
As you experiment with Inkscape, you’ll find many other things you can do. The following 
are some quick instructions for a few more basic tasks. Refer back to Figure 8-4 for the tool 
locations.
s #LICK THE 4EXT TOOL to add text to your drawing. You have control over the font, font size, 
and color of your text.
s #LICK THE 0OLYGONS TOOL to add stars and other interesting shapes to your drawing.

s &ROM THE /BJECT MENU, you can select options that will allow you to rotate selected 
items and flip them horizontally and vertically.
s 3ELECT /BJECT ° Transform. From the window that opens, you can make very subtle 
changes in the location and size of any selected object. 
Investigate Further
Sometimes, open source software suffers from a lack of documentation. Books and online 
tutorials tend to come later, once the application has gained in popularity. The Inkscape 
developers had an interesting solution to this problem. In July 2008, contributors from the 
United States, Australia, France, Netherlands, and Russia held a “book sprint” (a manual is 
written quickly by more than one individual). The project was funded by Google. The group 
members were asked to provide a minimum of 14 chapters. They wrote 35 chapters. The man-
ual is freely available at dppl6++aj*bhkooi]jq]ho*jap+ejgo_]la, and it’s a great place to start 
for some more advanced training with this great application.
Along with the free online manual, the following are a few more useful online resources:
s )NKSCAPE WIKI dppl6++sege*ejgo_]la*knc+sege+ej`at*ldl+Ejgo_]la
s )NKSCAPE TUTORIALS dppl6++ejgo_]lapqpkne]ho*skn`lnaoo*_ki+
s )NKSCAPE FORUM dppl6++sss*ejgo_]labknqi*_ki+
Inkscape is really in its infancy. The developers are committed to improving the applica-
tion and adding new features, while keeping it open source and totally free. If you like the 
application, join the Inkscape forum and let them know. You can also post requests for tutori-
als, ask questions (and provide answers), and suggest new features to be added. 
Summary
My wife got me a tablet and digital pen for my birthday, so I’m having fun using Inkscape. One 
of the first things I did was to create a small graphic that contains my signature. I can add that 
graphic to letters and other documents. Next, I’m going to try to create a mascot of sorts for my 
company. I’ve got some ideas, and Inkscape is just the tool to help me put them on the page.
A good graphics application will always come in handy for the nonprofessional artist. 
Whether you need to create a flyer for a business event or a school sports activity announce-
ment, Inkscape can help you add some eye-catching color and graphics to otherwise boring text. 
And if you’re in any kind of profession or role that requires you to occasionally (or fre-
quently) draw or create graphics, Inkscape can potentially save you a lot of money. It’s worth 
investigating this free application before spending any funds on a big-name graphics appli-
cation. You might be surprised to find that Inkscape provides a nice collection of tools and 
effects that can handle all your graphic design needs.

Virus Protection
It’s an unfortunate truth that your computer is always under attack from individuals who wish 
to damage your hardware, corrupt your software, and delete your files. 
During the 1970s, the term hacker was a positive one, referring to someone who enjoyed 
tweaking and modifying hardware and software to do interesting (and legal) things. By the 
1980s, however, the meaning of hacker changed to refer to someone who uses a computer’s 
hardware and software to perform malicious activities.
Of all the methods used by these bad guys, none has been worse than the digital computer 
virus. Like a biological virus, a computer virus spreads through contact, can cause damage 
(but not always), and can be difficult to remove. The first known virus attacks began back 
in the early 1980s and continue to occur today. They target everyone who uses a computer, 
including you.
Your computer can pick up a virus by opening an infected file that was downloaded over 
the Internet or maybe a file included on a CD that someone gave you. Viruses can infect Word 
and spreadsheet files, applications, and even your operating system. When your computer is 
infected, it can run slower, programs can crash, and your files can be corrupted and unread-
able or even deleted. Many infected computers must have their operating system completely 
reinstalled, all the applications reinstalled, and the data files restored to the hard drive. 
Besides the monetary costs involved in restoring your computer to a working state after it 
has been infected by a virus, there is also the issue of time. It can take hours—even days—to 
properly reinstall and reconfigure your computer’s software. And then there’s the cost (in both 
time and money) to restore an individual or company’s reputation. Viruses are a scourge to 
computer users everywhere.
Fortunately, the easiest method for protecting yourself from the damage and hassles that 
viruses can cause involves three simple steps (which are covered in this chapter):
 
1. Install an antivirus application on your computer.
 
2. Configure the antivirus application to perform scheduled scans and download updates.
 
3. Use the antivirus program to scan any files downloaded to your computer.
I recommend dozens of programs in this book, but if you’re going to install only one, 
make that an antivirus application. New viruses appear almost daily, so even if you’re already 
using an antivirus application, you need to make certain that its virus database is being 
updated regularly. This usually involves downloading a file that informs your antivirus pro-
gram about the latest viruses that have popped up.
In this chapter, we’ll look at two antivirus programs: the commercial Norton AntiVirus 
application and the free Avira AntiVir Personal application.
171

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
172
NNote Common sense is one of your best weapons against malicious viruses and software. If something 
sounds too good to be true (“Click here to get your $1,000 check in the mail!”), or even if it sounds remotely 
possible (“Your bank account may be in danger; click here to log in with your password and verify your 
account balance”), don’t do it. Always look at the Internet with a large dose of skepticism. You’ll not only 
increase your odds of avoiding viruses, but you’ll also likely avoid the scam artists out there just waiting to 
pounce.
The Defender
One of the most popular antivirus applications sold today is Norton AntiVirus (NAV). The cur-
rent version is NAV 2009. When installed, the application tells you how many days are left on 
your update subscription (access to downloadable virus updates) and provides some visual 
feedback on the application’s impact on your computer’s processor (CPU) usage. You also 
have the ability to run scans of your computer by clicking the Scan Now link. Figure 9-1 shows 
a virus scan in action.
Figure 9-1. A Norton AntiVirus scan in progress.

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
173
WHAT IS A VIRUS SCAN?
A virus scan is simply the terminology used for when your computer’s antivirus application is examining the 
files stored on your computer for infection by a virus. Most applications give you the ability to scan every file 
on your computer or select specific files or folders. 
It is recommended that you always scan any files that you download from the Internet. Make a habit of 
saving these files into a temporary folder on your hard drive (such as a folder labeled Scan for Viruses), and 
then run your antivirus application and specify that folder be scanned.
You should also make a habit of scanning your entire computer’s hard drive—every single file—weekly 
or at least monthly. Fortunately, most antivirus applications provide scheduling capabilities, so you can con-
figure the application to perform this type of scan late in the evening (3 a.m. is when my scan is performed 
weekly) or on a weekend. Just be sure to leave your computer turned on when the scan is scheduled to 
occur. If you’re not comfortable leaving your computer turned on 24/7 (some users prefer to save electricity 
and others believe that a running computer invites hackers, and both are legitimate concerns), then at least 
leave it on when the antivirus app is scheduled to run. 
NAV’s standard user interface gives you access to other features, such as scheduling and 
creating alerts. And as you run scans of your computer, NAV gives you a real-time update of 
any viruses caught, as well as details on whether the virus could be “cleaned” or if the infected 
file had to be quarantined, which means that it was moved to a safe folder on the hard drive 
where it can’t do any additional damage. (A complete list of the features in the latest version 
of NAV can be found at dppl6++sss*oui]jpa_*_ki+jknpkj+]jperenqo.)
I have a lot of problems with NAV and similar pay-to-use applications. The technology 
used to scan viruses is not only widely available, but it also doesn’t change that often. There 
are hundreds of antivirus applications out there competing for your business and money. But 
there are also dozens of free alternatives that do just as good a job (maybe even better—keep 
reading) as the store-bought versions.
Another complaint I have is that users must pay a yearly (sometimes monthly) subscrip-
tion fee to keep NAV updated with the latest virus database. In my opinion, once you’ve 
purchased the software, you should get the updates for free for as long as you choose to use 
that application. But NAV and other antivirus apps hit you up for $30 or more every year. By 
charging this subscription fee, the antivirus companies are basically forcing you to upgrade 
your software every year. Even Microsoft doesn’t release a new version of Office every year! 
The Contender
Antivirus applications are good only if they actually catch viruses. Antivirus programs use an 
internal database of existing viruses to scan your computer and its files, looking for match-
ing viruses. But new viruses are being created every day! All antivirus programs allow you to 
update this virus database periodically—some monthly, some weekly, and some even daily. 
The important part is that your antivirus program needs to be updated constantly with infor-
mation on the latest virus threats.

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
174
NNote Don’t be confused by those Internet pop-up ads saying “Your computer may be infected! Click 
here . . . .” They’re just trying to sell you something. If you have a legitimate antivirus application running, 
let it tell you if it detects a file infection. 
One of my favorite web sites is dppl6++sss*]r)_kil]n]perao*knc+. I suggest that you 
bookmark it and remember it for future reference. Point your web browser there and click the 
Comparatives tab. You’ll be shown a list of comparison tests this organization performs on 
a variety of antivirus applications. The most recent test will be listed at the bottom, and the 
results can be viewed online by clicking the Online results link, as shown in Figure 9-2. The 
most popular antivirus applications are tested and evaluated, side-by-side, on this web site. 
The number one position changes now and then, but again, this is tried-and-true technology 
that doesn’t really change from application to application.
Figure 9-2. AV-Comparatives offers comparison tests of various antivirus applications.
As this chapter was being written, the current test (performed in November 2008 on 16 
different antivirus applications) pitted the antivirus applications against one million differ-
ent viruses. Can you guess which company got the overall best results? Avira, a company that 

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
175
provides a 100% free version of its antivirus application for you to download and install. (This 
ranking may have changed by the time you read this, but rest assured that Avira is likely to be 
near the top of the list as one of the best antivirus applications.)
Avira AntiVir Personal (AAP) is a free antivirus application for your home computer. 
Avira specifies that it be used for personal use, not business/commercial use. If you’re a small 
business owner and want to play by the rules, Avira encourages you to purchase its Premium 
version. But I recommend that you download and install the free version first, to check how 
it works. If you like it, then by all means consider purchasing the Premium version to support 
the company and encourage it to continue the free Personal version.
Avira has a fairly simple interface, as shown in Figure 9-3, without a lot of bells and whis-
tles. But it does what it’s intended to do—find and remove viruses—and requires no purchase 
on your part.
Figure 9-3. Avira AntiVir Personal is a powerful antivirus application for your PC.
A lot of free antivirus applications are available, but I recommend Avira because I use it, 
and I know it works. The fact that it always scores high in the antivirus comparison tests fur-
ther proves its value and effectiveness. In the remaining sections of this chapter, I’ll show you 
where to get AAP, how to install it, and how to use it. I encourage you to follow along and get 
an antivirus application installed immediately, if you don’t already have one.

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
176
Where to Get the Software
You can download and install the free version of Avira by following these steps:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*bnaa)]r*_ki (or visit dppl6++sss*]ren]*_ki, click the Downloads link, 
and then click Avira AntiVir Personal – Free Antivirus).
 
2. Click the Download Your Free AntiVir button.
 
3. Avira will provide you with two or more locations to download the installation files. 
Pick one and click it. Then follow the instructions to download the Avira installation 
application.
NNote Why would Avira give away a free version of its software? Many companies give away a personal 
(or home) version in the hopes that you’ll like the software and possibly recommend it to your employer or 
buy an upgraded version with more features. The free version of Avira also pops up the occasional sales 
screen that talks about its other products. Just close the window if you’re not interested. Yes, this is a little 
annoying, but keep in mind that you’re getting a top-notch antivirus application for free. You can always 
uninstall it if the pop-ups drive you crazy.
Notes on AAP Installation

Basic AAP Tasks
This section covers two important tasks that you should perform as soon as possible with AAP. 
Open the application by double-clicking the Avira desktop shortcut or the small A icon in your 
system tray, and follow along. 
Run a Complete System Scan
The first time you run AAP, you should perform a scan of your entire hard drive. Don’t be sur-
prised if it finds a few viruses in your files. As you’ll soon see, it found some on my hard drive.
NNote A complete system scan could take some time, so take a break after you start it. Remember that 
there are thousands—possibly tens of thousands—of files on your computer that AAP must examine. 
Here are the steps to follow to perform the complete system scan:
 
1. Open AAP and click the “Scan system now” link, as shown in Figure 9-10. AAP will 
begin to scan your system files, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
2. If AAP finds an infected file, the scan will pause, as shown in Figure 9-12. The default 
choice is to “Move to quarantine,” or you can select the Delete option if you definitely 
don’t want that file on your computer. Also, you can place a check in the box labeled 
“Apply selection to all following detections,” and any future infected files will get the 
same treatment.
NNote What is quarantine? It’s a special folder created on your hard drive where AAP can move files that 
are infected, rather than deleting them. This way, you can examine the files to possibly determine if the 
infection is legitimate or not. Sometimes files are flagged as infected when they’re not; this is called a false-
positive. Some users will scan potentially infected files using another antivirus application as a sort of second 
opinion. Quarantine is sometimes also useful for identifying a file and its creator. You can then notify this 
person that her computer may have a virus infection that is infecting files she is sending out to others.

3. After an infected file is handled, the application begins its scan again. You can click 
the Stop or Pause button at any time, but it’s best to let the scan complete. In my case, 
when AAP finally finished, the complete scan took about one hour and 21 minutes and 
involved more than half a million files! Four infections were found, as shown in Fig-
ure 9-13. I quarantined two of them and deleted the other two.

infections found and time taken.

Schedule Routine Scans
It’s a good idea to have AAP scan your computer without your intervention, possibly weekly or 
monthly. Here’s how to schedule scans to occur on a regular basis:
 
1. Open AAP and click the Administration tab, as shown in Figure 9-15.

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
184
Figure 9-15. Use the Administration tab to configure a scheduled scan.
 
2. Click the Scheduler subtab, as shown in Figure 9-16. If you examine Figure 9-16, you 
can see that a daily update activity is currently scheduled—it has a check mark under 
the Activated column. This means that AAP will attempt to connect and download any 
updates from the company every day.

CHAPTER 9 N  VIRUS PROTECTION
185
Figure 9-16. The Scheduler tab shows the activities that have been scheduled.
 
3. To schedule scans, click the Insert New Job button, as indicated in Figure 9-17.
Figure 9-17. Click the Insert New Job button to create a new job that automates virus 
scanning.
 
4. A window will appear, asking you to provide information about the new job. In Fig-

scan will cover (my ?6 drive). Click the Next button to continue.

I’m creating a weekly scan, I chose Scan job, as shown in Figure 9-19. Click the Next 
button.
Figure 9-19. Select the type of job you wish to schedule: scan or update.

6. In the next window, select which files you wish to scan from the drop-down menu. You 
can choose My Documents, system files, hard drives, and so on. Individual files can be 
selected by choosing the Manual option in the drop-down menu. I selected Local Hard 
Disks, as shown in Figure 9-20 Click the Next button to proceed.
Figure 9-20. Select the files, folders, or hard drives you wish to scan.
 
7. In the next window, select the frequency of the scan. For this job, I selected Weekly. 
Additional options are available after you choose the schedule. For my job, I selected 
Sunday at 3 a.m. for my weekly scan, as shown in Figure 9-21. Click the Next button to 
continue.
 
8. Choose whether AAP runs in the background (invisible), minimized (visible as a tab on 
the taskbar), or maximized (visible on the screen) from the pull-down menu, as shown 
in Figure 9-22. You can also choose whether to have AAP shut down your computer 
when the scan is done by placing a check in the box labeled “Shut down computer if 
job is done.” Click the Finish button after you’ve made your selections. The Scheduler 
now lists your new job in the window, as shown in Figure 9-23.
Now that I’ve scheduled the weekly scan, if I leave my computer on Sunday evening, the 
scanning will start at 3 a.m.—perfect! It’s just like any chore: leave the trash can on the curb 
on Thursday morning, mow the grass on Saturday, and so on. But this one doesn’t require any 
manual labor!

Investigate Further
Besides viruses, you also need to protect your computer from something called spyware (or 
malware). Spyware is typically installed on your computer without your knowledge when 
you install certain programs or visit specific web sites. As the name implies, the software is 
designed to spy on your activities—shopping habits, books purchased, clothing ordered, and 
so on—and report back to the company that created the software. This information is typically 
used to flood your e-mail inbox (or your real mailbox) with spam and junk mail. At other times, 
the spyware is installed for malicious reasons, such as to collect your credit card number when 
you order something online or store passwords you use when logging in to certain web sites.
Spyware is a major hassle, but fortunately, two of the best anti-spyware applications are 
100% free:
s ,AVASOFTS !D!WARE dppl6++sss*h]r]okbp*_ki 
s 3PYBOTn3EARCH  $ESTROY dppl6++sss*olu^kp*ejbk 
Pick one and install it (many people install both). Both applications are designed to 
update regularly and block known spyware from being installed on your computer. They run 
in the background, invisible to you, and alert you when something unfriendly tries to install 
itself. (I’ve used both and am currently running Spybot on my own computers.)
Summary
If you’re a homeowner, you most likely take regular precautions such as checking the batter-
ies on your smoke detectors and testing the alarm system to protect your investment. With a 
vehicle, you change the oil regularly and rotate your tires. So why should your computer be 
treated any differently? 
For your PC, you shouldn’t be concerned about just the hardware. Your software, personal 
and business files, and operating system should all be protected from harm, and an antivirus 
application is the place to start. Even if you intend to use your computer only for browsing the 
Internet and exchanging e-mail, installing an antivirus application is the most important task 
you’ll perform if you wish to have a happy, healthy computer.
AAP is free and easy to use. There’s simply no excuse not to protect the valuables stored 
on your computer’s hard drive. Set aside some time soon to download and install this great 
little application. Also be sure to read the next chapter, which covers another critical way to 
protect your computer: backing up your data.

Data Backup
This is a true story. In 2002, I was working as a jack-of-all-trades computer guy for a small 
company. I fixed computers, debugged laptops, installed software, managed e-mail and web 
site servers for various companies, and everything in between. On one particular blue-sky, 
birds-are-singing day, my phone rang. A “high-level” employee (let’s call him Tony) for one of 
the small businesses I supported was in near panic because some files on his computer had 
disappeared. He had been working all week on them, and when he left the office the previous 
night, the files were still there. The next morning, they were gone.
He looked in the Recycle Bin, but the files weren’t there. He did a file search of his entire 
hard drive using a few of the file names, but the files didn’t turn up. Tony was ready to flip out! 
I calmed him down, rearranged some scheduled appointments, got in my car, and paid a visit.
My initial search found nothing. (I had some special debugging software that would let me 
examine deleted files that weren’t showing up in the Recycle Bin, but it was no use.) The files 
weren’t there. But I still had one option left.
I accessed the company’s file server (its shared office computer), and located a folder I 
had created months earlier labeled Pkju >]_gql. As a precaution, I had installed some simple 
backup software on the ten computers in this office. This software automatically backed up 
the Iu @k_qiajpo folder of each PC to the server at 3 a.m. (my favorite backup time). Tony’s 
files were there, and I copied them over to his computer in about 20 seconds. 
Everyone was happy, including the office manager, who promptly paid my bill (including 
the emergency call fee) on the spot.
I have dozens of stories like this one, from friends as well as customers, but not all of them 
end happily. Data losses happen, and as computers get more complex, the possibility of major 
mistakes gets greater, too. It’s not just an event in big offices—it could easily happen to you. 
Fortunately, this story did end on a happy note, and all because I knew the value of performing 
regular backups of my customers’ valuable data. 
Just like a word processor used to write a letter or an antivirus application that scans files 
for viruses, software exists to assist you with backups. In this chapter, you’ll learn about a com-
mercial backup program that you can purchase, and a free software package that will probably 
take care of all your backup needs.
Your Valuable Data
Think about the types of files you have stored on your PC. These days, an increasing amount 
of important personal information is stored only on your PC. There are work documents and 
personal documents. You’ll find everything from your company’s confidential stock report to 
your grandmother’s original recipe for chicken soup, photos of last year’s vacation, video of 
191

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
192
your child’s first steps, scanned receipts for your small business purchases, financial reports, 
resumes, addresses and phone numbers, e-mail, and much more. 
What would you do if you were told those files would be deleted from your computer’s 
hard drive tomorrow? Most likely, you would burn as much of it as possible to a CD or DVD, 
or copy it to another computer. You would do whatever you could to make sure a copy (or 
copies) existed, right?
Well, the bad news is that most of us are never given a warning that our data will be 
deleted. You might turn on your computer one day and discover a file has disappeared. 
Or your three-year-old son, who has carefully observed how you press keys and move the 
mouse, decides to take a spin on your laptop, and manages a dozen right-click-and-delete 
actions, including emptying the Recycle Bin. Maybe you made some significant changes to 
an original document yesterday (without working on a copy) and then realized that you need 
the original back.
Whatever the reason, if you value your data, you need to protect it. This means imple-
menting a plan to back up your data regularly. This plan will involve using an application 
to back up your data to CD or a DVD, or possibly to a second hard drive. It will involve con-
figuring the application to perform the backup, whether or not you’re sitting in front of the 
computer. And it will require that you understand how to restore one or more files should the 
need arise.
BACKING UP YOUR DATA IS ONLY PART OF THE PLAN
In the previous chapter, you read about the importance of installing and using a good antivirus application. 
Not only can an antivirus program protect your operating system, but it can also keep your data files from 
becoming infected or damaged by viruses and other malicious software (or malware). But even if you’re 
running an antivirus application, there’s always a small chance that files can be infected, damaged, or even 
deleted by a virus or malware that sneaks through your defenses. That’s where your data backup plan comes 
into play.
I suggest that you perform three tasks to protect your computer, software, and data files:
s 2UN AN ANTIVIRUS APPLICATION COVERED IN #HAPTER 	
s #REATE A REGULAR DATA BACKUP PLAN—and use it (covered in this chapter). 
s #REATE AN IMAGE OR COPY	 OF YOUR HARD DRIVE that backs up your operating system and applications 
(covered in this book’s appendix). In the event of a hard drive failure, the image can be reinstalled on a 
new hard drive.
Of the three tasks, backing up your data is probably the most important. You can always reinstall your 
operating system and applications should a nasty virus (or other malware) do its worst or a hard drive fail. But 
if your data is damaged or deleted and you don’t have a backup, it’s gone forever.

The Defender
One of the larger software companies out there, Symantec, offers what many consider to be 
the industry-standard backup program: Norton Save & Restore. This program is a useful base-
line for our comparison.
Figure 10-1 shows a backup strategy being created while installing Norton Save & Restore. 
Figure 10-2 shows how you can select specific file type folders to protect via backup.

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
194
As with most Norton products, Save & Restore doesn’t skimp on the features. You are 
given many more options than are necessary—a lot of them clearly intended for professional 
computer guys like me (and not necessarily for you, the end user). This can be good and bad. 
You’re sure to find the method you like best for backing up your data, but it can take a while to 
learn how to properly tune the application to get it to do exactly what you want.
Norton Save & Restore offers some key features that you’ll definitely want to look for in 
a data backup application. These include the ability to automate your backups, as well as to 
select individual files and folders to be backed up. If you need to restore files, Save & Restore 
allows you to pick only those files or folders you wish to retrieve and leave the rest. You also 
have the ability to encrypt your data backups. (I don’t recommend encryption, just in case you 
forget the password, but the option is there.) You also get the ability to back up the Windows 
startup files required to get Windows back to a working condition.
Finally, Save & Restore supports full, incremental, and differential backups. A full backup 
is just what it sounds like: everything is backed up. With an incremental or differential backup, 
only those files that have changed since the last full backup are backed up in subsequent 
backup operations. This can save space on your hard drive or other storage media where you 
store your backup files.
In a nutshell, Norton Save & Restore gives you the ability to create scheduled, automated 
backups (full, incremental, and differential) of your files, folders, and operating system, as 
well as the ability to restore those same files, folders, and system files. But you can already 
guess what I’m going to tell you next, can’t you? Yes, almost all of these same features can be 
obtained absolutely free, and I’m going to show you the application that can do it.
NTip While the ability to back up the Windows system files is a very useful feature, you can get the same 
functionality (for free) by creating a hard drive image. This book’s appendix provides information about a free 
application you can use to do this. 
The Contender
When it comes to data backup software, what you’re really looking for is an application that 
will let you do both manual backups (at the time of your choosing) and automated backups 
(again, at a time of your choosing, but without you needing to start the process), selecting the 
files and folders that you wish to include in the backup. Cobian Backup is a good solution.
Cobian Backup, shown in Figure 10-3, is an open source data backup application with 
numerous special features built in. Rest assured, however, that if your primary goal is to sim-
ply make backups of your data quickly and easily, without a lot of messy settings to learn, 
Cobian Backup is all you need.

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
195
Figure 10-3. Cobian Backup lets you create multiple backup jobs to run at any time.
Cobian Backup can back up both files and folders. This means that Cobian Backup is ide-
ally suited for backing up the contents of an entire folder such as Iu @k_qiajpo or something 
as specific as a single OpenOffice.org spreadsheet named Iu?qnnajpEjraopiajpo*k`o, located 
in the subfolder Iu Bej]j_ao of Iu @k_qiajpo.
Cobian Backup also works great when you need to restore a complete folder or an individ-
ual file. When you find that you need to retrieve a damaged or deleted file, you simply restore 
that file to the original location. If you need to recover an entire folder, without overwriting the 
contents of the original folder (say, your Iu @k_qiajpo folder), you can choose to restore to a 
temporary folder, copy the files you need to the original location, and then delete the tempo-
rary folder.
NNote #OBIAN "ACKUP ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO SCHEDULE YOUR BACKUPS TO RUN AT A LATER TIME 4HIS DOES REQUIRE
that you leave your computer turned on so the backup can occur, but it’s a small price to pay for the ability of 
running a data backup at a more convenient time.
Cobian Backup is a powerful backup tool, but one with a simple-to-use interface that 
helps you set up quick and easy backups. What I like best about it is that I can create a hand-
ful of different backup routines (called tasks) ahead of time, and run them when I need them

with a single click of a button. I store my personal files in dedicated folders with names 
like Iu Lnkfa_po, Iu Iqoe_, and Iu Ldkpko. This way, I know that when I run a backup task 
labeled Iu Iqoe_, all my music files will be included. The backup file is written to a folder that 
I’ve named >]_gql Pdeo Beha. I can burn that file to a CD or DVD at my leisure, and store it 
somewhere other than on my hard drive, or upload it to a data storage site of my choice (like 
]`nera*_ki, which offers free online storage space that doesn’t expire).

Basic Cobian Backup Tasks
The two basic Cobian Backup tasks are as follows:
Back up files and folders: This is the process in which you choose which files and folders 
you wish to copy to a backup.
Restore files and folders: This is the process in which you select files and folders to restore 
to your computer.
The most frequent task that you will perform using Cobian Backup is backing up files and 
folders. Cobian Backup allows you to save your backups in *vel format (a standardized, “com-
pressed” file format that takes up less space). This allows you to quickly and easily examine a 
zipped file to find the files and/or folders you need to recover.
I’ll cover both the backup and restore tasks here, and show you how easy it is to use this 
application. As you read through the following section, I highly encourage you to follow along 
and perform a backup immediately.
Back Up Files and Folders
Without a backup, there can be no recovery. First, you create a backup task that will run auto-
matically at the time you scheduled. Then you can test that task by running it manually.
Create a Backup Task
Use the following process to create a task to back up the important files on your system:
 
1. Double-click the Cobian Backup icon located in the system tray in the lower-right 
corner (as noted, it looks like a half moon). Cobian Backup will open, as shown in 
Figure 10-4.
 
2. Select Task ° New Task to open the Properties window for your new backup task.
 
3. On the General page, enter a name for the backup task, as shown in the example in 
Figure 10-5. Be as descriptive as you can, including dates and folder names if possible. 
(Having eight different backup files named >=?GQL can make life difficult later!) 
 
4. Note the options for full, incremental, and differential backups, just as are available 
with Norton Save & Restore. For right now, select the Full radio button, as this will be 
your first backup. On subsequent backups, you can choose the Differential or Incre-
mental option to save space.

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
199
NNote Differential and Incremental backups allow you to back up files that have changed since the last full 
backup. For example, if you run a weekly full backup every Sunday night, you could choose to create a differ-
ential backup that runs on Wednesday of each week. This backup will consist of a smaller collection of files, 
because only those files that have been modified will be included in the differential backup process. The 
incremental backup process is useful if you want to run daily backups between two full backups and include 
only those files that have changed. For a more detailed discussion of the differences between differential and 
incremental backups, visit dppl6++aj*segela`e]*knc+sege+>]_gql[nkp]pekj[o_daia.
 
5. Click Files in the list along the left side of the window to move to the Files page. 
 
6. Click the Add button under the Source section and select Files, as shown in Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-6. Select the sources (files and directories) to be added to the backup.
 
7. Browse to the locations of the files you wish to back up, select the files, and click the 
Open button. You can Ctrl-click to select multiple files at once. To back up complete 
folders (directories), click the Add button, select Directory, browse to the folder you 
wish to add to your backup, and click the OK button.

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
200
NTip Notice the “Drag’n’drop from Explorer” link at the top of the Properties page. You can simply click this 
link, and then drag a folder from Windows Explorer to the Source box here to add it to the list of files to be 
backed up.
 
8. Click the Add button under the Destination section and select Directory, as shown in 
Figure 10-7. 
Figure 10-7. Select the destination folder where the backup file will be stored.
 
9. Specify a folder where the backup will be stored. For my example, I have created a 
folder on my Desktop called >]_gql Pdeo Beha, where my backup will be stored. 
 
10. Click Schedule in the list along the left side of the page to move to the Schedule page. 
 
11. From the Schedule type drop-down menu, you can choose how frequently you would 
like this backup to run: Once, Daily, Weekly, and other options are available. In the 
example shown in Figure 10-8, I’ve selected to run a weekly backup on Tuesdays at 3 
a.m. Other options will allow you to specify the day of the month, or even a specific day 
of the year.

NTip Why might you want to run a manual backup instead of waiting for the scheduled backup? You might 
choose to run a manual backup any time you are preparing to install new software or maybe to add new 
HARDWARE AND THE SOFTWARE REQUIRED FOR THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE IT	 2UNNING A MANUAL BACKUP
simply gives you peace of mind—you’ll know that any major problems encountered during the installation 
of software or hardware won’t affect your existing data. Another suggestion is to run a manual backup if 
you’ve recently added or modified a substantial number of files. Adding a few hundred photos from a friend’s 
memory card or, in my case, completing two or three chapters in a few short days may warrant an immedi-
ate backup to ensure those new files are protected. 
Figure 10-11. Run your backup task manually to create a backup now.
When the backup task has completed, you can view the log to verify that it ran and files 
were backed up, as shown in Figure 10-12. Notice in Figure 10-12 that the last line states:
>]_gql bkn @=O@ kj Jkrai^an 0 aj`a`*
That’s good news!
Figure 10-12. When the backup process completes, the log will let you know.

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
204
You can verify that the backup worked by opening the destination folder you chose. In my 
case, that’s the >]_gql Pdeo Beha folder on my Desktop, as shown in Figure 10-13.
Figure 10-13. Double-click the zipped backup to verify the files inside are the correct ones.
Your backup is done! Now all that’s left is to burn this folder to a CD or DVD, copy it to 
a USB flash drive, or upload it to an online storage service. After backing up the file, you can 
delete it from your destination folder (the >]_gql Pdeo Beha folder in my case) and wait for the 
next scheduled backup to run. 
Restore Files and Folders
Let’s assume for the moment that you’ve turned on your computer and found that the files 
and folder you backed up earlier have been deleted and are not recoverable. What you do 
have, however, is a small USB flash drive containing your zipped backup file. Recovery doesn’t 
get any easier than inserting your flash drive into your computer and performing the following 
steps:
 
1. Open the *vel file by double-clicking it.
 
2. Locate and select a file that you need to restore.
 
3. Right-click the file and select Copy (or press Ctrl+C).
 
4. On your computer, browse to the location where you wish to place your recovered file, 
right-click, and select Paste (or press Ctrl+V).
You will find that your file is back. (The preceding steps work for recovering a folder, too.)

your backup file on your computer’s hard drive is a common mistake. Although it may be faster and 
easier, it’s like placing all your eggs in one basket. If your hard drive dies (or your computer is stolen), 
you lose your original data and your backup. It’s best to be safe and store the backup separately from the 
original data.
You might have expected that recovery would be tricky and complex, but in fact, having a 
zipped file that contains your data backup provides a lot of flexibility. You can place files and 
folders wherever you wish, including the original location or a completely different one. You 
can store the zipped file on all different types of media—CD, DVD, flash drive, and external 
hard drive are great options. You can also store your most important working files online, then 
download them onto any computer you need to work from to re-create your working environ-
ment on a new computer in an instant. And finally, you can take the zipped file with you and 
open it on another computer if you wish. 
Investigate Further
I didn’t cover backing up your e-mail and address book in this chapter. That’s because there 
are many different e-mail applications out there, and each one has a slightly different method 
for backing up those files that contain your e-mail messages and address book. Yes, your 
e-mail messages and address book are stored as files on your computer. This means that you 
can back them up, too. You don’t need to buy a program that advertises specifically “Backs up 
your e-mail and address book!” It’s incredibly simple just to back up those items yourself with 
Cobian Backup, for free.
The following are some web links that provide step-by-step instructions for locating and 
backing up those files that contain your e-mail and address book for the most popular e-mail 
applications:
s -ICROSOFT /UTLOOK: dppl6++kbbe_a*ie_nkokbp*_ki+aj)qo+kqphkkg+D=,-,431/.-,//*]olt
s -ICROSOFT /UTLOOK %XPRESS: dppl6++oqllknp*ie_nkokbp*_ki+g^+.3,23,

s 4HUNDERBIRD: dppl6++g^*ikvehh]veja*knc+=n_derejc[ukqn[a)i]eh
If your e-mail program isn’t on this list, a simple Google search using the keywords 
“backup e-mail” and your e-mail program name should provide instructions. 
The key point to understand is that once you locate the folder or folders that contain your 
e-mail and address book, you can add those folders and files to your backup routine. Just make 
sure to close your e-mail application before backing up the files—that’s the safest way to make 
certain you get a good backup.

CHAPTER 10 N  DATA BACKUP
206
Summary
Only you know the value of your data. The cost to pull data off of a failed hard drive typically 
runs between $1,000 and $5,000, and there’s no guarantee that a data-recovery company will 
be able to retrieve it all. Even if you think your data has no monetary value, consider the time 
it might take to reproduce it. If you’ve spent hours (or days) writing a document or creating a 
detailed spreadsheet, remember the old adage “Time is money.” The effort you would need to 
put into re-creating lost data will take time, and that’s going to cost you (or your business or 
family) time that is better spent doing something else.
Come up with a data backup strategy, and implement it! Do it once a week or once a 
month, but set aside some time to create an automated data-recovery process that will run 
when you’re away from your computer. The few minutes you spend setting up a data-recovery 
plan may very well save you hours—maybe even days—of work, as well as eliminate the stress 
you will encounter if you should suddenly find your data is gone. The software won’t cost you 
a penny.

Personal Finance
One of the first things a financial advisor typically will tell a new client is, “If you wish to 
improve your financial situation, you must know your current financial status.” This means 
knowing how much money you have coming in (your paycheck, for example) and how much 
money is going out (such as your bills). My financial advisor, Blair, told my wife and me that 
we were going to be shocked the first time we saw a pie chart showing the breakdown of where 
our money was being spent. Dining out, a weekly movie rental or two, that daily coffee shop 
visit—they all add up.
One of the very first instructions I received from my financial advisor was to install a 
money management application on my computer. Blair told me that the software would allow 
us to see where our money was going and help us to develop a budget to keep our spending 
under control. He also said that the software would help us manage our funds so we could 
increase our investments, pay down debt faster, and build up that mythical six-months-of-
expenses safety fund that we’re supposed to have.
All of that sounded great, but then Blair told me to do something that surprised me: buy 
a $60 piece of software. You would think that the financial industry would have some sort of 
free application that customers could download and install, right? But it appears that the advi-
sors have fallen into the same trap as most computer users, and go with the big-name software 
because that’s what everyone uses, or maybe they just don’t realize there are other options 
when it comes to financial software.
The story doesn’t end there, though. After purchasing the software (I’ll tell you its name 
shortly) and installing it, I found that it was not that intuitive to use. Not only did I need to 
buy a book to learn how to use it ($20 extra), but I also needed to call my bank and sign up for 
a service ($4 per month) that would allow this software to communicate with my bank and 
update my financial information. Yes, it’s nice that the software talks to my bank each week 
and downloads my latest transactions, but if I could save $48 per year and download the trans-
actions in a spreadsheet format myself, I sure would prefer that method.
After about three months of using the big-name software, I began my search for a free 
financial management application, and—wouldn’t you know it—I found a great one. It’s open 
source, free (with no strings attached), and so easy to use I couldn’t believe it. I download my 
transactions from my bank in a standard format, and then this financial application imports 
the file in less than 30 seconds, so that saves $48.
In this chapter, I’ll introduce you to two applications for your financial management 
needs. Intuit’s Quicken is considered the industry standard. Money Manager Ex is quickly 
becoming a word-of-mouth, open source success story.
207

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE

The Defender
The biggest name in personal finance management software is Intuit’s Quicken. If you’ve 
never heard of it, you’re in an extreme minority. Intuit advertises its flagship product on TV 
and radio, and in every newspaper and magazine imaginable. Quicken’s primary purpose is 
to gather your financial data and organize it in an easy-to-follow and easy-to-search man-
ner. Versions of Quicken can be found for personal use and business use, as well as to track 
investments.
Quicken’s user interface, shown in Figure 11-1, seems to change year to year, but the basic 
idea is the same: your data is broken into the three areas of Money In, Money Out, and What’s 
Left. You can configure Quicken to communicate with your bank and grab transactions such 
as deposits (Money In) and bills paid (Money Out). You can also configure the frequency with 
which Quicken logs in to your bank and grabs this information. The What’s Left section per-
forms the calculations and shows you the balance of funds you have remaining.
Figure 11-1. Intuit’s Quicken is the most popular personal finance management application.
Quicken keeps the details hidden until you decide to view them. Features allow you to 
burrow deeper, looking at individual transactions. Quicken also organizes your transactions 
using predefined labels such as Mortgage and Fuel, but you can create custom labels, such as 
Babysitter and Bookstore. When you assign a transaction a label, you are able to use Quicken 
to filter your transactions. This allows you, for example, to see how much money you spend 
per month on books and how much filling up your car’s tank is costing you per year. (A com-
plete list of the features found in the latest versions of Intuit’s Quicken can be found at dppl6++
mqe_gaj*ejpqep*_ki.)

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
209
NNote Although Quicken updates every year (I own Quicken 2007), you’re not required to upgrade to the 
latest version. Older versions of Quicken will continue to work, but Intuit is always changing the user inter-
face and adding new features. Some users are unaware of this and purchase the latest version year after 
year, thinking that they must have the current year’s release.
However, Quicken can be a little overwhelming. A lot of features are built into this appli-
cation, and many of them require customization to use. For instance, my financial planner 
wanted me to e-mail him reports in certain formats, and it took me some time and experimen-
tation to get it right. As I mentioned, I ended up purchasing a book just so I could learn how to 
use Quicken. Ultimately, I got frustrated with the application, and I’ve turned down pop-up 
offers to upgrade the product. 
But that’s my experience. Quicken definitely has a large base of users who are fond of the 
application, which is why it continues to be the sales leader for this type of software. If you are 
currently using Quicken and are happy with it, then by all means, continue using it. But you 
might want to keep reading and learn about a free alternative that may just provide everything 
you need in a personal finance application. You might find, as I did, that you can take that $60 
(or more) per year you saved by not purchasing financial software and put it back into your 
bank account.
The Contender
I enjoy introducing people to Money Manager Ex. This free, open source personal finance 
application is truly one of those little-known software gems, and it’s definitely beginning to get 
the attention it deserves.
Like almost all open source applications, Money Manager Ex comes with online support, 
including a discussion forum where users can post questions and learn more about using 
this software. It’s free to download, it has no advertisements, and you are most certainly not 
required to upgrade it every year. 
Figure 11-2 shows the Money Manager Ex interface. The left window pane lets you select 
from multiple options that display specific types of financial data: bank account, stocks, assets, 
and a variety of reports. After you select an option on the left, the desired information is dis-
played in the larger viewing area on the right. Menu options allow you to switch back and forth 
between multiple types of accounts, print reports, and back up your financial data to files that 
can be stored on your hard drive or burned to a CD or DVD.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE

Figure 11-2. Money Manager Ex has an easy-to-read user interface.
Don’t let Money Manager Ex’s simple user interface fool you, though. It has some power-
ful features that I’ll demonstrate after explaining how to install and download the software.
Where to Get the Software
To install Money Manager Ex, you first need to download the software for your operating 
system. Versions exist for Windows, Mac, and Linux. To find the correct version for your com-
puter, follow these steps:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*_k`ah]pda*_ki+iiat+.

Notes on Money Manager Ex Installation
To install the software, double-click the Money Manager Ex installation icon. Follow the on-
screen instructions, including accepting the license agreement and selecting whether Money 
Manager Ex places a shortcut icon on your desktop and/or a Quick Launch icon. 
To run Money Manager Ex, double-click the desktop shortcut icon, or start the application 
from the Start menu. The first time you run the application, you’ll be asked to select your lan-
guage from a list. Select your language and click the OK button. The next dialog box prompts 
you to create or open a database, as shown in Figure 11-3. After you create your first database 
(as described in the next section), this dialog box will not appear again unless you place a 
check in the box labeled “Show this window next time Money Manager Ex – CodeLathe starts.”
Figure 11-3. Money Manager Ex will prompt you to create a new database.
Basic Money Manager Ex Tasks
Before you start using Money Manager Ex, you must create a database where your financial 
data will be stored. Here, I’ll show you how to create a database, import financial transactions, 
and examine your personal finances.
Create a Database
All of your financial data will be stored in a single database file stored on your computer. To 
create this database, follow these steps:

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
212
 
1. Start Money Manager Ex by double-clicking the desktop shortcut icon or from the Start 
menu. Select your language and click the OK button. In the next dialog box, click the 
Create a New Database button, as shown in Figure 11-4.
Figure 11-4. Create a new database to hold your financial data.
 
2. The “Choose database file to create” window opens. Here, you pick the location to 
store the database file and give the file a name. Give your database file a memorable 
name, and put it somewhere you can remember, such as in a special folder in your 
Iu @k_qiajpo folder or on your desktop. In the example in Figure 11-5, I’m creating a 
folder in Iu @k_qiajpo called IIAT and naming my database file >NS (for Blue Rocket 
Writing, my company). Click Save to continue.
Figure 11-5. Pick a location for your database file and give it a name.
 
3. The New Database Wizard starts, as shown in Figure 11-6. Click the Next button to 
continue.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
213
Figure 11-6. The New Database Wizard will walk you through setting up your database 
file.
 
4. Click the Set Currency button and select the type of currency used in your financial 
data. In Figure 11-7, I’ve selected US Dollar. Enter a username, and then click the 
Finish button.
Figure 11-7. Provide a currency type and username for your database file.
 
5. Next, you need to create an account using the Add Account Wizard, as shown in 
Figure 11-8. Click the Next button.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
214
Figure 11-8. You must create an account that will be used to access the financial data.
 
6. Provide a name for the account. In the example in Figure 11-9, I’ve given my account 
the name >NS[^]jg. Click the Next button.
Figure 11-9. Provide a name for the account that you will easily recognize.
 
7. In the next window, select the type of account from the drop-down menu. Your choices 
are Checking/Savings or Investments. In Figure 11-10, I’ve selected Checking/Savings. 
Click the Finish button.
 
8. Finally, you can provide helpful details about your account. In the example shown 
in Figure 11-11, I’ve entered some information about my account, including the web 
address and contact name. (I’ve obscured my bank account number for obvious rea-
sons.) Click the OK button when you’re finished.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
215

NTip You can create multiple databases to use with Money Manager Ex. This is useful if you’re married and 
have separate bank accounts, for example. 

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
216
Figure 11-12 shows the starting window for Money Manager Ex after you’ve created your 
database file. As you can see, your username is shown (FBG in this example), and the account 
name and balance are displayed (>NS[^]jg in this example). It’s not much to look at yet—it’s 
blank, in fact—because you haven’t imported any financial transactions. I’ll show you how to 
do that next.
Figure 11-12. Your account is created and is now ready for financial transactions.
Import Financial Transactions
Money Manager Ex isn’t going to be of much use to you without actual financial data. Figure 
11-12 shows a basic Money Manager Ex database, ready to be loaded up with transactions. 
How the application does this involves importing what’s known as a comma-separated value 
(CSV) file. A CSV file stores data using commas to separate each piece of information. CSV 
files can be opened and viewed using a spreadsheet application or even a basic text editor like 
Notepad. 
The following is an example of a portion of the text from the CSV file I’ve downloaded. (I’ll 
show you how this is done shortly.)

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE

--+-,+.,,4( @A>EP( ( =IANE?=J ATLNAOO AHA? NAIEP( )tt*tt
--+/+.,,4( @A>EP( ---2( ---2( )tt*tt
If this file is viewed in a spreadsheet, the first line provides the column names, including 
the order that the data will be provided. The date of a transaction is listed first, followed by a 
comma, then the type of transaction (credit or debit), another comma, and so on. This is the 
format that Money Manager Ex will import using a CSV file that you specify.
Download and Prepare Your Financial Data
Most banks offer customers the ability to download their financial data in CSV format. The 
only difference is in how a bank customer obtains the file. If you do any type of online banking, 
look for a link with a label such as “Download transactions” or “Download your account info.” 
If you’re unable to find a way to download a CSV file, you’ll need to contact a bank representa-
tive and inquire how to download your account information. 
NNote If you haven’t signed up for online access to your bank account, you should do so! Many banks offer 
preferential treatment—such as reduced fees, free transactions, or reduced monthly fees—for signing up for 
online access. Most banks do not charge for online banking services. However, there are always exceptions. 
It is possible that your bank may charge you a fee of some sort to access your account information online. 
It’s up to you to decide if that’s worth the price. My suggestion is to change banks if you’re being charged for 
this type of service.
To show you how to download your financial data and prepare the CVS file, I’ll walk you 
through how I do it. Your steps will be similar.
 
1. I log into my bank account using my bank’s online access.
 
2. Along the left side of my bank’s access screen is a link labeled Download transactions, 
as shown in Figure 11-13, which I click. Your bank may put the access options in a dif-
ferent location or format, but an option to download transactions should be there. 
NCaution Be certain you’re logging in to your bank’s official web site and not a fake web site created by 
phishers. Read more about phishing at dppl6++aj*segela`e]*knc+sege+Ldeodejc. 

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
218
Figure 11-13. Use the appropriate link from your bank’s online banking web site to 
download transactions.
 
3. I’m presented with a window like the one shown in Figure 11-14. I enter dates in the 
From and To fields to indicate the financial data I want. In this example, I’ve selected 
November 1, 2008, through December 8, 2008. I’ve also selected CSV from the Software 
drop-down menu as the format for the data. (Other options offered by my bank are 
Microsoft Money, Quicken, and QuickBooks formats.) Then I click the Next button.
Figure 11-14. I’ve selected dates and the CSV format for my financial transactions.
 
4. On the next screen, I click the Download button, and the file is downloaded to my 
desktop, shown in Figure 11-15. (My default spreadsheet application is OpenOffice.org 
Calc, so the icon looks like an OpenOffice.org Calc sheet; see Chapter 4 for more infor-
mation about Calc.)
Figure 11-15. A CSV file appears on my desktop.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
219
 
5. I open the downloaded CSV file. You can open this file using a spreadsheet or text edi-
tor application such as Notepad. Figure 11-16 shows how the data appears (with some 
of my personal data censored) in a spreadsheet (top) and a plain text editor (bottom). 
Figure 11-16. A CSV file can appear differently, depending on the application you use to open it.
 
6. Money Manager Ex doesn’t care about any data (including column names) other than 
the transaction information. This means I need to edit this CSV file and delete that 
extra information at the top showing headings like Account Number and Account 
Type, as well as the column names like Date Posted and Transaction Type. I don’t need 
the headings, because I’ll tell Money Manager Ex what each comma-delimited field 
means when I import the data. I note the order of the headings, as this is also impor-
tant when I import the data. In Figure 11-17, you can see that I’ve deleted the extra 
information (compare it to Figure 11-16).
 
7. I save the edited file. Now I’m ready to import it into Money Manager Ex.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
220
Figure 11-17. You may need to edit the CSV file to remove unwanted data.
Import the CVS File
After you’ve prepared the CVS file containing your financial data, you need to import this file 
into Money Manager Ex, as follows:
 
1. Select File ° Import ° Universal CSV Files, as shown in Figure 11-18. 
Figure 11-18. Choose to import the CSV file into Money Manager Ex.
 
2. The Universal CSV Importer Dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-19. In this 
dialog box, you define what each field in your CSV data file means. This is how you tell 
Money Manager Ex that the text “11/24/2008” is a date, or that the number 1116 is a 
check number. Money Manager Ex also must be told the order of the transaction data. 
Click the Add button to see the fields available.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
221
Figure 11-19. Each type of CSV data will need to be defined.
 
3. The CSV dialog box lists the fields in your file, as shown in Figure 11-20. In some 
instances, the names may not match exactly. For example, the headings from my CSV 
file use Description instead of Payee, and Check No. instead of Transaction Number. 
Select a field and click OK to add it into the Universal CSV Importer Dialog box list. 
 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add the fields from your CSV file. Order the fields in this list by 
using the Move Up and Move Down buttons. I added the five fields you see in Figure 
11-21. I used the Move Up and Move Down buttons to reorder the fields to match the 
headings from my CSV file. As you can see, I’ve selected the order as Date, Category, 
Transaction Number, Payee, and Amount (+/–) to match my CSV data fields of Date 
Posted, Transaction Type, Check No., Description, and Transaction Amount.
Figure 11-20. Select the field names for your CSV data.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
222
Figure 11-21. Reorder the field names to match the order of your CSV data.
 
5. When you’re finished adding and arranging fields, click the Save As Template button. 
This saves the information to a file, so you don’t need to re-create this CSV structure.
 
6. Click the Import File button. You’ll be asked which account the data will be imported 
into, as shown in Figure 11-22. Select an account, and then click the OK button.
Figure 11-22. Pick the account where the imported data will be added.
 
7. In the next window, browse to the location of your edited CSV file. Select the file and 
click the Open button.
 
8. The data will be imported, and a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 11-23 
will appear. Click the OK button.
 
9. In the Money Manager Ex main window, click your account name in the left column, 
and you’ll see the newly imported transactions, as shown in Figure 11-24.

Now that the data has been imported, you can use the features of Money Manager Ex.
Examine Your Personal Finances
It’s time to let Money Manager Ex help you understand your financial situation. The appli-
cation does this by using a set of reports, which are accessible from the left side of the main 
window, as shown in Figure 11-25.

CHAPTER 11 N  PERSONAL FINANCE
224
Figure 11-25. Reports provide assistance in interpreting your finances.
Suppose you want to see a breakdown of where your money is being spent. To do this, 
click the report labeled Where the Money Goes. You’ll see a pie chart and list, as shown in 
Figure 11-26.
If you want more details, such as exactly who or what business is getting your money, click 
the To Whom the Money Goes report. You’ll see another pie chart plus the descriptions of your 
payees, as shown in Figure 11-27. 
There are many more reports available, and I encourage you to play around with all of 
them. Don’t worry about making mistakes. Money Manager Ex doesn’t have direct access to 
your funds, so you won’t suddenly find your bank account empty.

Investigate Further
If you like the simplicity of Money Manager Ex, you’ll definitely want to spend some time 
learning more about its features. Use the built-in manual by clicking the Help menu. Con-
sider learning how to use Money Manager Ex to create a budget. You might also want to 
investigate setting up repeating transactions (such as a monthly gym membership), as well 
as adding in the ability to track your stock portfolio. Remember that Money Manager Ex has 
a growing community of users who often post questions on the official forum at dppl6++sss*
_k`ah]pda*_ki+bknqi.
While I prefer to keep my financial data on my own computer, if you’re looking for soft-
ware that fits the SaaS category, you might want to check out Buxfer, an online personal 
finance application. A lot of people recommend it, and the application definitely looks user-
friendly. You can find it at dppl6++sss*^qtban*_ki.
Summary
Why pay for software to help you with your personal finances? If you’re trying to get con-
trol of your spending, what better way to start than downloading and using a free, open 
source personal finance application? Money Manager Ex is simple, without a lot of bells and 
whistles—but then again, you may not want more than that from your financial software.
Money Manager Ex shows you how much money you have in the bank, where you’re 
spending it, and what’s coming in. It allows you to import CSV files from your bank, and gives 
you a simple list of reports that are easy to understand. And if you’re doing some investing, 
you can experiment with the investment options the software offers.

Gaming
The applications I cover in this book can make your life easier or more efficient, but most 
people wouldn’t label them as entertaining. Okay, maybe some of you actually laugh out loud 
when you use a word processor, and I’m sure that one or two readers design spreadsheets as a 
hobby. But let’s be honest—for many of us, computers are all about the games.
The advances made in graphics and sound technology, combined with the lightning 
speeds of today’s processors, memory, and hard drives, have transformed gaming into a 
powerhouse industry. The money you save on software by using the applications covered in 
this book can buy you more of that advanced hardware, which means more advanced game 
playing! 
New games are released each year for every interest. Enjoy racing cars? There are Formula 
1 simulator applications that put you behind the wheel. Wish you could pilot your own X-Wing 
Fighter and take out the dreaded Death Star? Dozens of games for your computer are based on 
the wildly successful Star Wars movie franchise. And the list doesn’t end there: board games 
(try winning Monopoly against the computer—good luck!), strategy, shoot-’em-up, and role-
playing games are just a sampling.
Thousands of free games are available for download over the Internet. If you have a favor-
ite type of game, it’s out there and just a few clicks away. Just do a search for “Free computer 
games,” and be prepared to spend hours sifting through all the available options. Sure, many 
of these are low-quality games, but you can also find plenty of high-quality games, too. You 
don’t need to spend money for great games. Are you doubtful? In this chapter, I’ll recommend 
a game that will convince you that free games are just as fun as their pay-to-play counterparts. 
As usual, let’s begin with the commercial software to compare with the free version. In 
this case, that’s World of Warcraft.
The Defender
In the world of computer gaming right now, one game stands out among them all: World of 
Warcraft (WoW). WoW is legendary in the gaming community. If you don’t know someone 
who plays this game and have never heard of it, continue reading for a brief description.
WoW is a fantasy-based, role-playing, massively multiplayer online (MMO) game. This 
means that the game takes place in a fantasy world (named Azeroth) filled with wizards, war-
riors, priests, elves, dungeons, treasure, dragons, orcs, gold-laden chests, magical swords, and 
more. (So much more that entire books have been written about WoW.) Figure 12-1 shows one 
view of WoW.

Players of the game create what is called a character (the role-playing portion of the 
game), an in-game persona that interacts with other players, fights monsters, collects trea-
sure, and increases in power and skills the more you play. All characters start at Level 1, 
which gives you some basic skills (such as sword-wielding or spell-casting) and health (how 
much damage you can take from monsters before your character is killed and then resur-
rected). Your character’s skills and health increase (as do the values of treasures and the 
hazards from monsters) as you ascend through the levels. All of this happens in a shared-
world environment, where other players appear on the screen when they are in your vicinity. 
You can talk to other players (via the keyboard or a microphone), fight with them, and band 
together with them to fight a common enemy. You can also buy, trade, and sell in-game 
items such as swords, armor, and healing potions. (For more details on WoW, visit its official 
web site at dppl6++sss*sknh`kbs]n_n]bp*_ki.)

WHAT’S AN MMO?
A massively multiplayer online (MMO) game is massive because it usually consists of a virtual world you 
can explore. The multiplayer part means that you’re sharing the world with other game players. While you’re 
exploring the virtual world, you’ll see other players on the screen when they are in the same area as your 
character (inside a castle, for example). And online means that all of this happens while you are logged in to a 
game via an Internet connection. 
Combine all these elements, and you have a game with a large explorable world, inhabited by fellow 
game players, that is always “running.” It’s not uncommon for you to log in to your game during the day and 
find that it is nighttime in the virtual world. Likewise, most games continue to operate even when you’re not 
logged in, so your character is typically considered to be sleeping or practicing skills while you are away. 
MMO games have a variety of themes. There are superhero MMO games, where you create a hero 
who dodges bullets, jumps skyscrapers, and saves the day (or where you create a villain who is never up to 
any good, robbing banks and building evil robots to terrorize the city). Many MMO games are fantasy-based. 
Others take place in the far future with star travel, planetary bases, and space battles. If you can think of a 
specific type of MMO game, there’s a very good chance it exists, and you can join the game, where you will 
find other players who share your interests.
WoW is huge, with more than 11 million players. Yes, you read that correctly. And those 
players all pay a monthly fee to play. By charging approximately $15 per month to play, WoW 
is generating over $165 million dollars per month in revenue (although many people think it’s 
even higher with tie-ins like posters, books, and figurines). WoW brings in the money because 
it’s a lot of fun, with plenty of activities in the game.
Players particularly enjoy WoW because it continues to expand and grow. The software 
developers are always adding new content, such as quests for players to accept, treasures, 
monsters, and territories to explore. As of this writing, a new expansion pack (selling for 
around $40) adds an entirely new continent, and characters can grow to Level 80!
There’s no denying the popularity of WoW, but the recurring cost to play has prompted 
some players to leave the game. If you play a few hours each day, the monthly cost is probably 
not unreasonable. But for more casual players, spending $180 or more per year to play a single 
game probably seems a little crazy. And that’s why, after a few months of play, I canceled my 
subscription and said good-bye to my Level 17 wizard. Then I began my search for something 
that would allow me to continue my battle against evil and give me some deep, dark dungeons 
to explore with friends from around the world.
My search was not in vain. I found a small company in Germany named Frogster that 
offers an MMO game very similar (some might say extremely similar) to WoW. Not only is this 
game completely free, it’s also just as much fun as WoW.

The Contender
The gaming alternative I found is called Runes of Magic. It has many of the same features 
I enjoyed in WoW, along with some new ones.
Runes of Magic takes place in the land of Taborea. You, as the player, begin your jour-
ney by creating a character and selecting a single class (sort of like a career)—Warrior, Mage, 
Rogue, Scout, Priest, or Knight—with which to play, fight, and explore.
The first time you open Runes of Magic, you’ll have the opportunity to select your charac-
ter’s gender and body design, such as hair, face, arm, and leg sizes. You drag the small bars left 
and right to decrease or increase sizes of body parts (such as the legs). The pull-down menus 
allow you to select your class, gender, skin color, and hair color. The clothing you start with 
is very basic, but as the game progresses, you will be given the chance to add more colorful 
items, such as magic robes, leather and plate armor, and more. Figure 12-2 shows a Runes of 
Magic character being created.
Figure 12-2. You can customize your character’s look any way you like.
After creating your character’s look, provide a name, and click the Confirm button. You 
will then see your character on screen above a button labeled Enter World. Click the button, 
and you’re ready to begin.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING
231
If you think creating the look of your character is fun, wait until you play the game! This 
game has an overall story about the land of Taborea and many subplots that you can investi-
gate with your in-game character. You’ll fight horrible monsters, join with fellow adventurers 
to explore ominous dungeons, and collect treasures. Along the way, you can acquire more 
powerful armor, stronger spells, and more potent potions and weapons.
And because Frogster releases periodic updates to the game (for free), you’ll always find 
new lands to visit, new skills to acquire and use, and much more. There’s enough entertain-
ment in Runes of Magic to keep you occupied for a long time.
NNote How can a company like Frogster make a game like Runes of Magic free? They do it by offering 
what is called an online mall. As you fight monsters and complete quests, you’ll gain treasures—armor, 
weapons, and potions are just a few of the items you can find. But if you would like to get that super-power-
ful sword without all the work, Frogster gives you the ability to purchase such items using real-world money. 
Frogster states that any item that can be purchased from the online mall is also attainable by performing 
certain quests or defeating special monsters in the game. You can spend the time in the game to find the 
treasure, or spend some money to have that treasure now. If you want that fancy, glowing Sword of Infinite 
Tuchus-Kicking, you can just buy it, rather than spend hours fighting random monsters in the hopes of find-
ing it hidden in an old treasure chest. The money from the online mall pays for salaries and improvements to 
the game. Frogster claims it will always keep Runes of Magic free to play.
I must be careful not to reveal too much about the game, because it might spoil some sur-
prises for you. Later in the chapter, I’ll show you some basic activities you can perform in the 
game, but the real fun is simply playing. The next sections explain how to download and install 
the software so you can get started.
Where to Get the Software
Follow these simple steps to download Runes of Magic:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*nqjaokbi]ce_*_ki.
 
2. Click the Register Here Now button to sign up and download the latest version.
NNote Runes of Magic is a large download—more than 5GB! You need a broadband Internet (DSL or cable) 
connection to get it. Don’t even attempt to download this game using a dial-up connection.

Notes on Runes of Magic Installation
Installing Runes of Magic is quite easy. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Double-click the RoM icon to start the Setup Wizard, as shown in Figure 12-3. Click the 
Next button to proceed.
Figure 12-3. Install Runes of Magic on your PC.
 
2. Read through the license agreement, select the option labeled “I accept the agree-
ment,” and click the Next button.
 
3. On the next screen, you will be shown the location on your hard drive where the game 
will be installed. Click the Next button, and the installation will begin.
Once the game installation is complete, either double-click the shortcut placed on your 
desktop or select Runes of Magic from the Start menu. When you see the startup screen shown 
in Figure 12-4, click the Start Game button, and you’re ready to begin.
NNote Don’t let the “Beta” in the figures in this chapter worry you. As I’m writing this chapter, the game is 
still in beta testing, but an official release will be available by the time you’re reading this book.
The first time you play, you’ll be offered entrance to a beginner’s instruction zone. Click 
the Enter into button, and follow the on-screen instructions to learn how to walk, run, pan the 
camera around, and accept quests.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING

Figure 12-4. Click the Start Game button, and you’re ready to play.
A Sampling of Runes of Magic Activities
Here, I’ll go over a handful of Runes of Magic activities. These are fairly basic because, well, 
I just don’t want to give away any big secrets. It’s a fun game, and there are many surprises in 
store for you.
Accept a Quest
Quests are one of the key activities you’ll be performing in Runes of Magic. Quests are typically 
special actions that are given to you by nonplayer characters (NPCs). These are characters in 
the game who push the game’s overall story forward. Your quests are frequently smaller bits of 
a larger story, which you will learn more about as you progress in the game.
During the first-time user’s tutorial, you’ll be instructed how to accept, fulfill, and fin-
ish quests. Every time you complete a quest, your character earns experience points (XPs). 
When you’ve obtained a sufficient amount of XPs, your character will increase in level. This 
will increase your hit points (HPs, or health) and your mana points (MPs), which are used for 
casting spells and performing special actions other than fighting. You’ll need those increases 
in HPs and MPs in order to accept more challenging quests and to explore lands farther away 
from home.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING
234
Thousands of quests exist in Runes of Magic, and they run from the extremely easy 
(deliver this note) to the unbelievably difficult (slay the dragon using only this magic dagger). 
You can accept multiple quests and attempt them in any order you like. 
NTip Try to find quests that require defeating monsters. This way, you’ll get XPs from them, as well as 
from finishing the quest.
Follow these steps to be assigned a quest and collect your reward upon completing it:
 
1. Approach an NPC with a large yellow exclamation point over his or her head, as shown 
in Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5. NPCs with quests are easy to find—look for the exclamation point.
 
2. Double-click the NPC, and a list of available quests will be provided, as shown in 
Figure 12-6.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING
235
Figure 12-6. Some NPCs have more than one quest for you to accept.
 
3. Click an available quest to read details about it. If you wish to accept the quest, click 
the Accept Quest button, as shown in Figure 12-7. You can view your accepted quests 
by pressing the L key. Checking the box next to a quest will put the status of the quest 
on the screen to the right of your character, as shown in Figure 12-8.
 
4. Go and perform the quest.

her head, as shown in Figure 12-9.

experience points (XPs) and gold.
 
6. Double-click the NPC, and then click the Complete Quest button. The NPC will award 
you XP, gold, and possibly a treasure item or two, as shown in Figure 12-10.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING
238
Figure 12-10. After completing a quest, sometimes the NPC will have additional quests.
Rent a Mount (Horse)
While your character can run and walk, a faster option to get where you’re going is to rent a 
horse. Most towns have a stable master who will rent you a horse for 900 gold pieces, as shown 
in Figure 12-11. It’s a bit pricey, but consider that using a horse saves time as well as helps to 
get you past nasty monsters quickly, so they’re less likely to attack you.
Once you’ve rented the horse, press the B key to view your bag. Right-click the saddle 
icon, wait a few seconds, and you’ll find your character on a fast mount, ready to go, as shown 
in Figure 12-12.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING

Figure 12-12. You’ll find a saddle in your bag that you can use to mount your horse.

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING
240
Change Weapons
Sometimes, after defeating a monster, you will obtain a new weapon or more powerful armor; 
other times, you’ll find healing potions and other items. If you find a new weapon that your 
class can use (wizards, for example, cannot use swords), click the C key to view your char-
acter’s equipment, and then click the B key to open your bag. This brings up your character 
sheet, as shown in Figure 12-13. Here, a check indicates your character can use a weapon, 
armor, or item in that slot.
Figure 12-13. Open your character sheet and bag to view your equipped and carried items.
In the example in Figure 12-14, my character has found a new sword in his bag. If I move 
the mouse over the sword, I can see its details (how much damage it does, for example) and 
the details of my currently equipped weapon. Because this new sword does slightly more dam-
age, I simply drag and drop it over the old sword, and the items switch positions.

Investigate Further
Runes of Magic isn’t the only free MMO game available. Here are some others that you might 
enjoy:
s Crime Craft (dppl6++sss*_neia_n]bp*_ki+): Maybe you have a bit of bad guy in you. If 
so, you might like Crime Craft. This is a new, free-to-play MMO game that puts you in 
the shoes of some not-so-nice characters. Your character may be a thief or gang leader, 
so you can see where this is going. It’s not for everyone, but if you would like to knock 
over a virtual bank, give Crime Craft a shot.
s Shaiya (dppl6++od]eu]*]ane]c]iao*_ki): Similar to Runes of Magic, this game lets you 
create a character that fights, explores, and collects. And just like Runes of Magic, it 
also offers an online mall, where you can purchase some items without the hassle of 
fighting a bunch of monsters for them.
And if MMO games are just not your thing, check out this web site:
dppl6++sss*c]iaon]`]n*_ki+b+/21)`]uo)kb)bnaa)c]iao+]).,,4,3-3-0.5/-5,,,,
Yes, it’s a long address to type, but you’ll find 365 free games to play (a huge variety with 
some played online and some requiring a download)—plenty to keep you busy for a year!
Summary
I showed you just a few things you can do in the Runes of Magic game. There are thousands 
of quests and activities you’ll encounter as you play. You’ll team up with other players to take 
on large, menacing monsters (as well as obtain powerful treasures if you defeat them). You’ll 

CHAPTER 12 N  GAMING
242
explore deep dungeons and learn more about the ancient evil that has awakened in the land, 
and that you (and other players) must fight to purge.
Along the way, you’ll discover mysteries to solve, NPCs to deal with, and monsters to 
fight (or run from if they’re too powerful). Skills you’ll learn early in the game include how to 
communicate with other players using the in-game text window, how to navigate the world of 
Taborea using maps that can be called up simply by pressing the M key, and how to upgrade 
your fighting or spell-casting skills so you can take on meaner, more powerful foes.
MMO games are not going away. Players enjoy the ability to escape the real world for a 
while and join in a common goal of fighting monsters; exploring ancient castles; and collecting 
magical weapons, armor, and potions. Have fun!

Photo Management
I love my digital camera. I’m not a professional photographer, so I gave up using film a long 
time ago. Instead, I purchased a large capacity memory stick/card (1GB of storage), so I can 
take pictures all day without worrying about running out of film or storage space. And with 
software such as GIMP (see Chapter 7) and Inkscape (see Chapter 8), I’m able to make all kinds 
of interesting modifications to my photos.
But there is one big problem I have with my digital photos, and maybe you have it, too: 
organizing all those photos and keeping track of them. When I’m looking in the Iu Le_pqnao 
folder on my PC, with more than 2,000 digital pictures, I would sure like to be able to quickly 
find only those that have my son in them from last month’s vacation at the beach. Unfortu-
nately, I must rely on looking at thumbnails (those small icons that you have to squint at to see 
any details) or resort to opening and viewing each photo file to locate particular pictures.
Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to search through all your digital photos the way you search 
for keywords using Google? Well, you’re in luck. A great application named Picasa can help 
you organize your photos, plus a whole lot more. And it’s 100% free.
What Is Picasa?
Picasa allows you to organize, edit, and share your digital photos. You can also rate photos 
(using a star system), add tags (keywords for searching), and even create gift CDs for friends 
and family. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to built-in features. For exam-
ple, one feature I use almost every time I upload photos is red-eye reduction (which I’ll cover 
in this chapter). Picasa is an extremely easy-to-use application, and you’ll appreciate it more 
and more as your digital photo collection grows.
Picasa is owned by Google and is currently free to download and use. It’s available in 
more than 35 languages for Windows, Linux, and Mac systems.
Where Can I Find Picasa?
Picasa is an application that you download and install on your computer. It takes up about 
45MB of hard drive space. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Visit dppl6++le_]o]*ckkcha*_ki+ and click the Download Picasa 3 button.
 
2. Download the setup file and double-click it.
 
3. Click the I agree button after reading the license agreement.
243

CHAPTER 13 N  PHOTO MANAGEMENT
244
 
4. Leave the default installation location, or change the folder by clicking the Browse but-
ton. Click the Install button to begin the installation.
 
5. You may want to uncheck some of the boxes (such as creating a desktop icon or add-
ing a Quick Launch icon) on the final installation screen. Read through the options and 
decide what to leave checked before clicking the Finish button.
How Do I Use Picasa?
The first time you open and run Picasa, you’re asked to allow Picasa to perform a complete 
scan of your computer or just your desktop, Iu @k_qiajpo, and Iu Le_pqnao folders. It’s looking 
for photos that include the following formats: JPG, BMP, GIF, TIF, PSD, and TIF. Be aware that 
a complete scan can take a while (on my computer, this initial scan took almost 25 minutes).
The first time you open and run Picasa, you’ll also be asked if you would like to use the 
Picasa Viewer application to view all images files. You can configure Picasa Viewer to auto-
matically open files by selecting any or all of the following formats: JPG, TIF, BMP, GIF, TGA, 
and RAW. If you choose not to configure Picasa Viewer, double-clicking a file will open it in 
whatever default application is assigned.
Next, you’ll be presented with a window similar to the one shown in Figure 13-1. Along 
the left edge is a list of the folders on your hard drive that contain digital images. When you 
click a folder, the photos in that folder are displayed in the area on the right.
Figure 13-1. Picasa organizes your images using folders.
To view a larger version of a picture, simply double-click the photo. The photo will appear 
on the right, and tabs with specialized tools for editing are presented on the left, as shown in 
Figure 13-2. Using the tools on the Basic Fixes tab, you can crop photos, reduce red eye, and 

CHAPTER 13 N  PHOTO MANAGEMENT
245
experiment with different color settings. The Tuning tab and the Effects tab offer even more 
tweaks for you to perform on your photos. And don’t worry about making a mistake while 
you’re making changes to your photos, because you can always click the Undo button to get 
back your original photo!
NTip You might want to click the I’m Feeling Lucky button in the Basic Tab immediately. It can do some 
amazing cleanup on a photo, including fixing lighting issues and sharpening details.
Figure 13-2. Picasa offers numerous editing options.
Use the Photo Tray
Picasa has something called the Photo Tray, which appears in the lower-left corner of the 
window. It allows you to build a virtual album of selected photos.
When you click a photo, it will be added to the Photo Tray; you can jump from one photo 
in the Photo Tray to the next, without hunting through the Picasa database again. This is a nice 
feature when you have hundreds, or even thousands, of photos on your hard drive and wish to 
keep a small batch together for sharing, printing, or e-mailing. 
After you’ve added photos to the Photo Tray, you can use the buttons along the lower-
right edge of the Picasa window to do something with the group, as shown in Figure 13-3. For 
example, if you click the Email button, Picasa will allow you to e-mail the collection of photos 
in your Photo Tray. It adds the photos as attachments using your default e-mail application. 

CHAPTER 13 N  PHOTO MANAGEMENT
246
Other options for the Photo Tray include creating a separate photo album, burning the photos 
to a CD/DVD, printing the photos on your printer, and ordering prints online.
Figure 13-3. Use the Photo Tray to print, e-mail, and order collections of selected photos.
Tag Photos
An important task that you can (and should) do for all your photographs is to tag them. Tag-
ging is simply adding keywords to your photographs (they won’t actually appear on the image) 
to make them searchable. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Select a photo by double-clicking it in the folder list in Picasa. This will open the photo.
 
2. Directly underneath the photo, you should see the words “Make a caption,” as shown 
in Figure 13-4. Click these words.
Figure 13-4. Tagging your digital photos will make future searches quick and easy.
 
3. Type in the best description possible. Include names, locations, dates, and any other 
words you can think of that describe the photo. In Figure 13-5, you can see that I’ve 
entered details about the event, plus the year and the location (haircut, 2009, Atlanta). 
 
4. When you’re finished, repeat steps 1 through 3 to tag your other photos (there’s no 
Save button to click). You can also click the Next button to move to the next photo, or 
select a photo from the main window and press Ctrl+K to tag it.

CHAPTER 13 N  PHOTO MANAGEMENT
247
Figure 13-5. Use as many descriptive words as possible when adding a caption.
Now, the next time my in-laws come for a visit and my wife asks me to show them photos 
of our son’s latest haircut, I can simply open Picasa and type in a keyword such as “haircut.” 
Then only those photos that contain that word will show up, as shown in Figure 13-6. This is 
much easier than flipping through a directory of hundreds of photos named something like 
@O?J,,,-,*FLC, which digital cameras have the tendency to create.
Figure 13-6. Use keywords to search through your digital photos.

CHAPTER 13 N  PHOTO MANAGEMENT
248
Yes, tagging can take a while as you go through a large collection of digital photos, but the 
good news is that you don’t need to do it all at once. Just set aside a few half-hour blocks of 
time, and tag as many photos as you can. (My editor suggested having a “tagging party” by let-
ting family members view and tag photos as they take a trip down memory lane—a nice way to 
share the work!) Eventually, you’ll end up with captions added to all your digital photos. 
You should also develop the habit of opening Picasa after uploading a collection of photos 
to your computer and immediately adding captions. Staying on top of your tagging will pay 
large dividends later when you’re looking for that single photo buried on your hard drive. 
NTip You can tag multiple photos by selecting one photo, selecting additional photos with Ctrl-click, and 
then clicking the Tag button or pressing Ctrl+K to tag them all with the same text. This also works for select-
ing multiple photos for printing.
Once you’ve tagged a good array of photos, you can see how powerful the search feature 
is. For instance, suppose you want to find pictures of your dog during holidays. You can search 
for “dog Christmas,” and Picasa will show you all the photos that have tags containing the 
words “dog” and “Christmas.” Notice that you don’t need to separate keywords with a comma.
More Great Picasa Features
“What else can you do with Picasa?” you ask. Here, I’ll go over some sample tasks to get you 
started. Of course, you’ll want to investigate and experiment with the software to discover all 
the features Picasa has to offer.
Back Up Your Photos
After you’ve spent all that time organizing and tagging your photos, it would be a shame to 
lose your photos. Fortunately, Picasa offers you the ability to back up your photos by burning 
them to a CD or DVD. Here’s how:
 
1. Select Tools ° Backup Pictures. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see the backup 
steps, as shown in Figure 13-7. 
 
2. You can use the default set name (My Backup Set) or enter a new name in Box 1 by 
clicking the New Set button and providing the name. 
 
3. Place a check box next to each folder you wish to back up to CD/DVD along the left col-
umn, or click the Select All button (see Figure 13-7).
 
4. Picasa will add up the storage space needed and display how many CDs or DVDs will 
be required. Click the Burn button when you’re ready to start (and have your CDs or 
DVDs ready).

CHAPTER 13 N  PHOTO MANAGEMENT
249
Figure 13-7. Back up your photos to CD or DVD to prevent loss of your pictures.
NTip If you would prefer to keep a backup of your photos somewhere other than on a CD/DVD, here’s 
a suggestion: select Tools ° Upload ° Upload to Web Albums. You will be asked to provide your Google 
account name and password (or create one) before you can use the free service. Web Albums allows you to 
upload your photos for viewing over the Internet. You can limit who can view your photos, so consider this an 
option for not only backing up your photos, but also for making them available to friends and family.
Eliminate Duplicate Photos
Over time, I’ve copied photos from one folder to another, and I’ve also occasionally imported 
photos from old memory cards that are already on my hard drive. Besides taking up hard drive 
space, having duplicates also takes up my time as I sift through photos before tagging them. If 
you’ve also ended up with more than one copy of a photo, you will appreciate Picasa’s dupli-
cate photo search capability. Here’s how to remove duplicates:
 
1. Select Tools ° Experimental ° Show Duplicate Files, as shown in Figure 13-8.
 
2. Picasa will display the duplicate photos it finds. For example, in Figure 13-9, the 
rightmost picture in the folder called Gahhu Ldkpk and the rightmost picture in the 
folder called @a_ .4 have the same file name and are duplicates. If you truly need 
both images, you can just leave them on your computer. Otherwise, right-click one 
of the images and choose Delete from Disk to eliminate the duplicate. 
 
3. When you’re finished clearing out duplicates, click the green Exit Search button at the 
top of the photo display.

Create Your Own Screen Saver
Picasa has a nice built-in screen-saver ability that lets you add and remove photos as often as 
you like. As shown in Figure 13-10, Screensaver is an album in Picasa’s Albums list. You can

Remove Red Eye from a Digital Photo
One of the biggest problems I have with my photos is red eye. My camera has a red-eye 
removal feature, but sometimes I forget to use it. Fortunately for me, Picasa has an easy-to-use 
feature for reducing red eye, which works as follows:
 
1. Open a picture that contains a red-eyed monster—maybe a picture of a mother-in-law 
(just kidding!). 
 
2. Click the Redeye button in the Basic Fixes tab, as shown in Figure 13-12.
Figure 13-12. Use the Redeye tool to clean up red eye.
 
3. Hold down the mouse button and drag a small box around the offending eye. Try 
to make the box as small as possible but large enough to surround the entire eye, 
as shown in Figure 13-13. Then release the mouse button, and the red eye will be 
removed. 
 
4. Click the Cancel button if you don’t like the look of the modified photo. Otherwise, 
click the Back to Library link in the upper-right corner to save the change and return to 
your photos.

Investigate Further
In addition to Picasa, another free digital photo management tool worth mentioning is Flickr 
(dppl6++sss*bhe_gn*_ki). Flickr is an online management service, with features similar to 
Picasa’s. Because it’s online, you’ll be storing, editing, tagging, and performing other tasks 
using your web browser.
Flickr does offer a downloadable tool that makes uploading your photos easy, but its real 
power resides in its ability to share photos. You control who has the ability to view individual 
pictures or groups of images.
Flickr is a nice alternative to Picasa, especially if you’re running out of hard drive space. 
It offers a free membership with a maximum storage size of 200 images. If you want to store 
more, you’ll pay a small yearly fee for the Pro Membership, which allows unlimited storage 
and uploads.

Summary
Picasa is one of the most powerful little applications I’ve ever used, and the fact that it’s free 
makes it even better. It makes organizing and tagging your digital photo collection easy. I 
suggest that you take advantage of this great tool and get control of your photos, so you can 
always find what you need in a hurry.
And don’t think that Picasa’s only useful for removing red eye and tagging your photos. 
It has many other features you should try. Click the Create menu, and you’ll see that you can 
make a poster to print, order prints online, and even publish photos to a blog.

Internet Phone Calls
I have friends all over the world, and e-mail has been a blessing when it comes to staying in 
touch with them. Yet, sometimes an e-mail message is just no substitute for picking up the 
phone and calling someone to say hello.
But then the confusion sets in. What time does my unlimited long-distance service start 
in the evening? How much does it cost to call Europe during business hours? Is Dan part of my 
mobile phone network so I can call him for free? Trying to keep up with all the rules, limita-
tions, and costs can drive a person crazy.
To the rescue comes this great little piece of software called Skype, which allows you to 
talk for free, at any time and anywhere you have Internet access. All you need is a headset, the 
free software installed, and a friend who uses Skype as well.
What Is Skype?
In a nutshell, Skype is software that allows you to talk to anyone in the world over your Inter-
net connection. Skype is free, easy to download and install, and simple to use. You can talk 
with another Skype user freely for as long as you like. There are charges if you want to call a 
mobile phone or landline phone, but those costs are low, and you can pay as you go.
Other features include the ability to send instant messages to other Skype users, have a 
conference call with up to 24 other people, place a video call if you have a webcam, and import 
your contacts from other address books.
Skype offers plenty of additional pay-to-use features, but the basic, free service is all that 
most people will ever need. It’s available for Windows, Linux, Mac, and other platforms (such 
as your mobile phone).
255

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
256
OF HEADSETS AND MICROPHONES
To use Skype, you need a headset. You can purchase one at a local computer store or find plenty of options 
online. If you’re just using it for Skype, you don’t need to spend a lot of money on a headset with bells and 
whistles. Just make sure it has jacks that fit into your computer’s microphone and headphone ports. Headsets 
typically have two jacks: one for the microphone port and one for a speaker/headphones port, like the head-
set in this photo:
Laptops with built-in speakers also sometimes come with a built-in microphone. You’ll need to check 
your hardware to determine if you already have a microphone. Built-in microphones are often muted by 
default. To check and change this setting, open the Sound/Audio applet in the Control Panel, select the Vol-
ume tab, and click the Advanced button. If the Mute box is checked for Microphone, simply uncheck it.
Where Can I Find Skype?
Skype is free to download but does require a high-speed Internet connection to use. You can 
obtain the software by following these steps:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*ogula*_ki+jaspkogula+ and click the Download Skype button.
 
2. Follow the instructions to download the setup file and double-click it to install the 
software.
 
3. Select your language, place a check in the box to acknowledge your agreement 
to adhere to the license agreement, and then click the Install button to begin the 
installation.
 
4. After the installation is completed, click the Start Skype button.

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
257
How Do I Use Skype?
When Skype opens for the first time, you’ll be asked to create a new Skype account. This is a 
simple procedure:
 
1. In the first Create account window, enter your full name, a Skype name (this will be 
what you provide other Skype users), and a password, as shown in Figure 14-1. Place a 
check in the box to acknowledge that you accept the license agreement, and then click 
the Next button.
Figure 14-1. Create your Skype account by providing a few pieces of information.
 
2. In the next window, shown in Figure 14-2, provide an e-mail address, select your coun-
try or region, and enter your city name. If you leave the “Sign me in when Skype starts” 
box checked, Skype will always log you in when you start the program. If you uncheck 
the box, you’ll need to log in to start using Skype. Click the Sign In button when you’ve 
filled in the information.

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
258
Figure 14-2. Provide e-mail and location information, and you’re ready to start Skype.
 
3. Skype will take a few moments to create your account. When it finishes, plug in your 
headset, and then click the Start button to take a tutorial on using Skype and make a 
test call.
 
4. During the test call, you’ll be asked to record a short message that will be played back 
to you. If you’re able to record and hear the message, you’re ready to start using Skype. 
In order to use Skype, you’ll need someone to call. This means adding someone to your 
Contact list.
Add Contacts
The people who you call with Skype must also be using Skype if you wish the call to be free. 
(Skype charges a small fee to call landline and mobile phones.) If you don’t know anyone who 
uses Skype, you’ll need to encourage friends and family members to download and install 
Skype. Once they’ve done this, just ask them for their Skype name (refer back to Figure 14-1). 
With that information, here’s how you add them to your Contact list:
 
1. Start Skype and log in.
 
2. Click the New button and select the New Contact option, as shown in Figure 14-3.
 
3. The Add a Contact window will open, as shown in Figure 14-4. Enter the Skype name 
for your contact in the text field and click the Find button.

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
259
Figure 14-3. Click New Contact to begin building your Contact list.
Figure 14-4. Search for the Skype name and add that person to your Contact list.

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
260
 
4. If the name is a valid Skype name, it will appear in the search results list. Click the cor-
rect name (if there are multiple names, use the location to find the proper person), and 
then click the Add Skype Contact button. 
 
5. Optionally, you can enter a message to let your new contact know that you’ve added 
him to your Contact list, and then click the Send button to send it. Click the Close but-
ton to add the contact without sending a message.
Your new contact should appear in the Skype application’s Contact list, as shown in Fig-
ure 14-5. Now all that’s left is to make a phone call.
NNote Your contacts have their own Contact lists, which can also be made available to you. This is useful 
in a large work environment when you need to reach someone but don’t have them in your own Contact list.
Figure 14-5. Your contacts are listed in the Contact list.
Make a Call
To make a call, start by locating the person you wish to call in your Contact list. To the right of 
the person’s name, you’ll see a small green Call button (with an icon representing a phone). 
Put on your headset, and then click that button.
You’ll hear some beeps at first. When the person you are calling answers, just start talking. 
You’re having an Internet phone call! 
NCaution Some Skype users consider it rude to be contacted via Skype without a text message, chat 
message, or e-mail notice first. Because Skype requires you to be sitting in front of your computer, it’s best 
to give your contact a heads-up and ask her if it’s a good time to call. 

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
261
More Skype Functionality
In case you’re wondering, Skype does more than provide free phone calls. Here, I’ll introduce 
you to a few of the other free services built into this application.
Send Text Messages to Your Contacts
You’re already familiar with the little green button you click to make a call. Now look in the 
lower-right corner of the window, and you’ll see a little text box that allows you to send an 
instant message to a contact. Type your message, as shown in Figure 14-6, and then press the 
Enter key to send it.
Figure 14-6. The Chat window 
Messages between persons will queue up on the screen, with the most recent message 
at the bottom, as shown in Figure 14-7. If the recipient is logged in to Skype, he can respond 
to your message immediately by typing in a response. If the recipient is not available at the 
moment, the message will be waiting for him to read when he next logs in to Skype, and he can 
reply with his own message.
Figure 14-7. If your contact is away or busy, the instant message will still be delivered.
Set Your Status
To set your status from Online to Away to let others know you’re unavailable for a call or chat, 
click the small down arrow next to your Skype name, as shown in Figure 14-8. This list offers 
Away, Do Not Disturb, and other status options. After you make a selection, anyone trying to 
call or send you a message will see your status.

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
262
Figure 14-8. Set your status with Skype so your contacts can see if you are busy or available.
Make a Video Phone Call
If you have a webcam in addition to your headset, you can provide a live video of yourself to 
whomever you call with Skype. It’s even better if the person you’re calling also has a webcam 
so the two of you can talk face to face, but that’s not required. 
To set up Skype for video calls, plug in your webcam, and then open Skype. Select Tools ° 
Options. In the Skype Options window, click the Video Settings tab, as shown in Figure 14-9.
Figure 14-9. Configure Skype to use your webcam using the Options window.

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
263
If your camera is working properly, you should see an image of yourself. Beneath that 
image are settings for who you can automatically receive a video call from, as well as who 
knows you have video capabilities. I suggest accepting the default of receiving video only from 
your known contacts. (You don’t want strangers calling you up with their webcams turned on 
and doing who knows what, right?)
Once you’ve made your selections in the Options window, click the Save button. A new 
Video call button will be added in Skype, as shown in Figure 14-10.
NTip You can also block anyone but those in your Contact list from placing phone calls to you. Select Tools 
° Options. In the Options window, click the Calls tab along the left edge of the window. Make sure the option 
labeled “Only allow people in my Contact List to call me” is selected.
Figure 14-10. When a webcam is detected, a new Video call button is available.
Click the Video call button for a contact, and when the call is connected, that person will 
be able to see your shiny, happy face. If you didn’t initially make a video call, click the Turn on 
Video button during a regular phone call to start the video, and keep talking.
Making a video call is a lot of fun. Just change out of your pajamas if it’s a business call, 
okay? 
Investigate Further
Once you understand the basics of using Skype, you’ll also want to investigate some of the 
add-ons that are available for it. Your first stop will be dpplo6++atpn]o*ogula*_ki+, where you 
can read reviews of various expansions to Skype. There are whiteboard tools, translators, and 
games that you can play with those you are calling. To find other add-ons, just do a Google 
search for “Skype add-ons.” You’ll find more extra features than you’ll have time to test—but 
that’s part of the fun of Skype.
Other Skype users have found that the application makes a nice monitoring tool for your 
home or office. You can read the article at dppl6++sss*i]gaqoakb*_ki+p]c+dks)pk)qoa)ogula)
]o)])_kranp)ojkklan+ to learn how to configure Skype for this kind of activity.
In addition to the Skype application, you might also consider faxing from your computer. 
Dozens of free services allow you to send and receive faxes. Unfortunately, some of them 
are limited to specific countries (for example, FaxZero allows you to send only within the 

CHAPTER 14 N  INTERNET PHONE CALLS
264
United States and Canada). Others will allow you to only receive faxes for free, and will charge 
to send faxes. Here are a couple United Stated–based options:
s FaxDigits (dppl6++sss*b]t`ecepo*_ki+): This service lets you receive unlimited faxes 
using a free fax number provided to you at sign-up. However, the number assigned 
might not be a local area code.
s FaxZero (dppl6++b]tvank*_ki+): This service allows you to send a maximum of two 
faxes per day (three pages per fax limit) anywhere in the United States or Canada. The 
cover sheet does contain an advertisement, but if you just need to send the occasional 
quick fax, this is a great free service.
If you need a faxing service that works outside the United States, a Google search should 
help you locate one.
Summary
If you like to talk to friends and family often, you should definitely encourage as many as pos-
sible to download and install Skype. The ability to speak for free, locally or internationally, is 
one of the unique features the Internet offers. If you have a high-speed Internet connection, 
the sound quality is excellent. And the ability to use a webcam lets you wave hello and say it at 
the same time!

Web Logs
You don’t have to write for a major newspaper to have your opinions shared with the world. 
And you definitely don’t need to come up with 300 pages for a best-selling book covering your 
favorite hobby. I could have titled this chapter “Become Famous Using Web Logs.” You might 
be surprised by the number of people who have built a reputation (and a fortune) by creat-
ing and writing a web log (or blog for short) of their own. Do a Google search for Matt Drudge, 
Paul Kos, and Glenn Reynolds to see how a few individuals turned their opinions into fame 
and fortune.
Blogs are everywhere. For some, a blog is an online diary, documenting thoughts and 
experiences for sharing with the world or keeping private. Businesses use blogs to share infor-
mation with customers and their employees in an informal way. Many people use blogs to 
track their favorite hobby, sports team, or whatever subject strikes them as possibly interesting 
to other people. While blogs can be kept private, they really shine when blog writers allow the 
general public to read their material and then add comments. In a sense, a blog writer pro-
vides something to talk about.
Gone are the days when you had to register a domain name (such as sss*
f]iaobhku`gahhupdkqcdpo*_ki) to maintain a web log; you don’t need to create an entire web 
site just to provide insightful commentary. The best part is that blogs are free, requiring no 
registration fees or hosting fees.
Maybe you have a hobby that you feel the world must know more about, or maybe you 
think that the media is overlooking some key position held by a political figure. The point is 
that if you have an opinion and want to share it with the rest of us, it’s a lot easier to create a 
blog for that purpose than to get your own TV show or publish on the back page of your favor-
ite magazine. And it all starts with a short visit to Blogger.
265

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
266
What Is Blogger?
Blogger is an online tool that will allow you to create a professional-looking web log, post your 
opinions and news, share pictures and video, accept reader comments, and more. Blogger falls 
into the Software as a Service (SaaS) category, because you’ll be doing all your writing using 
your web browser and the online tools made available to you by Blogger.
Blogger assigns you a web address (URL) in the form of dppl6++ukqn)^hkc)j]ia*^hkcolkp*
_ki, and this is the web site that readers will use to read your latest additions (called posts). 
Blogger also offers the ability for fans of your blog to “subscribe” to your blog. When you add 
a new item to the blog, subscribers will receive your latest post in their e-mail or newsreader.
Blogger is owned by Google and is free to use. All it requires is an Internet connection and 
a web browser. You provide the words, pictures, and video, and Blogger handles publishing it 
all for the world to see.
NNote How is Blogger able to provide its services to you at no cost? Google is covering the cost of Blogger 
by selling advertisements that appear on its search engine and other tools such as Gmail (see Chapter 6). 
Blogger will not display advertisements unless you choose to participate. If your blog becomes popular, you 
can elect to allow businesses to place small advertisements on your blog. Then you will get paid when visi-
tors to your blog click the advertisements. 
Where Can I Find Blogger?
Because Blogger is a SaaS, you don’t need to install anything to use it. Instead, you do every-
thing over the Web. Here’s how:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*^hkccan*_ki and click the Create a Blog button.
 
2. If you already have a Google account, click the “sign in first” link; otherwise, enter the 
required information (e-mail address, password, and so on). Read through the Terms 
of Service, and then check the box to acknowledge your agreement to those terms, as 
shown in the example in Figure 15-1. Then click the Continue button.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
267
Figure 15-1. Registering for Blogger is free and easy.
 
3. Next, you need to create a name for your blog and the blog address (URL). Enter your 
information, as shown in the example in Figure 15-2. Then click the Check Availability 
link to make certain your blog address is available. Once you have entered the required 
information, click the Continue button.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
268
Figure 15-2. Pick your blog’s name and give it an address that people can use to find your blog.
 
4. The final step in the blog-creation process allows you to choose a template style 
(design) for your blog, as shown in Figure 15-3. You can click the preview template link 
to see a larger version on your screen. Your template selection can be changed any 
time you like, so don’t worry about being locked into a design forever. Choose your 
template, and then click the Continue button.
 
5. Your blog has been created. Simply click the Start Blogging button to begin. 
For some crazy reason, when you start Blogger for the first time, you’re presented with a 
new screen, without any explanation of how to start. Don’t worry! I’ll show you the basics of 
using Blogger in the next section.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
269
Figure 15-3. Pick a look for your blog using the template samples provided.
How Do I Use Blogger?
At this point, you’ve just created a new blog. Blogger has opened, and you’re most likely seeing 
a screen like the one shown in Figure 15-4. It might look like a confusion of buttons to you, but 
trust me, it’s very easy to navigate and use. I’m going to walk through the steps of creating the 
very first blog post for my new blog, “Don’t Spend a Dime,” and use a few of the buttons, so 
you can see how easy this really is.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
270
Figure 15-4. It’s time to create your first blog post.
 
1. I want to welcome my readers to my blog, so I type in a bit of text, as shown in 
Figure 15-5.
 
2. It looks a little bland, so I’m going to use the first two tool buttons from the left to 
change the font and font size. I use my mouse to select the text, as shown in Figure 
15-6, and make my selections. From the Font drop-down list, I choose Trebuchet as my 
font. From the Font Size (denoted by the big and small T’s) drop-down list, I pick Large.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
272
 
3. The next three buttons from the left on the toolbar let you boldface, italicize, and 
change the color of any selected text. Just to demonstrate their use, I add some more 
text and apply these formats (see Figure 15-7).
 
4. I want to send my readers to my publisher’s web site if they want more information 
about the book. I can do this by adding a web link (or hyperlink). A web link works just 
like any link found in your web browser. It typically appears as a bit of blue underlined 
text. Clicking the link takes you to another web page. To add a web link to my blog, I 
select the book’s title and click the Link button in the toolbar, as shown in Figure 15-7. 
This pops up a window, in which I enter the publisher’s web address, as shown in Fig-
ure 15-8, and click the OK button. Now the book’s title appears underlined to indicate 
it is a hyperlink (see Figure 15-9).
Figure 15-7. Click the Link button to add a web link.

5. A small graphic or picture is always eye-catching for a blog post. You can insert a pic-
ture by clicking the Add Image button in the toolbar and browsing to a suitable image. 
The image must be less than 8MB in size and contained in a *flc, *^il, or *ceb file. I 
select an appropriate image, and it’s inserted on the page. I then resize it, as shown in 
Figure 15-9. I could also cut and paste it to any area on the page.
Figure 15-9. Add a photo or small graphic to your post to grab a reader’s attention.
 
6. I publish this post by clicking the Publish Post button at the bottom of the screen. 
 
7. I click the View Blog link at the top of the screen, and take a look at my first blog post, 
as shown in Figure 15-10.

Now I have a blog, and you can have one just as easily. But it gets better! Blogger offers 
even more features for you to investigate to make your new blog attractive (and useful) to 
readers. Up next, you’ll discover a few more things you can do with Blogger.
NNote In January 2006, I started a blog titled “The NXT Step” (dppl6++pdajtpopal*^hkcolkp*_ki) 
as a way for me to provide comments and feedback about my testing of a new LEGO product called LEGO 
MINDSTORMS NXT, a robot kit developed by the toy company. I provided pictures, my opinions, links to other 
web sites, designs, and more. The blog didn’t get its first comment from a reader for almost one month. But 
it was a start. As of January 2009, the blog has over three years of archives, more than 2,000 posts, and 
25+ contributors who I’ve invited to join me in adding content. The NXT Step blog consistently gets about 
50,000 visitors each month who check in to read about the latest news and developments in the world of 
LEGO robotics.

More Blogger Details
As your blog develops, you may find yourself needing to make some changes in its look and 
maybe how it provides information (also known in the blogging circles as content). One poten-
tial change I suggest is to modify your blog’s layout/design to give it more functionality and 
give your readers more reasons to visit your blog.
Modify the Blog Layout
Because your blog appears in a web browser, the basic template you chose when first creat-
ing your blog provides a decent design that will fit inside most web browser windows. But the 
templates don’t lock you into that format forever. You can make a complete template change 
that will modify the colors and locations of items such as posts. But if you like your existing 
template, you can make many adjustments to add to its usefulness to readers.
First, log in to Blogger if you aren’t already logged in. In the upper-right corner of the 
screen, click the link labeled Dashboard, as shown in Figure 15-11.
Figure 15-11. Modifying your blog template requires a trip to the Dashboard.
You should now see the Dashboard, similar to the one shown in Figure 15-12. Here, you 
can see how many posts you’ve made over the lifetime of the blog; the date of the last post; 
some buttons to modify your user profile; a button labeled New Post; and a bunch of links with 
names like Edit Posts, Settings, and Layout. 
You’ll want to experiment with all of these Dashboard items at some point, but for now, 
click the Layout link. It will take you to a screen that looks like the one shown in Figure 15-13. 
The screen will show the Page Elements tab, but there are three more tabs: Fonts and Colors, 
Edit HTML, and Pick New Template. Fonts and Colors is self-explanatory—simply click that 
tab, and you can experiment with different color schemes and see what they will look like on 
the sample image. Similarly, the Pick New Template tab will let you pick a completely different 
design. The Edit HTML page is useful, but I don’t recommend playing around with these set-
tings unless you know what you’re doing and are familiar with HTML, the “language” of web 
pages.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
276
Figure 15-12. The Dashboard is where you manage all of the blog’s settings.
Figure 15-13. The Layout tab will let you change the format of your blog.
On the Page Elements tab, you will see the overall layout of your current blog, shown in a 
simplified form. Each area of the screen, such as Blog Posts and About Me, is defined by a box. 
Each box has an Edit link that will allow you to change certain things about that section. (And 
be sure to click the Save button often to keep your changes and additions.)

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
277
For example, clicking the Blog Posts box’s Edit link opens the window shown in Fig-
ure 15-14. Here, you can make changes to the information displayed with each post, such as 
the date and how many comments and posts will be displayed per page.
Figure 15-14. Making changes to your posts is easy using the Blog Posts Edit link.
As time goes by, you’ll build up a large collection of blog posts (hopefully) that new read-
ers frequently like to visit and existing readers sometimes like to reread. Allowing your blog 
to build an archive—a collection of previous posts—and making it easy to navigate is done by 
using the Blog Archive box’s Edit link. This takes you to the Configure Blog Archive window, as 
shown in Figure 15-15.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
278
Figure 15-15. Make it easier for readers to find older posts in your blog archive.
Some templates have more features than the examples shown here, so don’t worry if you 
see more boxes available for editing. This just means your blog template has other features 
that can be implemented.
Note that Blogger always gives you the ability to cancel changes that you make by simply 
clicking the Cancel button in the edit windows. You don’t need to be afraid to test something 
and see how it looks, because you can always return to the default settings by clicking the 
Clear Edits button at the top of the screen (see Figure 15-13). 
Turn on AdSense to Make Money
I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that Google will let you host advertisements 
on your blog. If a visitor to your blog clicks one of the advertisements, you will earn a small 
commission!
Here’s how to turn on AdSense (Google’s advertisement application that pays you money 
when a visitor clicks a link to a paid advertiser) for your blog:

1. From your blog’s Dashboard, click the Layout tab to see a screen like the one shown in 
Figure 15-16. Then click the Add a Gadget link on the right side of the screen.

3. If this is the first time you’ve ever used AdSense, click the Create a New AdSense 
Account button, as shown in Figure 15-18. Then follow the instructions to configure 
how the ads will appear (color and size), as well as to set up payment options. If you 
already have an AdSense account, click the Use an Existing AdSense Account button 
instead.
Figure 15-18. You must create an AdSense account to receive payment from Google.
 
4. After you’ve set up your AdSense account, check your blog. You should see one or more 
advertisements displayed, as shown in the example in Figure 15-19.

Blogger has one major competitor: WordPress (dppl6++skn`lnaoo*knc). WordPress does 
require a small software download, but it offers most of the same features as Blogger, and it is 
also free. It has a slightly different user interface, but is still fairly easy to use. Blog writers tend 
to be fans of one or the other, so be sure to check out both Blogger and WordPress, and decide 
for yourself which web blog tool works best for you.

CHAPTER 15 N  WEB LOGS
281
And if you choose to use Blogger, be sure to look into the ability to use your mobile phone. 
Blogger offers the option to upload text and pictures directly from your mobile phone. This is a 
great way to document something such as a trip and provide your blog readers with up-to-the-
minute reports from the road. You can find more information about this service at the Blogger 
Mobile page (dppl6++sss*^hkccan*_ki+ik^eha)op]np*c).
Summary
Blogger is a powerful and fun blogging tool. It gives you the ability to write about your favorite 
cause, hobby, or other subject. The fact that it’s free makes it an application that you should 
certainly try out. Once you’ve become comfortable with your blog, you might want to inves-
tigate inviting others to contribute to your blog or maybe offering advertising space on your 
blog to generate some extra income. Blogger offers online help on these ideas and more at

Social Networking
Our lives seem to move so fast these days that even e-mail and mobile phones can’t prevent 
us from sometimes feeling insulated and out of touch. We take digital pictures of our vacation, 
but can’t seem to find the time to share them with our coworkers. We shoot video, but sending 
DVD copies to every family member is just too time-consuming. We change jobs; we move to 
a different town or city; we have a bad day. How do we keep the people in our lives informed 
and in touch?
Building a personal web page can help you publish pictures and share information like 
your new mailing address. But do you really want to spend hours every day updating your 
web site with the latest photos and news, or would you prefer a friendlier and faster method 
of keeping others up-to-date on your life? 
And let’s flip this around. How much work is involved if you want to track down an old 
school friend or an ex-coworker? People change phone numbers and e-mail addresses; they 
move; they get married and change their names.
In this new digital world, is there something that can help us stay in touch and make it 
easy to share our experiences with friends and family? There is, and it’s called Facebook. 
Facebook has become a phenomenal success since its startup in 2004. It’s 100% SaaS, 
so you don’t need to install any software on your computer, and it’s completely free to use. 
You’re going to love it.
What Is Facebook?
Facebook can be hard to describe. It’s part personal web site, mixed with a bit of e-mail and 
messaging type services. It has some video and photo hosting thrown in, some world-class 
search features for hunting down old schoolmates and friends, and it lets you post as much 
contact information as you care to share—phone numbers, addresses, and so on. Facebook 
does all this while letting you have total control over who can view your information. 
Your Facebook page and all its features are available from within your web browser. There 
is no software to install, and you can access your Facebook account from any computer that 
has Internet access. This means that you can upload pictures (and video) from your vacation 
for your family to view—while you’re still on vacation! And there’s no need to e-mail everyone 
your new mobile phone number. You can just post your new number on your Facebook page, 
and all your friends and family will be notified (assuming they have Facebook accounts).
Facebook isn’t a replacement for your e-mail or your personal web page. It’s just another 
tool that can make your life a little easier and less hectic when it comes to keeping your friends 
and family informed and involved.

Where Can I Find Facebook?
To get started with Facebook, you need to sign up and create an account. Here are the steps:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*b]_a^kkg*_ki. You’ll be prompted to sign up, as shown in Figure 16-1. 
Fill in the basic information, and then click the Sign Up button.
Figure 16-1. Register for Facebook by providing some basic information.
 
2. Next, you’ll need to type in the words shown in a graphic, similar to what you see in 
Figure 16-2. Then click the Sign Up button. You’ll be informed that an e-mail message 
has been sent to you. 
 
3. Check your e-mail and click the link provided in the message to confirm your account. 
You will be taken to a web page where you can log in using your e-mail address and 
password, as shown in Figure 16-3.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
285
Figure 16-2. Facebook requires you to prove you’re human by typing in the words you see 
on the screen.
Figure 16-3. Log in to Facebook with your e-mail address and password.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
286
 
4. Facebook will allow you to search for friends (Step 1 of 3), but I’m going to ask you to 
skip that step for now by clicking the Skip link. (I’ll show you how to do a friend search 
later in the chapter, in the “Find People You Know” section.) 
 
5. In Step 2 of 3, you can enter information about any schools you have attended, as well 
as your current employer. Facebook will attempt to find your schools as you enter their 
names (and provide you with lists to select from if your school name isn’t unique), as 
shown in Figure 16-4. Click the Save button to continue.
Figure 16-4. Enter information about your schools and employer.
 
6. Step 2 of 3 continues, and this is where it gets interesting. Facebook will take informa-
tion about the schools you attended (and the graduation year) and your employer, 
and show you other Facebook users who you might know, as shown in Figure 16-5. 
Take the time to scroll through the list. Here, you may find some old school friends or 
coworkers who also have Facebook pages. Clicking a name selects that person (note 
the check mark on the picture) to be contacted. Each person selected will be sent a 
message indicating that you wish to “friend” them. In this context, friend is a Facebook 
term that indicates a relationship (friend, family, coworker, or other) exists between 
two Facebook users. The person contacted can accept your invitation or ignore it. After 
making your selections, click the Add as Friends button to continue.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
287
 
7. Step 3 of 3 allows you to specify your physical location. Some towns and cities have 
their own Facebook group that contains users who live there. If this is true for your 
location, you can click the Join button to join the group or click the Skip button to 
ignore this option. I recommend skipping it for now. You can always join a town or city 
group later, after you’re more familiar with Facebook.
Figure 16-5. Facebook will find other users who you may know.
And now you’re ready to start using Facebook. You begin with a fairly sparse page, as 
shown in Figure 16-6, but don’t worry. It’s easy to use, and you’ll start seeing progress on your 
page quickly. Keep reading to learn more.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
288
Figure 16-6. Facebook starts you off with a blank slate, but that will change soon.
How Do I Use Facebook?
Facebook has more features than you can imagine. You can spend hours and hours exploring 
and finding new tools, toys, and games to add to your Facebook page. As you become more 
familiar with Facebook, you’ll begin to customize your page and make it more useful to you 
and your visitors.
Right now, your page is empty, and you have no friends (well, no Facebook friends). You 
might have selected some friends during your Facebook setup, but until they get the mes-
sage and accept your invitation, or you get an invitation from someone else, your Friends list 
is blank. This is a great time to start customizing your page (sort of like cleaning your house 
before you have guests). So let’s do some simple housekeeping and get the page ready for 
visitors.
Edit Your Profile
One of the first tasks you should do is to add more details to your profile. You can include 
items such as your hobbies, contact information, and even a place to tell the world what you’re 
doing right this very minute. Click the “View and edit your profile” link. You’ll see a page simi-
lar to the one shown in Figure 16-7.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
289
Figure 16-7. Your new Facebook profile is ready for news, pictures, and more.
Let’s start at the top. The first thing you want to do is let your Facebook friends know 
what you’re doing. Click the text that says “What are you doing right now?” (underneath your 
name), enter a description, and press the Enter key. Figure 16-8 shows a description I added 
to my profile. Anytime you want to update the description, just click the old one and type in a 
new one.
Figure 16-8. Facebook lets you provide a description of your current mood or activity.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
290
Next, skip down to the Information section and click the “Fill out your Profile” link. You’ll 
be taken to a page similar to the one shown in Figure 16-9. Here, you can enter what you like in 
the different tabs: Basic, Contact, Relationships, Personal, Education, Work, and Picture. Take 
the time to visit each tab and provide whatever information you feel comfortable sharing with 
those Facebook users who will have access to your page. Be sure to click the Save Changes but-
ton before you move to a different tab.
Figure 16-9. Enter more detailed information about yourself on each tab of your profile.
When you’re finished, click the Profile tab at the top of the screen to view your updated 
Facebook page. Figure 16-10 shows my profile so far. To make additions or changes, click the 
edit link to the right of the Profile tab.
I’ll show you how to add and find friends in the next section, but first, let’s look at one 
other basic task: using the Wall. 

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
291
Figure 16-10. View your updated Facebook page by clicking the Profile tab.
Use the Wall
The Wall is found on every Facebook user’s page and is a way to leave messages for that user 
and the user’s friends who can also see that page. Users can respond to one another’s Wall 
postings.
Because I haven’t added any friends yet, I’ll need to be the one to put some text on my 
Wall. To add text to your Wall, click the “Write on your own Wall” link. In the text box that 
appears, enter some text, and click the Post button. Figure 16-11 shows the Wall.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
292
Figure 16-11. Use the Wall feature to leave comments and greetings to your friends.
NNote Facebook really has changed my life. During September 2008, I logged in to my personal Facebook 
page and was greeted with messages alerting me that I had two friend requests waiting. I clicked the link 
and was pleasantly surprised to find two of my old college friends, Howard and Janell. Howard had just 
joined Facebook and had located me using the school search. Janell had been a Facebook user for a while, 
but she had a new last name, which kept me from tracking her down. I had been looking for these two 
friends for some time, and Facebook allowed us to find one another, catch up on news (Janell has twins!), 
and make sure we don’t lose touch again. I love Facebook!
More Facebook Details
Here, I’ll show you a couple activities that you can do using Facebook that will increase your 
enjoyment of the service. The first involves using Facebook’s powerful search capabilities to 
hunt down people such as long-lost friends and former work colleagues. The second activity 
is adding “mini-applications” to your Facebook page for your friends to view and enjoy. Some 
of these applications are games, some are organization tools, and others are hard to classify. 
After that, it’s up to you to explore Facebook on your own. I guarantee that you’ll find many 
fun and useful things to add to your Facebook page.
Find People You Know
You can find just those people who have a Facebook account. This is not as limiting as it may 
sound, because Facebook is growing by thousands of users every day. So, the odds are good 
that you’ll locate some of your old contacts. 
Let’s go find an old friend or two. 

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
293
 
1. Click the “Search for friends” link on your Facebook home page. This link is under the 
Friends box on the left side of the page (see Figure 16-10). You’ll see a page like the one 
shown in Figure 16-12.
Figure 16-12. The Search tool will let you hunt for old or current acquaintances.
 
2. You could just enter the person’s name in the Search for box and click the Search 
button, but you would likely end up with dozens (or even hundreds) of matches. Fig-
ure 16-13 shows what happened when I searched for David Thompson: more than 
500 matches! Consider using other search terms, such as city/state, company name, 
and even birthday, to narrow down you search. You can also try the Classmates and 
Coworkers search options. Click either of these, and you’ll see a few more fields that 
can be used to narrow down the search results.
 
3. Once you locate an existing Facebook user who you think you know, it’s time to make 
contact (you cannot simply add them as a friend yet). Click either the Add as Friend 
link or the Send a Message link, as shown in Figure 16-14. I recommend using the Add 
as Friend link, because it will allow you send a friend request and add a personal mes-
sage. The Send a Message link just lets you send a message, not a request to be friends.
 
4. Assuming you clicked Add as Friend, you can then click the “Add a personal message” 
link and type in a message. In Figure 16-15, I’ve added the message, “Is this the David 
Thompson who attended FSU in the early 1990s?” After you’ve entered your message, 
click the Add Friend button.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
294
Figure 16-13. Unless the name is unique, a basic search will not be that useful.
Figure 16-14. Locate a Facebook user and make contact.
Figure 16-15. Send a friend request and wait to see if the person accepts.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
295
The next time this person logs in to Facebook, he will see your friend request. At that 
point, he can accept, decline, or send a reply message asking for additional information. If he 
does accept your invitation, you’ll see a new friend notice the next time you log in to Facebook. 
This will let you view that person’s Facebook page, e-mail him, and view all the information on 
his page that he has provided for viewing by friends.
Sometimes you’ll be lucky enough that a friend or coworker will tell you her Facebook 
username and initiate the friend request. At other times, you’ll need to do some searching for 
that needle-in-a-haystack friend. But in the end, the time spent locating new and old acquain-
tances is well worth the effort.
NTip While you’re doing a search for friends, you can search for organizations, too. Do a search for that 
magazine that you subscribe to, that shoe company whose best product is on your feet, and even your favor-
ite book publisher. Yes, Apress has a Facebook page where you can learn about its new book releases, and 
even post comments and questions. I’ve been assured that Apress just loves hearing from its fans, and will 
add you as a friend if you send a request!
Add an Application
Facebook has its own free applications! These are little bits of software that Facebook or other 
software developers have created that “latch on” to the Facebook user interface and are avail-
able to you and anyone else who views your profile. Here, I’ll show you how to find Facebook 
applications and add them to your page. (These applications also have their own special loca-
tion on a Facebook profile, so don’t be surprised that you can’t move them around to various 
locations.)
As you can see listed under Applications on your home page, Facebook gives you some 
starter applications, such as Photos, Video, Group, and Events. To add a new application, fol-
low these steps:
 
1. Click the edit link to the right of the Applications list (see Figure 16-10). 
 
2. On the new page, click the “Browse more applications” button, and you’ll see a page 
similar to the one shown in Figure 16-16.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
296
Figure 16-16. Find new applications to add to your Facebook page.
 
3. Don’t let the long list of applications overwhelm you. Use the subject links listed along 
the right side of the Application Directory page to narrow down your search. For exam-
ple, I clicked the Travel subject and found two travel-related applications, as shown in 
Figure 16-17. 

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
297
Figure 16-17. Use the subject list to narrow down your search for Facebook applications.
 
4. When you’ve found an interesting-looking application, click its name to see a page 
with a little more information about the application and how it works. For example, I 
thought it might be fun to show my friends all the places I’ve visited, so I clicked the 
Where I’ve Been application and was presented with the page shown in Figure 16-18.
 
5. If you decide that you want to add the application, click the Add Application button, 
and accept the settings that pop up.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
298
Figure 16-18. Add the application to your Facebook page.
After the application is installed, you can view it on your Facebook page. Figure 16-19 
shows the new Where I’ve Been application added to my Facebook page.

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING
299
Figure 16-19. The new application appears on your Facebook page.
You can add and delete applications anytime you like. Spend some time browsing through 
the available applications, and you’re sure to find one or more that would look great on your 
Facebook page, and give your friends something more to learn about you.
Investigate Further
Two other services that are similar to Facebook might be of interest to you. They have slightly 
different goals, as described here:
s MySpace (dppl6++sss*iuol]_a*_ki): MySpace started out as a free service for musicians 
and bands to provide information to their fans about concerts, downloads of music 
samples, pictures, and interviews. Today, it’s popular with just about every type of 
user, not just musicians. On MySpace, you can share pictures, news, and more. 
s LinkedIn (dppl6++sss*hejga`ej*_ki): Think of LinkedIn as a Facebook for business 
networking. This free service lets its users stay in touch with coworkers, search for ser-
vices that they require, and form networking groups for purposes of growing sales and 
identifying sales leads. 

CHAPTER 16 N  SOCIAL NETWORKING

Summary
Facebook is one of my favorite (and free!) services on the Internet. I’ve been able to keep in 
touch with friends back in Texas, locate old college buddies, and track down coworkers from 
previous jobs. I’m able to upload pictures and video that my family and friends can view and 
comment on. I use an application that lets me track my participation in the Kiva.org nonprofit 
company. And I love to add comments to my friends’ pictures and let them know I’m staying 
up-to-date with them. 
As long as I maintain my Facebook page, I can rest assured that there is an online tool 
available that will let others locate me and get in touch, no matter where I live or work. Give 
Facebook a try, and see if you agree.

Group Scheduling
If you’ve ever tried to schedule a party, night out at the movies, or other event involving more 
than two people, you know how difficult it can be to find a date and time that is convenient for 
everyone. The typical method involves a lot of phone calls or e-mail messages (or both), plus 
at least one negotiation with that “difficult” friend. And if your group is going to see a movie, 
there’s the next problem of which movie to see! Typically, some time during the process, you 
just want to throw up your hands and cancel the entire thing. 
Group scheduling will always be tricky, but fortunately. there’s a free online service that 
will help remove some of the hassles, and allow you to pick the date and time that works best 
for the most people. It’s called Doodle. Once you try it, you’ll be hooked. Doodle is one of 
those “killer apps” that not only does what it’s supposed to do, but also gives you new abilities 
and new patterns of organization that make your life better. 
What Is Doodle?
Doodle is a simple and free service that allows you to turn any event (such as a birthday party) 
or a choice (such as between movie A and movie B) into an online poll. This is what pundits 
like to call a paradigmatic change—it’s a different way of thinking about a social event. We’re 
used to thinking about an event as something that one person determines and invites other 
people to join. Doodle changes that pattern. It makes event timing collectively determined by 
you and the people you invite.
With Doodle, you create the poll and select the options (months, days, and times, for 
example) from which your invitees must choose. You will be sent an e-mail message with the 
URL (web site address) for this poll.
Next, you e-mail the poll’s URL link to all participants. Invitees click the link to go to a 
page where they can select the dates and times that work best for an event or make a choice 
from multiple options.
You are also e-mailed a private URL that takes you to a page where you can modify 
your poll and check the results. Doodle tracks the responses and provides you with a sum-
mary of the feedback, including the “winning” date/time (the one that has the most positive 
responses). 
Doodle is particularly well suited when you need to invite a large number of people to an 
event such as a meeting, and there are multiple potential dates for that event. The alterna-
tive is keeping a complicated spreadsheet with people’s preferred dates and sorting them into 
classes—a serious headache. With a Doodle poll, people will automatically sort themselves 
into the right dates. All you need to do is sit back and watch the responses roll in. 
301

CHAPTER 17 N  GROUP SCHEDULING
302
For large groups, it will be almost impossible to get one day and one time that works for 
everyone. Doodle lets you see which days and times have the largest number of available 
participants. And Doodle’s ability to let you provide choices for participants to vote on is 
great, too.
Where Can I Find Doodle?
Doodle falls under the SaaS category, so there’s no software to install. And it’s such a simple 
little application that it’s perfectly suited for using with your web browser. Follow these steps 
to begin using Doodle:
 
1. Visit dppl6++sss*`kk`ha*_d+.
 
2. You can click the Create account link and create an account (free), or click the Schedule 
event button or Make choice button to create your Doodle poll immediately. Creating 
an account allows you to more easily manage all your polls, but is not required.
How Do I Use Doodle?
You can create either a schedule-based poll or a choice-based poll by clicking the correspond-
ing button on Doodle’s home page (dppl6++sss*`kk`ha*_d+). Here, I’ll walk through setting up 
a schedule-based poll. The process for creating a choice-based poll (the Make choice button) 
is similar.
 
1. Click the Schedule event button on Doodle’s home page. You’ll be presented with Step 
1 of 3 for creating your poll.
 
2. Enter a title for your poll, as well as a simple description. This description will be help-
ful to your invitees when they visit the site to make their date and time selections. 
You’ll also need to provide your name and e-mail address. In Figure 17-1, I’m creating 
a birthday party poll. Click Next to continue. 
NCaution Remember that your recipients will be getting the poll announcement as an e-mail message. 
You can spare yourself potential embarrassment by double-checking your description before it goes “live” in 
front of all your friends.

CHAPTER 17 N  GROUP SCHEDULING
303
Figure 17-1. Create your first Doodle poll by providing some basic information.
 
3. In Step 2 of 3, you select the possible dates for the event. You can click the << and >> 
buttons to change the possible months for your event. For a particular month, click the 
days you wish to make available in your poll. When a day is selected, it will turn green. 
(Click the day again to deselect it, and it will turn dark gray.) In Figure 17-2, I have 
selected May 16, 17, 23, and 24 as possible days for the birthday party. As you select 
multiple days, those dates will be listed to the right of the calendar. You move forward 
and backward in the calendar to select dates in other months. Once you’ve selected all 
the possible days for your poll, click Next.

304
Figure 17-2. Select the possible months and days for your event.
 
4. In Step 3 of 3, you select possible times for your event. For each date that you selected, 
you can provide up to five possible times. If you need additional time slots, click the 
“Add further time slots” link. Enter your times (use am or pm to specify morning or 
afternoon times) in the boxes. You may also click the “Copy and paste first row” link, 
and the times entered for your first date will be duplicated in all subsequent dates. Fig-
ure 17-3 shows the time slots I’ve entered for the birthday party.
 
5. To complete your poll, click the Finish button. The Options button will let you make 
your poll results private, so only you can see them (although, generally, you will want 
to let your invitees see the final poll results after they provide their poll responses), and 
limit the number of responses from each recipient. The next page will request that you 
check your e-mail. 
You should receive two e-mail messages: one with the poll link to send to invitees and 
another with a link to manage your poll. Figure 17-4 shows an example of the message you will 
receive to send to invitees.

date/time selections to the poll.
NTip Don’t forget to include yourself in the Doodle vote!

reminding) your invitees to use the service, all of which will be covered next.

More Doodle Details
Your Doodle poll won’t be very helpful if your invitees don’t use it. Before you forward the 
e-mail containing the poll link to an invitee, consider adding more details about your event, as 
well as instructions for using the Doodle poll. When using Doodle, I’ve found it helpful to tell 
invitees that they will not need to register to use the service and that the event options are easy 
to view and select. 
NTip It never hurts to mention in your e-mail message to invitees that the event’s final date and time will 
be selected by those who actually participate in the poll. You will be able to see the names of those who 
participate, allowing you to ignore the complaints from those who don’t like the final date and time, but 
didn’t vote.
When invitees receive the e-mail message and click the link, they will be taken to a page 
that looks similar to Figure 17-7, where they can make their selections.
Figure 17-7. After clicking the link in the e-mail message, invitees are taken to a page like this to 
choose dates and times.

CHAPTER 17 N  GROUP SCHEDULING

From this page, an invitee can see how many other invitees have participated in the poll, 
as well as their selections. The most popular date and time are also shown.
For an invitee to participate, he simply replaces “Your name” in the text box with his 
own name, and selects one or more of the date and time options, as shown in the example in 
Figure 17-8. Finally, he clicks the Save button to submit his selections.
Figure 17-8. Invitees enter their name and choose dates and times.
Invitees can make changes to their selections at any time by revisiting the poll and click-
ing the Edit an entry link, as shown in Figure 17-9. Clicking the Delete an entry link removes 
their choices from the poll. Invitees can also leave comments by clicking the Add a comment 
link. Additional functions allow invitees to print the poll (click the Print link) and create a PDF 
or spreadsheet file (click the File export link).
Figure 17-9. Invitees can edit their selections at any time.
As mentioned earlier, you can also create a choice-based poll with Doodle. Clicking the 
Make choice button on the Doodle home page lets you create a poll that allows participants to 
select from up to ten options you designate, rather than choose a month, day, and time. This is 
perfect for groups trying to pick a movie or a restaurant, for example.

Investigate Further
If Doodle is useful to you, you might be interested in these similar services:
s Imagination Cubed (dppl6++sss*ei]cej]pekj_q^a`*_ki+ej`at*ldl): General Electric 
offers a free collaboration whiteboard. You can grab the virtual marker pen and get cre-
ative, and invite others to do the same.
s TimeToMeet (dppl6++sss*peiapkiaap*ejbk+): TimeToMeet offers a service similar to 
Doodle’s, but also integrates with Outlook Calendar, Google, and iCal calendars. It 
allows you and work colleagues to find suitable meeting dates and times.
Summary
Doodle fundamentally remakes scheduling. It eliminates centralized tracking and assigning, 
worrying about people’s schedules, and keeping track of their special requests. With Doodle, 
you will be sent an e-mail message each time an invitee completes the poll. You can visit the 
poll at any time to view the most popular date and time that works best for the largest group 
of invitees.
Don’t let Doodle’s simplicity fool you. This service can be extremely useful for any event, 
but it truly shines when you have a long list of invitees and can be flexible on the date and 
time, or have multiple meetings that your invitees can attend. The time you’ll save by not hav-
ing to make phone calls and handle the individual, back-and-forth e-mail can be put to use 
planning your event.

Appendix 
I wanted to include many more free applications in this book, but time and a reasonable book 
length were always working against me. Rather than cut them out completely, I’ve listed some 
of my favorites in this appendix. You’ll find short descriptions of each, along with the location 
where you can download the software or enter in your web browser to access Software as a 
Service (SaaS) applications.
Get Friendly Reminders
Google Calendar (see Chapter 6) can e-mail you reminders, as well as send text messages to 
your mobile phone so you never miss an appointment, birthday, or other important event. 
But if you’re not a Google Calendar user, take a look at Remindr, a free web-based service that 
allows you to send a short description to your mobile phone, e-mail, and a few other services. 
It’s completely free to use and requires no registration. Check it out at dppl6++naiej`n*ejbk+.
Protect Your E-Mail Address
If you frequently visit online stores and other web sites that require you to provide your e-mail 
address, you probably worry about that address falling into the wrong hands and being used to 
send you spam e-mail. Melt Mail is a nice solution.
Melt Mail is 100% free to use and completely confidential. Just visit dppl6++iahpi]eh*_ki+ 
and click Create. Enter your real e-mail address in the text field, and select how long Melt Mail 
will keep your e-mail address on record (3, 6, 12, or 24 hours). You’ll be given a temporary 
iahpi]eh*_ki address that you can provide to web sites that ask for your e-mail address. Any 
e-mail messages sent to this iahpi]eh*_ki address during the time period you specify will be 
forwarded to your real e-mail address. When the time expires, Melt Mail purges your e-mail 
address from its database, and you won’t receive any more e-mail sent to the temporary 
iahpi]eh*_ki address you were assigned.
Brainstorm Online
How many ideas have been drawn on a napkin during a lunch or dinner meeting? Have you 
ever wished you could brainstorm with someone over the phone or over the Internet, and 
somehow share a drawing board or piece of paper when writing, drawing, or trying to explain 
something? If so, take a look at Dabbleboard by visiting dppl6++sss*`]^^ha^k]n`*_ki+. 
Dabbleboard allows you to collaborate with friends, business colleagues, and others using 
a shared drawing space. You can print whatever you create when you’re finished. Your work is 
totally secure, and will be shared only if you choose to do so. And, even better, Dabbleboard is 
free to use.

Find Lost Items
I left my mobile phone sitting on a stool at a restaurant about a year ago. Later that night, I got 
a call on my home phone from someone who had found it, read the “Please call” information 
stored in the phone, and tracked me down to return my phone. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could 
somehow tag all of our valuable items that might be lost, giving the finder the ability to track 
us down? Well, the nice people at SendMeHome have created an online service that can help.
SendMeHome lets you generate a code (a SendMeHome ID) for any items you wish to 
tag. You can write this code on the item or print out a label generated by the web site, and 
affix that label on the item. The labels say “If lost, please return using sendmehome.com” 
and also include the SendMeHome ID. If someone finds your tagged item, he simply goes to 
dppl6++sss*oaj`iadkia*_ki+ and enters the ID. You will receive an e-mail from SendMeHome, 
and the service will help arrange for communication between you and the finder. 
SendMeHome is free to use, and it will never sell your information to any other organiza-
tions. The only costs you may incur are shipping charges or other costs to retrieve your item 
from the finder. Visit dppl6++sss*oaj`iadkia*_ki to register and use this service.
Selective Web Page Printing
If you’ve ever wanted to print a web page but wished you could skip advertisements or large 
graphics on the page, you’ll be happy to learn about PrintWhatYouLike. 
To use this free service, simply visit dppl6++sss*lnejpsd]pukqhega*_ki, enter the web site 
address (URL), and click the Start button. Click any element on the web page that you don’t 
want to print (such as a photo, link, or advertisement) and click the Remove button on the 
toolbar along the left side of the screen. You can also increase or decrease the font size, as well 
as remove a colored or textured background. Finally, click the Save as button, and save the 
edited file as a PDF or HTML document that will be saved to your computer for printing.
Send Musical Online Postcards
If you have a photo that you would like to share with someone, you can turn it into a complete 
package by adding some music and a personal message using Postcard.fm’s free service. 
Visit dppl6++sss*lkop_]n`*bi to begin. Browse for your photo, browse for a song in MP3 
format, and then enter the recipient’s e-mail address. You’ll be given a chance to preview your 
postcard and listen to the music. Add a personal note to complete the card, and then click the 
Send button. Postcard.fm will deliver an e-mail with a link for the recipient to click to view the 
image, hear the music, and read your note.
Design a Room
If you’ve ever coveted that special software interior decorators use to create eye-catching 
room designs, you’re going to love PlanningWiz. Before a single piece of furniture is pur-
chased or placed, you can use this online application to model a room’s dimensions and 
size, and then place furniture, rugs, and other items around the room. The application will 
even let you lay out multiple rooms, or an entire house or office space. Items ranging from 
TVs to table-tennis tables can be dropped into your floor plan, and you can drag, resize, and 

NAPPENDIX 
313
rotate them as desired. You can even save and print your designs (in full color if you have a 
color printer). Try it out at dppl6++r/*lh]jjejcsev*_ki+.
Ship and Track Packages
If you ship and track packages routinely, you’ll want to check out ShipTool. Instead of need-
ing to visit each shipper’s web site individually (UPS, FedEx, DHL, and the US Postal Service), 
you can visit dppl6++sss*odelpkkh*_ki and track all your packages from one place. Even better 
is the ability to get a cost estimate for shipping a package from each carrier. You provide the 
weight, dimensions, delivery date required, and source and destination addresses. ShipTool 
then gives you estimates from all four shipping companies.
Create a Web Site
Chapter 15 describes how easy it is to create your own blog. But if you have a desire to cre-
ate your own web site, then you really need to check out the web design application called 
Trellian WebPage. It’s a true “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) application. You 
can create your own links, add pictures and video, tweak fonts and colors, and even dig 
deep into the actual HTML code, if you’re so inclined. Download the free application from 
dppl6++sss*pnahhe]j*_ki+sa^l]ca+ and start designing your own web site.
Hard Drive Imaging
Chapter 10 covers applications for backing up your data files, but there’s another type of insur-
ance you can obtain to protect your entire hard drive. It’s called a hard drive image. This is a 
virtual photograph of your hard drive, which you can copy to a CD, DVD, or even another hard 
drive. If at some point in the future your hard drive should fail or catch a nasty virus, you can 
overwrite the entire hard drive with the image you created. It’s like starting from scratch, but 
doesn’t require you to reinstall the operating system or applications.
To create your hard drive image, you can use the 100% free application called Macrium 
Reflect, available for download at dppl6++sss*i]_neqi*_ki+Nabha_pBnaa*]ol. The built-in help 
tells you how to use it.
Child-Safe Web Browsing
Many web sites out there are simply unsafe for kids. Most parents can’t sit beside their 
children at the computer constantly and monitor the sites they’re visiting. Thankfully, applica-
tions such as K9 Web Protection provide a way for parents to lock out inappropriate content. 
Like an antivirus application that downloads and installs regular updates, K9 Web Protection 
uses a similar technology that updates its database of dangerous web sites. And it’s password-
protected for those budding little computer experts who might try to disable the protection. 
You can download this application from dppl6++sss-*g5sa^lnkpa_pekj*_ki+.
