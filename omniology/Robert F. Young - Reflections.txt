REFLECTIONS
ROBERT F. YOUNG
 
WE ARE sojourning on Earth, 
           Berenice and I, on the littoral 
      of one of the fresh-water lakes that 
have recently reappeared on the
       north continents, we
sleep late mornings and loll
through long afternoons; evenings
we dip into a perma-chest of an-
-cient writings unearthed by visitors 
   like ourselves and left behind. The
chest contains numerous and di--
   verse examples of this lost art—
     probably they were gathered to--
       gether by some dedicated eccentric
who had no better purpose in life. 
    Some of them are unique indeed 
and have to do with the future as 
        some of the more literate elements
of the then society foresaw it, at
that time the earth was
 
green, not as green perhaps as
it once had been but green enough
—they had a complex about this
greenness, these writers did, they 
knew, or thought they knew, that 
some day it would be gone and 
this worried them immensely. 
They wrote endlessly of how green 
the earth was and how blue were
her skies and carped constantly at
their contemporaries for defiling
the one and
   polluting the other—they wrote 
about space, too. Space and space--
ships, spaceships built of dreams
and metal—they thought, you see, 
that travel to the stars would be 
accomplished by means similar to 
those employed to reach the moon. 
Oh, such ships they wrote about, 
these little literary men! Elongated
 
leviathans carrying whole popu

lations to the stars (usually after
Earth gave up the ghost), tons and 
tons and tons of steel plying the 
immensities—they
   wrote about aliens, too—aliens
from "Alpha Centauri III" and
"Far Procyon IV" and, unavoid
ably, they wrote about us. It's fun
to read what someone who died
millennia before you were born
thought you were going to look 
like and how he thought you were 
going to think, although it's an-
-noying also, because these writers 
lived during an age sickened by 
sex (among other things), and they 
could not see human relationships 
in their proper perspective; hence
their future travelers were little 
more than spaceborne troglodytes 
carrying cudgels in the shape of 
ray guns and dragging four-
wheeled carts behind them—carts 
filled with misdeeds, misconcep--
tions and mistakes. But, for all 
their apprehensions,
Earth is still a lovely place to 
be, especially now in spring—and
it is still green ... I wonder what
these writers would think to see me
sitting here with my true love Ber
enice, reading what they wrote so
long ago. They would not be able,
though, to see us as we really are 
but only as reflections. The hu--
man race has changed incalculably 
since they walked upon the earth 
and we are vastly different from 
them. But they were vastly differ--
ent, too—were they not?—from
 
the apes who preceded them and
who could not write at all, so our
being the way we are should not
surprise them overmuch. Never
theless, it would, and our reading
what they wrote would surprise
them even more and perhaps em
barrass them. I
turn to Berenice, I say, "Why
did they write about the future

when they could not even under
stand the present?" She answers, 
"That is why—because they 
couldn't understand. If they had 
tried—perhaps they could have 
penetrated the suffocating fog of 
self-importance that lay thickly 
over their land and have glimpsed
 
 
part of the truth." "Perhaps
you are right," I agree. "But I 
doubt that very many of their con-
-temporaries read what they wrote, 
so their insight wouldn't have done
the world much good." "Probab-
-ly,” 
Berenice remarks, "they
wouldn't have recognized the truth 
even if they had glimpsed it. They
lived in an age that History later
referred to as the Age of Hypoc
risy and in an age of hypocrisy
there can be no truths—only ma
jority opinions—and these can be
bought by men rich and clever 
enough and
  even the hardiest of seekers af--
ter truth are invariably led astray, 
and these were not the
hardiest."
  Nor were they being honest—
that which you cannot find in your 
own today you will never find in
someone else's tomorrow. "Sol"
they called the sun            and Earth,
"Sol III." How quaint. Sol or sun
—its rays are warm upon us now,
although this is immaterial to our
comfort, for our bodies are inde
pendent of temperature; but Sol/
sun's rays are warm upon us just
the same as we loll on the shore of
our blue lake, soon, though, Sol/ 
sun will set and the darkness of 
Earthnight will creep like death 
across the land, though death to 
us, of course, is no longer a valid 
concept, even though it will come 
to us some day. But it will not 
come darkly or disdainfully as it

came to our ancestors—the way 
the Earthnight will shortly come 
when Sol/sun has set—I would 
not have wanted to live in those 
dim days.
Our interest is not confined sole--
ly to those writers in the collec--
tion who wrote about tomorrow—
we are also reading those who
wrote about the times in which
they lived. Some of them wrote
very well—they reflected their so
ciety and if this be a criterion of
good writing the Age of Hypocrisy
was not lacking in this respect, nor
were the ages which preceded it. 
There was one writer in particular 
who reflected his time exceedingly 
well—he was like a mirror held up 
to the world and the glass was 
tinted in some magic fashion so 
that the world was reflected with 
poignant overtones that linger on
long after you have read what he
 
wrote—it is writers like him we
read when we would know about
the past, the
future we already know about
because we live in it—but it is in--
triguing nevertheless to read what 
those other writers thought it 
would be like, thought space travel
would be like. The
days pass swiftly here and Ber--
enice and I have so much living to 
do. I say living, although it is not 
really that, not in the sense it once 
was understood—that kind of liv-
-ing was a fretwork of contrasts, of 
play and work, of pleasure and
 
pain, of feast and famine, all over-
-shadowed by the imminence of 
death. No, that is not the sort of 
living I refer to as I sit here in the
Earthdusk, letting my mind roam
free, our kind of living would have 
been incomprehensible to the hu-
-man race before it attained ma-
-turity. I say

"maturity" when what I really 
should say is "present stage of de--
velopment—" for I, like all hu
mans before me, am afflicted with
the smug conviction that the age in
which I live is the culmination of
all the ages that preceded it (this
is the truth Berenice referred to so 
short a time ago). I suspect that
those malefactors of ancient 
days who were beheaded for their 
crimes believed even as the axe 
descended upon their naked necks
that theirs was the best of all pos
sible worlds. I
wouldn't be surprised--indeed,
I know this to be the case from
reading what they wrote—that
the poor souls living in the Age
of Hypocrisy (for all they may
have said to the contrary) be
lieved ardently even while they
sank ever deeper into the mire
of deceits, lies and self-decep
tions they had created for them
selves that all that had gone be
fore them had paved the way for 
them—truly,
man is a prisoner of his times, 
incapable not only of seeing what 
his prison looks like from with-
-out but of discerning what it is 
really like within.
 
Now the night that is like dis--
dainful death is upon us, and 
Berenice and I withdraw beneath 
the canopy of boughs we have
fashioned for nostalgia's sake and
light a small fire at our feet, not 
to keep us warm but to keep the 
past at bay. Beyond its little 
flames the darkness gathers in—
beyond the darkness burn the 
stars—soon we shall be back 
among them, Berenice and I,
where we belong, we
can remain upon, a planet only
for a little length of time, which
makes us wonder why those writ
ers of so long ago arbitrarily con--

cluded that life that originated 
in the sea would consummate its 
evolution on the land—that land 
was a final, rather than a second-
-dary, step—even when they put
us\in space they made us carry
part of the land with us in those
 
ponderous phallic ships that they
invented. I
tend, though, to be hypocritical
in my evaluation of my ancestors,
though no more so, probably, than
they were in their evaluation of
theirs. Theirs climbed into trees,
they climbed down from them, we
climbed into
heaven, Homo sapiens was not
destined to live forever like an 
ape, nor Homo astralis like a 
man, no
one dwells upon the Earth now. 
It is no more than a resort which 
we indifferently maintain—a
 
park to which some of us return 
at sporadic intervals to reflect 
upon what we are and what we 
were, it is a big green picnic table 
hanging in space, one of many 
others like it, some of which are 
inhabited by apes. Berenice and
I are sitting at the big Earth Ta-
-ble now, others have sat here be--
fore us, others will sit after—the
fire flickers, I add more wood,
 
the stars recede. I would like to 
be a mirror so that I, too, might 
reflect my times—we are far
 
 
more than star-travelers. We are 
a part of the stars and yet the
 
mirror would show only empti--
ness, the emptiness of space, for
alas, I am no Scott Fitzgerald. I 
can only touch a truth here and 
there and then only in my
thoughts and I am not sure, per

haps the biggest truth of all 
eludes me still. Certainly it can--
not be as simple as that we are
 
the ultimate purpose of life. I 
think I see it sometimes, though, 
hiding in the lines of my true
 
love's face as she sleeps beside
 
me in the night, iridescing in the 
 
distant sheen of her hair. But in
 
the morning it will be gone, and
 
in a little while we will be gone, too, and the truth will have vanished in the night.
