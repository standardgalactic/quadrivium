About the Author
Tony Bove is crazy about iPods, iPhones, and iTunes: He not only provides 
free tips on his Web site (www.tonybove.com), but also took the plunge to 
develop an iPhone application (Tony’s Tips for iPhone Users). Tony has writ-
ten more than two dozen books on computing, desktop publishing, and mul-
timedia, including iLife ’04 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Wiley), 
The GarageBand Book (Wiley), The Art of Desktop Publishing (Bantam), 
and a series of books about Macromedia Director, Adobe Illustrator, and 
PageMaker. Tony also founded Desktop Publishing/Publish magazine and the 
Inside Report on New Media newsletter, and he wrote the weekly Macintosh 
column for Computer Currents for a decade. Tracing the personal computer 
revolution back to the 1960s counterculture, Tony produced a CD-ROM inter-
active documentary in 1996, Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties (featuring music 
from the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane). He also devel-
oped the Rockument music site, www.rockument.com, with commentary 
and podcasts focused on rock music history. As a founding member of the 
Flying Other Brothers (www.flyingotherbros.com), which toured profes-
sionally and released three commercial CDs (52-Week High, San Francisco 
Sounds, and Estimated Charges), Tony performed with Hall of Fame rock musi-
cians. Tony has also worked as a director of enterprise marketing for leading-
edge software companies, and as a communications director and technical 
publications manager.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my sons, nieces, nephews, their cousins, and all 
their children . . . the iPod generation.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank Jimi Eric Bove for providing technical expertise and per-
forming valuable testing on his iPod touch, and John Paul Bove for iTunes, 
Windows, and iPhone expertise. I also want to thank Rich Tennant for his 
wonderful cartoons, and Dennis Cohen for technical expertise beyond the 
call of duty. And let me not forget my Wiley editors, Paul Levesque and 
Virginia Sanders, for ongoing assistance that made my job so much easier. A 
book this timely places a considerable burden on a publisher’s production 
team, and I thank the production crew at Wiley for diligence beyond the call 
of reason.
I owe thanks and a happy hour or three to Carole McLendon at Waterside, 
my agent. And fi nally, I have executive editor Bob Woerner at Wiley to thank 
for coming up with the idea for this book and helping me to become a profes-
sional dummy — that is, a Dummies author.

Introduction
T
his is the part in which I’m supposed to introduce the iPod touch and tell 
you why I wrote this book, but frankly, I’m so blown away by the iPod 
touch and all it can do that all I want to do is get you started with it.
Yes, I have a history with iPods: I wrote iPod & iTunes For Dummies, which 
I recommend for studying iTunes more closely. iTunes is the free software 
that controls the iPod touch from your computer. I even wrote an application 
for the iPhone and iPod touch, called Tony’s Tips. But enough about that: 
Obviously I’m a true fan of the iPod line, and I think you should be too! So, on 
with the book!
About This Book
The publishers are wise about book matters, and they helped me design iPod 
touch For Dummies as a reference. With this book, you can easily find the 
information you need when you need it. I wrote it so that you can read from 
beginning to end to find out how to use your iPod touch from scratch. But 
this book is also organized so that you can dive in anywhere and begin read-
ing the info you need to know for each task.
I didn’t have enough pages to cover every detail of every function, and I 
intentionally left out some detail so that you won’t be befuddled with techno-
speak when it’s not necessary. I wrote brief but comprehensive descriptions 
and included lots of cool tips on how to get the most out of your iPod touch.
At the time I wrote this book, I covered the most recent iPod touch model 
and the latest version of iTunes. Although I did my best to keep up for this 
print edition, Apple occasionally slips in a new model or new version of 
iTunes between book editions. If you’ve bought a new iPod touch with fea-
tures not covered in the book, or if your version of iTunes looks a little dif-
ferent, be sure to check out the Tony’s Tips section of my Web site (www.
tonybove.com) for updates on the latest releases from Apple.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like any book that covers computers, mobile devices, and information tech-
nology, this book uses certain conventions:
 
✓ Choosing from a screen or menu: When I write “Choose Settings➪
General from the Home screen,” you tap Settings on the iPod touch 
Home screen and then tap General on the Settings screen.

2
iPod Touch For Dummies 
 
 With iTunes, when I write “Choose View➪Hide Browser,” it means you 
should click the View menu, move the cursor down to highlight the Hide 
Browser option, and click to select it.
 
✓ Sliding, scrolling, and flicking on an iPod touch: When you see “Slide 
the screen” or “Flick the screen,” I mean you need to use your finger to 
slide the screen. When I write “scroll the list on the iPod touch Settings 
screen,” I mean you should use your finger to slide the list so that it 
scrolls. 
 
✓ Clicking and dragging on the computer: When you see “Drag the song 
over the name of the playlist,” I mean you need to click the song name 
(in iTunes), hold the mouse button down, and then drag the song with 
the mouse over to the name of the playlist before lifting your finger off 
the mouse button.
 
✓ Keyboard shortcuts on the computer: When you see Ô-I, press the Ô 
key on a Mac keyboard along with the appropriate shortcut key. (In this 
case, press I, which opens the Song Information window in iTunes.) In 
Windows, the same keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-I (which means press the 
Ctrl key along with the I key). Don’t worry — I always tell you what the 
equivalent Windows keys are.
 
✓ Step lists: When you come across steps that you need to do in iTunes 
or on the iPod touch, the action is in bold, and the explanatory part fol-
lows. If you know what to do, read the action and skip the explanation. 
But if you need a little help along the way, check out the explanation.
 
✓ Pop-up menus: I use the term pop-up menu for menus on the Mac that 
literally pop up from dialogs and windows; in Windows, the same type 
of menu actually drops down and is called a drop-down menu. I use the 
term pop-up menu for both. 
A Quick Peek Ahead
This book is organized into six parts, and each part covers a different aspect 
of using your iPod or iPhone and iTunes. Here’s a quick preview of what you 
can find in each part.
Part I: Touching All the Basics
This part gets you started with your iPod touch: powering it up, recharging 
its battery, using its multi-touch interface and onscreen keyboard, and con-
necting it to your computer. You also find out all the techniques of an iPod 
touch road warrior: setting your alarm and multiple clocks for time zones,

 Introduction
keeping time with your stopwatch, changing your display settings, setting the 
passcode to lock up the device so others can’t use it, and setting restrictions 
on content and the use of applications.
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup
This part shows you how to download to your computer songs, albums, 
podcasts, audio books, movies, TV shows, and music videos from the iTunes 
Store, and applications from the App Store. You also find out how to buy 
music, podcasts, videos, and applications directly on your iPod touch. I also 
show you how to synchronize your iPod touch with your iTunes library on 
your computer, and with your personal contacts, e-mail accounts, Web book-
marks, and calendars. 
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest
In this part, I show you how to locate and play all types of content on your 
iPod touch — music, audio books, podcasts, movies, TV shows, videos, 
and slideshows of your own photos. You discover how to control playback, 
adjust the volume and equalize the sound, and play YouTube videos. 
Part IV: Touching the Online World
This part describes how to use your iPod touch and the Safari application to 
surf the Web. You also find out how to check and send e-mail, look at your 
stock portfolio, and check the weather in your city and other cities. I also 
show you how to display maps and driving directions. 
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date
In this part I explain how to use your iPod touch to locate and communicate 
with friends on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and other social networks and 
instantly chat with people. I also show you how to enter and edit calendar 
entries, and enter and sort contacts. You also find out how to update or 
restore your iPod touch, and reset its settings.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this book’s Part of Tens chapters, I provide ten tips that can help make 
your iPod touch experience a completely satisfying one, and describe ten 
iPod touch apps that will rock your world.

Part I
Touching All the 
Basics

I 
touch all the basics in this ﬁ rst part to get you 
started with your iPod touch as quickly as 
possible. 
I start you out with a power punch in Chapter 1: 
opening the box, sorting out its contents, and then 
powering up the iPod touch and connecting it to 
iTunes (the software that synchronizes content 
with it). You also ﬁ nd out how to get the most 
from your battery.
Next, I show you how touch it — the multi-touch 
interface that drives the iPod touch. You get a 
quick tour of the Home screen, the icons, and the 
onscreen keyboard, including tricks like how to 
quickly type numbers and switch the keyboard to 
another language.
Then, in Chapter 3, I set you up with the right time 
and date, clocks for different time zones, alarms, 
the timer, and the stopwatch. You discover how 
to set a passcode to lock your iPod touch so that 
no one else can use it. You also ﬁ nd out how to set 
the display’s brightness, turn the sound effects on 
or off, change the wallpaper that appears on the 
locked screen, and set restrictions so that your 
kids can’t jump onto YouTube or download 
explicit tunes.

Powering Up Your iPod touch
In This Chapter
▶ Looking inside the box
▶ Finding out what your iPod touch is good for
▶ Connecting to your computer and iTunes
▶ Using and recharging your battery
You hold in your hands the greatest portable music player in the world, 
which also happens to be the greatest portable video and game player. 
But that’s not all: With built-in wireless Internet connectivity, the iPod touch 
defines an entire new class of . . . thing.
I want to call it a device, but it’s so much more — the iPod touch puts the 
entire world in your pocket. Not only can you download tunes 
and games directly to your iPod touch, but you can also 
select from a library of over 50,000 applications (known 
as apps) that offer everything from soup to nuts. Apps 
come in the form of databases that serve up local 
restaurants based on your location; utility pro-
grams that connect you with social networks like 
Facebook; and a plethora of navigation, lifestyle, 
health, sports, reference, finance, productivity, and 
travel aids. Apps even let you send and receive 
e-mail and visit your favorite Web sites.
Less than a third of an inch thick and weighing only 4 
ounces, the iPod touch is really a computer — it uses 
a flash memory drive and an operating system that can 
run applications. It shares the design characteristics and 
many of the features of its more famous cousin, the iPhone, 
with the same built-in speaker and volume controls on the left 
side and the same touch-sensitive glass display. And with the iPhone 3 
Software Update for the iPod touch (available seperately for older models), 
it can do nearly everything an iPhone can do, except make cellular-service 
phone calls and pinpoint its exact location with the Global Positioning 
System (GPS). Even so, the iPod touch can pinpoint its approximate location 

8
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
with Internet-based location services, and you can make phone calls using 
the Skype app, an Internet connection, and an external microphone. It also 
offers stereo Bluetooth for using wireless headphones and microphones.
So what’s in the box, and what can it do?
Thinking Inside the Box
Apple excels at packaging. Don’t destroy the elegant box while opening it, 
and check to make sure that all the correct parts came with it, as shown in 
Figure 1-1. Keep the box in case, heaven forbid, you need to return the iPod 
touch to Apple — the box ensures that you can safely return it for a new bat-
tery or replacement.

Figure 1-1: Inside the box for the iPod touch.
The iPod touch is supplied with the following:
 
✓ Stereo headphones (often called earbuds)
 
✓ A dock adapter fitted for Apple’s Universal Dock 
 
✓ A Dock Connector to USB cable

9
 Chapter 1: Powering Up Your iPod touch
The cable connects your iPod touch (or its dock) to your computer or to the 
AC power adapter using a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connection — a way 
of attaching things to computers and bussing data around while providing 
power. The cable has a USB connector on one end and a flat dock connector 
on the other end to connect either to a dock or directly to an iPod touch.
Outside the box
There are a few things you may want to have around that are not in the 
box. For example, even though you don’t really need an AC power adapter 
or dock — you can connect the iPod touch directly to your computer to 
recharge your battery — a power adapter or dock is useful for keeping the 
battery charged without having to connect the iPod touch to your computer. 
The earbuds supplied with your iPod touch may not suit your tastes, but 
there are a hundred other headphone products that might. You can get all 
kinds of accessories, including headphones, speakers, the Apple Universal 
Dock, other docks, and AC power adapters, from the online Apple Store 
(www.apple.com/store), the physical Apple Store, or other stores such as 
Amazon.com and Frye.
Computer and software not included
You still need a computer and iTunes to manage your content and your iPod 
touch. These things are not in the box, obviously. 
You’ve seen requirements before — lots of jargon about MB (megabytes), GB 
(gigabytes), GHz (gigahertz), and RAM (random access memory), sprinkled 
with names like Intel, AMD, and Mac OS X. Skip this section if you already 
know your iPod touch works with your computer and you already have 
iTunes. But if you don’t know whether it will work, and you don’t have iTunes 
yet, read on. 
You need the following:
 
✓ A PC or Mac to run iTunes: On a PC, iTunes version 8 (version 8.2 as 
of this writing) requires Windows XP (with Service Pack 2), or either 
32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows Vista, running on a 1GHz Intel or 
AMD processor with a QuickTime-compatible audio card, and a mini-
mum of 512MB of RAM; 1GB is required to play HD-quality videos. You 
need a DirectX 9.0–compatible video card with 32MB of video RAM 
(64MB recommended) to watch video, and a 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or 
faster processor to play HD-quality videos from the iTunes Store. 
 
 With a Mac, iTunes version 8.2 runs on all versions of Mac OS X (Leopard 
and Snow Leopard), and on older Mac OS X (Tiger) versions 10.4.9 
(version 10.4.10 or newer required for iPhone). You need a 500 MHz 
processor or better (Intel or PowerPC), and at least 512MB of RAM; 1GB 

10
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
of RAM is required to play HD-quality videos. You also need an Intel 
PowerPC G5 or a 1GHz PowerPC G4 or faster processor; 16MB of video 
RAM, to watch video; and a 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor to 
play HD-quality videos from the iTunes Store.
 
✓ USB connection: You need a USB 2.0 connection (also called a high-
powered USB) on your computer. All current-model Macs and many PCs 
provide built-in USB 2.0.
 
 For details about using USB, visit the companion Web site for iPod & 
iTunes For Dummies, 6th Edition, at www.dummies.com/go/ipod6e.
 
✓ iTunes: Make sure you have the current version of iTunes, which also 
includes QuickTime for playing video. You can download iTunes for 
Windows or the Mac from the Apple site (www.apple.com/itunes/
download); it’s free.
Discovering What Your iPod touch Can Do
Play music, audio books, videos, and games; communicate with friends in 
social networks; make travel reservations and see maps of the entire world; 
check the weather and your finances; and keep track of all your appoint-
ments. You can do all this and much, much more by using apps and connect-
ing to the Internet.
Whipping up a multimedia extravaganza
Portable DVD players are cute, but they don’t come anywhere close to being 
as convenient as an iPod touch for playing video. The iPod touch is the Swiss 
Army Knife of media: It plays music, music videos, TV shows, movies, audio 
books, slideshows, and podcasts (audio and video episodes designed to be 
downloaded to your iPod touch).
The convenience of carrying content on an iPod touch is phenomenal. For 
example, the 32GB iPod touch can hold around 7,000 songs. That’s more than 
a week of nonstop music played around the clock. 
Apple offers the following sizes of iPod touch models as of this writing:
 
✓ The 8GB model holds about 1,750 songs, 10,000 photos, or about 10 
hours of video. 
 
✓ The 16GB model holds about 3,500 songs, 20,000 photos, or about 20 
hours of video. 
 
✓ The 32GB model holds about 7,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or about 40 
hours of video. 

11
 Chapter 1: Powering Up Your iPod touch
All three models use the same battery that offers up to 36 hours of music 
playback, or 6 hours of video playback.
 
For a nifty chart that shows the differences between iPod models, see the 
Identifying iPod Models page on the Apple iPod Web site (http://support.
apple.com/kb/HT1353).
How do you get 7,000 songs (or for that matter, any number of songs) onto 
your iPod touch quickly? If you have an iTunes library of songs, you can fill up 
your iPod touch by connecting it to your computer (as I describe later in this 
chapter) and synchronizing it with iTunes (as I describe in Chapter 5). You 
can also download songs from the iTunes Store, as I describe in Chapter 4. 
Even audio books and videos — some of your favorite TV shows, plus music 
videos and full-length movies — are just a touch away on your iPod touch, or 
a click away in iTunes. 
 
You use iTunes to organize your content, make copies, burn CDs, and play 
disc jockey without discs. To find out more, see my other book, iPod & iTunes 
For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
The iPod touch can also show pictures. Its 3.5-inch, widescreen, multi-touch 
display offers 480-x-320–pixel resolution at 160 dots per inch for crisp photos 
and video pictures. You organize your photos on your computer and then 
transfer them to your iPod touch using iTunes, as I describe in Chapter 9.
Communicating with the world
Your iPod touch can sense Wi-Fi networks. (Wi-Fi, short for wireless fidelity, 
is a popular connection method for local area networks and the Internet; you 
can set up your home or office with Wi-Fi using an inexpensive Wi-Fi hub, 
such as Apple’s AirPort Extreme.) After it finds one or more networks, the 
iPod touch lets you choose one to connect to the Internet, and it can remem-
ber the settings for that network so that it can automatically choose the same 
network again. 
With a Wi-Fi connection, you can use the Safari app to browse the Web and 
interact with Web services, and you can use the Mail app to send and receive 
e-mail. Stocks, Maps, and Weather are apps that show information from the 
Internet. You can also use the YouTube app to play YouTube videos on the 
Web. All these apps are supplied with your iPod touch.
You can download more apps to your iPod touch by connecting to Wi-Fi 
and the Internet, and tapping the App Store icon. You can download music, 
videos, and podcasts by tapping the iTunes icon, as I describe in Chapter 4.

12
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
You also use apps to connect to the Internet in other ways than browsing. 
For example, popular social networks such as Facebook and MySpace offer 
apps to connect you with your friends on those services. Google offers an 
array of services through the Google Mobile app, including the ability to edit 
documents and spreadsheets, use the Gmail service, and share calendars 
and photos. The Twitterific app lets you post tweets on Twitter, and the 
WhosHere and Loopt apps can connect you directly to other iPod touch and 
iPhone users for chatting.
Rolling the dice
Many of the apps you’ll find listed at the App store are especially designed 
to take advantage of three distinct features of the iPod touch: its multitouch 
display; its accelerometer (which detects acceleration, rotation, motion ges-
tures, and tilt); and its ability to detect its physical location. 
For example, Motion X Poker — actually a dice game — uses the accelero-
meter to let you roll the dice by shaking the iPod touch. The Flick Fishing app 
senses motion so you can cast a fishing line with a flick of the wrist. And for 
really precise motion, try rolling a steel ball over a wooden labyrinth of holes 
in the free Labyrinth Lite app.
Sensing your iPod touch’s location is a very useful feature. The Showtimes 
app uses your iPod touch’s location to show the movie theaters closest to 
you. The Eventful app uses your location to display local events and venues, 
and the Lethal app can tell you the dangers which could surround you — the 
hostile animals, the likelihood of crimes, the prevalence of disease, and the 
potential accidents and disasters.
So now you know a bit about what the iPod touch can do. It’s time to fire up 
this baby and start rockin’ out. 
Connecting to Power
Awaken your iPod touch by pressing the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button, which 
is located on the top of the iPod touch, as shown in Figure 1-2. (The black 
oval on the back and near the top is the Wi-Fi antenna — don’t cover this up 
if you’re trying to access Wi-Fi.) 
If you press the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button again, it puts the iPod touch 
back to sleep and locks its controls to save battery power. 

13
 Chapter 1: Powering Up Your iPod touch
You can turn the iPod touch completely off by holding down the Sleep/Wake 
(On/Off) button for about two seconds, until you see the Slide to Power Off 
slider; then slide your finger across the slider to turn it off. You can then 
turn it back on by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button. To 
save battery power, you should plug the iPod touch into AC power or your 
computer before turning it back on from a completely off state. (For battery 
details, see the “Facing Charges of Battery” section in this chapter.)

Figure 1-2: The top of the iPod touch.
You can supply power to your iPod touch (and charge your battery at the 
same time) by using the provided cable and your computer, or you can use 
an optional AC power adapter that works with voltages in North America and 
many parts of Europe and Asia. 
On the bottom of the iPod touch, you find one large connection called the Dock 
Connector and a smaller connection for headphones, as shown in Figure 1-3. 
The Dock Connector mirrors the connection on the end of a dock — your iPod 
touch fits snugly in a dock, and then the dock offers the Dock Connector for 
your computer.

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
Do you want your iPod touch to stand upright? Just connect it to an Apple or 
a third-party dock and then use the cable supplied with your iPod touch to 
connect the dock to your computer or power adapter. The dock keeps your 
iPod touch in an upright position while connected and also provides connec-
tions for a home stereo or headphones. Some docks offer built-in speakers. A 
dock can be convenient as a base station when you’re not traveling with your 
iPod touch, because you can slip it into the dock without connecting cables. 
You can pick up a dock at an Apple Store, order one online, or take advantage 
of third-party dock offerings.
To connect your iPod touch to your computer, plug the flat connector of the 
supplied cable into the iPod touch Dock Connector (refer to Figure 1-3), and 
then plug the USB part on the other end into the USB port on your computer. 
You can connect the USB end of the supplied cable to either the Apple (or 
third-party USB) power adapter for power, or to the computer’s USB 2.0 port 
for power. As soon as you connect it to the computer, iTunes starts up and 
begins syncing the iPod touch (see Chapter 5). After syncing, the computer 
continues to provide power through the USB 2.0 port to the iPod touch.
Why USB 2.0? What happened to 1.0? Most PCs and all current Macs already 
have USB 2.0, which is all you need to provide power and to sync an iPod 
touch with your computer. Although you can use a low-powered USB 1.0 or 
1.1 connection to sync your iPod touch, it doesn’t supply enough power to 
charge the iPod touch battery, and it’s slower than molasses for syncing on a 
subzero morning.
 
Don’t use another USB device in a chain and don’t use a USB 2.0 hub to 
connect your iPod touch unless the hub is a powered hub — a hub with a 
separate power source, in other words. Note that a USB keyboard typically 
acts like a USB 1.1 hub, but it’s not powered, so it can’t provide power to 
the iPod touch.
After adding power, your iPod touch comes alive and displays the image of 
the USB cable and the iTunes icon. This is a simple message telling you to 
connect the iPod touch to iTunes on your computer. 
iTunes is the software that manages your library of content and apps on your 
computer, and enables you to sync apps, content, and personal information 
with your iPod touch, as well as update the iPod touch software and restore 
it to original factory settings if you need to.
Macs already have iTunes, and setting up iTunes on a Windows PC is a quick 
and easy process. The most up-to-date version of iTunes as of this writing 
is version 8.2. However, software updates occur very rapidly. If you really 
want the latest version, go directly to the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/
itunes) to get it. You can download iTunes for free.

15
 Chapter 1: Powering Up Your iPod touch
For details on how to install iTunes, see the instructions on Apple’s Web site 
or see my other book, iPod & iTunes For Dummies.
Be aware that, for your new iPod touch and iTunes to play nice with each 
other, you first have to get iTunes to recognize your new device; they have to 
be introduced, in other words. You do that by using the Register and Set Up 
screen, as spelled out in the following steps:
 
1. With iTunes open, connect your iPod touch to the computer with a 
USB cable.
 
 iTunes recognizes the iPod touch and opens the Register and Set Up 
screen to get you started. 
 
 If the iPod touch isn’t recognized in a few minutes, make sure it’s 
charged. A lightning bolt battery icon appears when it’s asleep and con-
nected to power — if you don’t see this icon, iPod touch isn’t charging 
properly, and you may need to try a different cable or try a different 
USB 2.0 connection. (For more battery details, see the section “Facing 
Charges of Battery” in this chapter.) If the iPod touch is charged and 
still not recognized, try putting it to sleep and waking it again (see the 
preceding section). If that doesn’t make your iPod touch recognizable 
by iTunes, try resetting your iPod touch as described in Chapter 14. If 
all else fails, try restarting your computer, and if that doesn’t help, try 
re-installing iTunes. Finally, contact Apple Support to return your iPod 
touch for repair (www.apple.com/support).
 
2. Click Continue (or click Register Later to skip the registration process).
 
 iTunes displays the License Agreement. You can scroll down to read it if 
you want. You must choose to accept the agreement, or the installer goes 
no further. (If you click to Register Later, you get to skip a few screens in 
the set-up process, but you don’t get to skip the license agreement.)
 
 I don’t recommend skipping the registration screens unless you intend 
to register the device later; registration helps you get better service 
from Apple in case you need it.
 
3. Click the option to accept the terms at the end of the License 
Agreement and then click Continue. 
 
 After clicking Continue, iTunes lets you register your iPod touch with 
Apple online so you can take advantage of Apple support. You see a 
screen for entering your Apple ID; a membership ID for the MobileMe 
(formerly .Mac) service is also valid. 
 
4. Select the option (Use My Apple ID to Register My iPod or I Do Not 
Have an Apple ID) that applies to you and fill in the info beneath that 
option.
 
 How you handle this step depends on how you purchased your iPod 
touch. Here’s the scoop:

16
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
• If you purchased your iPod touch directly from Apple and you 
have an Apple Store or MobileMe ID, select the Use My Apple ID to 
Register My iPod option and enter the ID and password to swiftly 
move through the registration process. Apple automatically rec-
ognizes your purchase so that you don’t need to enter the serial 
number.
 
• If you bought your iPod touch elsewhere or you don’t have an 
Apple ID or MobileMe ID, select the I Do Not Have an Apple ID 
option. If needed, select your country from the pop-up menu below 
that. When you click Continue, iTunes displays a screen for enter-
ing your iPod touch serial number and your personal information. 
Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required, such as your name 
and e-mail address.
 
 Got a magnifying glass? You can find the iPod touch serial number on 
the back of the device or on the side of its packaging.
 
5. Click Continue to advance through each screen in the registration pro-
cess and click Submit at the end to submit your information. 
 
 After clicking Submit, iTunes displays a screen that lets you enter a 
name for your iPod touch, as shown in Figure 1-4.
 
Figure 1-4: Name your iPod touch and automatically synchronize content in one step.

17
 Chapter 1: Powering Up Your iPod touch
 
 If you’ve synchronized an iPod touch or iPhone previously on the same 
computer, iTunes displays an extra screen that lets you either restore 
settings from a previously backed-up iPod or iPhone, or you can set this 
iPod touch up as a new one. Choose which option you prefer and then 
click Continue.
 
6. Give your iPod touch a name, set the automatic options, and then 
click Done (on a Mac) or Finish (on Windows).
 
 It’s nice to give your iPod touch a name to give it more of a personality. 
And when it comes to setting automatic options (refer to Figure 1-4), 
here’s the deal: 
 
• Automatically Sync Songs and Videos: If you want to copy your 
entire iTunes music and video library onto your iPod touch, leave 
the Automatically Sync Songs and Videos option selected. If you 
want to control which portion of your library is copied to the iPod 
touch, deselect this option and turn to Chapter 5 for synchroniza-
tion details.
 
• Automatically Add Photos: Select this option to copy all the photos 
in your Pictures folder or photo library to your iPod touch. (See 
Chapter 9 for information about synchronizing photo libraries.) 
Leave it deselected if you want to transfer photos later.
 
• Automatically Sync Applications: Select this option to copy all iPod 
touch apps in your iTunes library to your iPod touch.
Don’t want to add songs or videos now? If you deselect the option to auto-
matically synchronize (refer to Figure 1-4), you can still add songs and videos 
later, along with podcasts and audio books — either manually or automati-
cally, as I describe in Chapter 5.
After finishing setup, your iPod touch name appears in the iTunes Source 
pane (the left column) under the Devices heading (refer to Figure 1-6). Click 
this name to display information about your iPod touch in the main part 
of the iTunes window. The information you see also includes a message to 
update your iPod touch if Apple has an update for it. If you see this message, 
click the Update button to update your iPod touch. If you have an earlier 
model iPod touch, you can download the iPhone Software update (sold 
seperately) to bring it up to date. See Chapter 14 for details.
If you chose the option to automatically synchronize your songs and videos, 
your iPod touch quickly fills up with music and videos from your iTunes 
library. 
You can leave your iPod touch connected to the computer, using the com-
puter as a source of power — the iPod touch appears in iTunes whenever 
you start iTunes. 

18
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
To disconnect it from iTunes and your computer, click the eject button next 
to the iPod touch name (refer to Figure 1-4) in the Source pane. (The eject 
button shows a triangle with a line beneath it.)
 
After ejecting the iPod touch, wait for its display to show the Home screen or 
the slider to unlock it (or for it to go to sleep, which it should do in a few min-
utes). You can then disconnect the iPod touch from the computer. Don’t ever 
disconnect an iPod touch before ejecting it because such bad behavior might 
cause it to freeze up and require a reset. (If that happens, see Chapter 14 for 
instructions.)
Facing Charges of Battery
You can take a six-hour flight from New York City to California and listen to 
your iPod touch the entire time — and with some models, listen all the way 
back on the return flight — without recharging. The iPod touch uses a built-
in, rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery that offers 36 hours of music 
playing time or 6 hours of video, browsing the Internet, or displaying photo 
slideshows with music.
Recharging your battery
The iPod touch battery recharges automatically when you connect it to 
a power source. For example, it starts charging immediately when you 
insert it into a dock that’s connected to a power source (or to a computer 
with a powered USB connection). It takes only four hours to recharge the 
battery fully.
 
Need power when you’re on the run? Look for a power outlet in the airport 
terminal or hotel lobby and plug in your iPod touch with your AC power 
adapter — the battery fast-charges to 80 percent capacity in two hours. After 
that, the battery receives a trickle charge for the next two hours until it’s 
fully charged.
 
Don’t fry your iPod touch with some generic power adapter. Use only the 
power adapter from Apple or a certified iPod adapter, such as the power 
accessories from Belkin, Griffin, Monster, XtremeMac, and other vendors.
When you awaken an iPod touch that’s plugged into power, you see a large 
battery icon indicating how much juice you have. When you charge the bat-
tery, the large battery icon includes a lightning bolt.
You can also use your iPod touch while the battery is charging, or you can 
disconnect it and use it before the battery is fully charged. The small battery 
icon in the top-right corner of the iPod touch display indicates how much 
power is left. It’s completely filled in when the battery is fully charged, and it 

19
 Chapter 1: Powering Up Your iPod touch
slowly empties out into just an outline as the battery is used up. A lightning 
bolt appears inside it when recharging, and a plug appears inside when the 
iPod touch is connected to power.
 
The iPod touch built-in, rechargeable battery is, essentially, a life-or-death 
proposition. After it’s dead, it can be replaced, but Apple charges a replace-
ment fee plus shipping. If your warranty is still active, you should have Apple 
replace it under the warranty program (which may cost nothing except per-
haps shipping). Don’t try to replace it yourself because opening your iPod 
touch invalidates the warranty. 
 
Keeping an iPod touch in a snug carrying case when charging is tempting but 
also potentially disastrous. You could damage the unit by overheating it and 
frying its circuits, rendering it as useful as a paperweight. To get around this 
problem, you can purchase one of the heat-dissipating carrying cases avail-
able in the Apple Store. 
If you don’t use your iPod touch for a month, even while it’s connected 
to power and retaining a charge, it can become catatonic. Perhaps it gets 
depressed from being left alone too long. At that point it may not start — you 
have to completely drain and recharge the battery. To drain the battery, leave 
your iPod touch unconnected to power for 24 hours. Then, to fully recharge 
the battery, connect it to power for at least 4 hours without using it (or longer 
if you are using it). 
Saving power
The iPod touch uses power accessing the Internet, using Bluetooth devices, 
and running apps. Keeping these activities to a minimum can help you 
save power.
 
The following are tips on saving power while using your iPod touch:
 
✓ Pause. Pause playback when you’re not listening. Pausing (stopping) 
playback is the easiest way to conserve power.
 
✓ Lock it. Press the Sleep/Wake button on top of the iPod touch to 
immediately put it to sleep and lock its controls to save battery power. 
You can set your iPod touch to automatically go to sleep by choosing 
Settings➪General➪Auto-Lock from the Home screen, and choosing 1 
Minute, 2 Minutes, 3 Minutes, 4 Minutes, or 5 Minutes (or Never, to 
prevent automatic sleep).
 
✓ Back away from the light. Turn down the brightness on an iPod touch 
by choosing Settings➪Brightness and dragging the brightness slider to 
the left. 

20
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
✓ Forget where you are. Turn off Location Services if you aren’t using 
apps that need it. Choose Settings➪General from the Home screen, and 
touch On for the Location Services option to turn it off. See Chapter 3 
for details.
 
✓ Let the postman ring twice. Check e-mail less frequently. You may want 
to change Push and Fetch settings to be less frequent. See Chapter 11 for 
details.
 
✓ Put a cap on Bluetooth. Turn off Bluetooth (choose Settings➪General➪
Bluetooth and touch the On button to turn it off) if you’re not using a 
Bluetooth device. (Bluetooth is available only with the iPhone 3 Software 
Update.)
 
✓ Stop communicating altogether. Turn off Wi-Fi when not browsing the 
Internet: Choose Settings➪Wi-Fi and touch the On button to turn it off.
 
✓ Turn it off completely. You can turn the iPod touch completely off by 
holding down the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button for about two seconds, 
until you see the Slide to Power Off slider; then slide your finger across 
the slider to turn it off. You can then turn it back on by pressing and 
holding the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button.
 
 Keep in mind that starting up an iPod touch that was completely turned 
off takes quite a bit of power — more than if it woke from sleep. If you 
do turn it off, plug it into AC power or your computer before turning it 
back on.
 
✓ You may continue. Play songs continuously without using the iPod 
touch controls. Selecting songs and using Previous/Rewind and Next/
Fast-Forward require more energy. Also, turn off your iPod touch 
equalizer (EQ) if you turned it on (see Chapter 7).
Always use the latest iPod touch software and update your software when 
updates come out. Apple constantly tries to improve how your iPod touch 
works, and many of these advancements relate to power usage.

Putting Your Finger On It
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a quick tour around the iPod touch
▶ Touching and gesturing 
▶ Typing on the onscreen keyboard
▶ Typing in different languages
W
ith an iPod touch, your fingers do the walking. The multi-touch glass 
screen lets you make gestures to do things, such as flicking a finger 
to scroll a list quickly, sliding your finger to scroll slowly or to drag a slider 
(such as the volume slider), pinching with two fingers to zoom out of a Web 
page in Safari, or pulling apart with two fingers (also known as unpinching) 
to zoom in to the page to see it more clearly.
This chapter gives you a quick tour of the iPod touch Home 
screen and icons, and it describes all the touch-and-
gesture tricks to make your iPod touch dance and sing. 
I also give you a complete tour of the most unique fea-
ture of the iPod touch: the onscreen keyboard.
Going on a Quick Tour 
of the iPod touch
The iPod touch responds to tapping, flicking, and 
sliding your finger, among other gestures (such as 
shaking, tilting, two-finger tapping, and so on). One 
tap is all you need to run an app or select something, but 
sometimes you have to slide your finger to scroll the display 
and see more selections. 
 
Sticky fingers are not recommended. To clean your iPod touch, make sure 
to unplug all cables and turn it off. (See Chapter 1.) Use a soft, slightly 
damp, lint-free cloth to wipe your iPod touch clean — see Chapter 15 for 
cleaning tips.

22
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Sliding to the Home screen
The first message you see on an iPod touch display (besides the time of day 
and the date) is Slide to unlock — to get started, you have to unlock the 
iPod touch by sliding your finger across the message. Once unlocked, your 
Home screen appears in all its glory. (See Figure 2-1.)
There’s no place like 
Home — it’s the 
screen where you start. 
Everything is available 
from the Home screen at 
the touch of a finger (see 
Figure 2-1). For example:
 
✓ Tap the Music icon to 
access your music.
 
✓ Tap the Videos 
icon to access your 
videos.
 
✓ Tap the Photos 
icon to access your 
photos.
 
✓ Tap the iTunes icon 
to access the iTunes 
Store.
 
✓ Tap the App Store icon to access the App Store.
After tapping an icon on the iPod touch screen, a new screen appears with 
selections and icons. (Touching Music, for example, brings up Artists, Songs, 
Albums, and so on.) The multi-touch interface changes for each app. Press 
the physical Home button below the screen at any time to go to back to the 
Home screen.
Apps you download from the App Store (as I describe in Chapter 4) show 
up as icons on your Home screen. You can also save Web Clips to your 
Home screen as icons that take you directly to those Web pages (as I 
describe in Chapter 10). When you add enough apps and Web Clips so that 
they no longer all fit on the first page of the Home screen, the iPod touch 
automatically creates more Home screen pages to accommodate them.
The bottom row of the Home screen (the one holding the Safari, Music, 
Videos, and App Store icons, as shown in Figure 2-1) is called the dock. The 
number of dots above the dock shows the number of Home screen pages you 
have, and it indicates which page you’re viewing. To switch to another Home 
screen page, flick with your finger left or right, or tap to the left or right of the 
row of dots.

 Chapter 2: Putting Your Finger On It
You can also create additional Home screens yourself. Touch and hold any 
icon until all the icons begin to wiggle. (That’s right, it looks like they’re 
doing the Wa-Wa-Watusi.) Then drag a wiggling icon to the right edge of the 
screen until a new page appears. You can flick to return to the original Home 
screen page and drag more wiggling icons to the new page. You can create up 
to nine Home screen pages. 
 
Press the Home button under the screen to go to back to the first Home 
screen.
While the wiggling icons are doing their show, you can also rearrange them. 
Drag the wiggling icons into new positions, and the other icons move to 
accommodate, creating a new arrangement. 
 
You can also delete apps you downloaded from the App Store by tapping the 
circled X that appears inside the icon as it wiggles.
To stop all that wiggling, press the Home button, which saves your new 
arrangement and pages.
To reset your Home screen to the default arrangement, thereby clean-
ing up any mess you may have made on your Home screens, tap 
Settings➪General➪Reset➪Reset Home Screen Layout.
Status bar
The iPod touch shows its current state in the status bar at the top of the 
screen (refer to Figure 2-1). The icons mean the following:
 
✓ iPod: Just in case you forgot you had an iPod in your hands (very 
existential).
 
✓ Wi-Fi: This icon says the iPod touch is connected to a Wi-Fi network. 
If the network offers Internet access (all commercial ones do), you’re 
on the Internet. The more bars you see in the icon, the stronger the 
connection to the network. To find out more about setting up Wi-Fi with 
Internet in your home, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ Network activity: This icon twirls to show that data is traveling from the 
network to your iPod touch (or vice versa). (Not visible in Figure 2-1.)
 
✓ VPN: If you have special network settings that access a virtual private 
network (VPN), this icon shows up to tell you that you are connected to 
it. See Chapter 4 for details. (Not visible in Figure 2-1.)
 
✓ Lock: You see this icon whenever the iPod touch is locked. (The Slide 
to unlock message also appears on the screen.) (Not visible in 
Figure 2-1.)

24
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
✓ Play: This icon tells you that a song, audio book, or podcast is playing 
(in case you didn’t know — maybe you took your headphones off). (Not 
visible in Figure 2-1.)
 
✓ Alarm: This icon appears if you set an alarm. See Chapter 3 for details. 
(Not visible in Figure 2-1.)
 
✓ Battery: The Battery icon shows the battery level or charging status. 
It’s completely filled in when the battery is fully charged, and it slowly 
empties out into just an outline as the battery is used up. A lightning 
bolt appears inside the icon when the device is recharging, and a plug 
appears inside it when the iPod touch is connected to power.
Searching for anything
The leftmost dot above the dock 
(refer to Figure 2-1) is a search icon. 
Tap the search icon (or flick the 
Home screen with your finger to the 
right) to show the Spotlight Search 
screen (Figure 2-2). Spotlight Search 
works just like the Spotlight univer-
sal search in Mac OS X. You can type 
a search term and immediately see 
suggestions. 
Search looks through contacts, cal-
endars, e-mail (the To:, From:, and 
Subject: fields, but not the message 
content), the content (songs, videos, 
podcasts, and audio books), and 
even the text in the Notes app. Tap 
a contact, calendar entry, e-mail, or 
note suggestion to open it, or tap the 
song, video, podcast, or audio book 
suggestion to play it.
Tons of icons and 
what do you get?
You get flexible apps and a key to 
the net! The iPod touch Home screen 
(refer to Figure 2-1) offers the following icons:
 
✓ Safari: Use the Safari Web browser.
 
✓ Calendar: View your calendar.
 
✓ Mail: Check and send e-mail.
Figure 2-2: The iPod touch Search screen.

25
 Chapter 2: Putting Your Finger On It
 
✓ Contacts: View your contacts.
 
✓ YouTube: List and select videos from YouTube.
 
✓ Stocks: Check the prices for financial stocks, bonds, and funds.
 
✓ Maps: View maps and get driving directions.
 
✓ Weather: View the weather in multiple cities.
 
✓ Clock: View multiple clocks and use the alarm clock, timer, and 
stopwatch.
 
✓ Calculator: You can use your iPod touch as a regular calculator for 
adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and so on. Also, if you hold 
the iPod touch horizontally, it becomes a scientific calculator.
 
✓ Notes: Add text notes.
 
✓ Voice Memos: Add voice recordings (using an external mic).
 
✓ Settings: Adjust settings for Wi-Fi, sounds, brightness, Safari, and other 
apps, as well as other settings for the iPod touch itself.
 
✓ App Store: Go to Apple’s online App Store to download other Apple and 
third-party apps.
 
✓ Music: Select music playlists, artists, songs, albums, and more (includ-
ing podcasts, genres, composers, audio books, and compilations). The 
Music icon also offers Cover Flow browsing, as I describe in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Videos: Select videos by type (movies, music videos, TV shows, or video 
podcasts). 
 
✓ Photos: Select photos by photo album or select individual photos in the 
Photo Library. 
 
✓ iTunes: Go to the iTunes online store to purchase content.
There’s one more icon for an app that you can activate in Settings, if 
you have the appropriate Nike shoes and the Nike+ iPod Sport Kit, sold 
separately. See Chapter 15 for details.
Touching and Gesturing
With the iPod touch, it’s touch and go. The iPod touch responds to the 
following gestures you make with your fingers:
 
✓ Drag with your finger: Scroll up or down lists slowly.
 
✓ Flick up or down: Swipe your finger quickly across the surface to scroll 
up or down lists rapidly.
 
✓ Touch and hold: While scrolling, touch and hold to stop the moving list.

26
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
✓ Flick from left to right or right to left: Quickly swipe your finger across 
the screen to change screens or application panes (Home screens, 
Cover Flow view in Music, Weather, and other apps). 
 
✓ Single tap: Select an item.
 
✓ Double tap: Zoom in or out with Safari, Maps, and other applications.
 
✓ Two-finger single tap: Zoom out in Maps.
 
✓ Pinch: Zoom out.
 
✓ Unpinch: Zoom in.
 
Need to practice your tapping? Try Tap Tap Revenge, a rhythm game that 
plays music while requiring you to tap each of the colored balls when they 
reach the line at the bottom of the screen. If you tap the ball on the beat, you 
gain points; if not, it counts as a miss. You can also activate a revenge mode 
to score more points by shaking the iPod touch after setting a winning streak 
of 50 beats.
Shake, rattle, and roll
Your iPod touch can sense motion using a built-in 
accelerometer. When you rotate it from a vertical 
view (portrait) to a horizontal view (landscape), 
the accelerometer detects the movement and 
changes the display accordingly. This happens 
so quickly that you can control a game with these 
movements.
For example, Pass the Pigs is a dice game in 
which you shake three times to roll your pigs to 
gain points. In the Labyrinth game, you tilt your 
iPod touch to roll a ball through a wooden maze 
without falling through the holes. And you can 
shake, rattle, and roll your way around the world in 
Yahtzee Adventures as you rack up high scores. 
And if that’s too tame for you, try Chopper, 
a helicopter game in which you need to 
complete your mission and return to base while 
avoiding enemy fire from tanks and bazooka-
wielding madmen. You tilt the iPod touch to fly, 
and you touch the screen to drop bombs or fire 
the machine gun.
Xhake Shake lets you shake, flip, rub, and tap 
your iPod touch to challenge your hand-eye 
responses. And for scrolling practice, try Light 
Bike (loosely based on the Disney movie Tron) in 
which you scroll to maneuver a light bike from a 
third-person perspective against three computer-
controlled light bikes. And infants can join the fun: 
Silver Rattle shows a screen that changes color 
and rattles with every shake. Big Joe Turner 
would be proud.

27
 Chapter 2: Putting Your Finger On It
Tickling the Keyboard
One trick that’s sure to amaze your friends is the ability to whip out your 
iPod touch and type notes, contact information, calendar entries, map 
locations, stock symbols, and even the addresses for Web sites. You can 
also make selections for pop-up menus. You can do all this with the onscreen 
keyboard.
You may want to start practicing on the keyboard with just one finger, and 
as you get used to it, try also using your thumb. Tap a text entry field, such 
as the URL field for a Web page in Safari (as I describe in Chapter 10) or 
the text of an e-mail message (as I describe in Chapter 11), and the onscreen 
keyboard appears. 
Typing text, numbers, and symbols (using Notes)
You can practice your technique using the Notes app. Tap Notes on the 
Home screen, and the onscreen keyboard appears with letters of the 
alphabet, as shown in Figure 2-3 on the left. (If you’ve already saved notes, 
a list of notes appears — tap the + button in the upper-right corner to type a 
new note.)
Tap the keys, and as you type, each letter appears above your thumb or 
finger. If you tap the wrong key, slide your finger to the correct key. The 
letter isn’t entered until you lift your finger from the key. 
 
 
Figure 2-3: Type characters (left) and numbers (right).

28
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
To enter numbers, symbols, or punctuation, tap the .?123 key at the bottom-
left corner of the keyboard (refer to Figure 2-3, left side), which changes the 
keyboard layout to numbers (refer to Figure 2-3, right side). After tapping 
the .?123 key, you can then tap the #+= key to change the keyboard layout to 
symbols. To return to the alphabetical keys, tap the ABC key.
 
You can start a new sentence quickly by double-tapping the spacebar to 
insert a period followed by a space. The keyboard automatically capitalizes 
the next word after you type a period, a question mark, or an exclamation 
point. 
To enable caps lock (locking the keyboard to uppercase letters), choose 
Settings➪General➪Keyboard and then tap the Off button next to Enable Caps 
Lock to turn it on. (Tap it again to turn it off.) You can then double-tap the 
Shift key to turn on lock caps (uppercase letters). The Shift key turns blue, 
and all letters you type are uppercase. Tap the Shift key again to turn caps 
lock off.
To save your note, tap Done in the upper-right corner. A list of Notes appears 
with a date attached to each note. You can also delete a note by choosing the 
note and tapping the trash icon at the bottom of the note.
 
You can transfer notes you type in Notes to your computer by e-mailing them 
to yourself. Choose the note from the Notes screen and tap the envelope icon 
at the bottom of the note to display a ready-made e-mail message containing 
the text of your note — all you need to do is enter the e-mail address. See 
Chapter 11 for details on sending the message.
 
Here’s a trick you can use to switch to the numeric keyboard layout and back 
to alphabetical layout automatically, in order to type a number and continue 
typing letters: Touch and hold down the .?123 key and then slide your finger 
over the keyboard to the number you want. Release your finger to select the 
number. The onscreen keyboard reverts back immediately to alphabetical 
keys so that you can continue typing letters.
 
Need to use an accent mark? For instance, the word café should really have 
an accent mark over the e, and there may even come a day when you need to 
include a foreign word or two in a note — lycée or Autowäsche or también, 
for example. Although you can switch the language for the keyboard (as I 
describe in Chapter 15), you can also include an accent mark over a vowel by 
using the English keyboard. Hold your finger on a vowel (such as e) to show 
a row of keys that offer variations on the letter. Slide your finger over the row 
to highlight the variation you want and then release your finger to select it.
Editing text and handling word suggestions
Yes, you can edit your mistakes. To edit text in an entry field, touch and hold 
to see the magnifier, which magnifies portions of the text view as shown in 
Figure 2-4 (left side).

29
 Chapter 2: Putting Your Finger On It
 
 
Figure 2-4: Touch and hold for the magnifier (left) and release when positioned correctly (right).
Before releasing your finger, slide 
the magnifier to the position for 
inserting text. After releasing, 
the Select/Select All/Paste bubble 
appears above the insertion 
point, as shown in Figure 2-4 
(right side), which is useful for 
selecting, copying, and pasting 
text (as I describe in the next 
section). You can then tap keys to 
insert text, or you can use the 
backspace key — the key sporting 
the X — to remove text. 
The intelligent keyboard automati-
cally suggests corrections as 
you type, as shown in Figure 2-5 
(some languages only). You don’t 
need to accept the suggested 
word — just continue typing. If 
you do want to accept it, tap the 
spacebar, a punctuation mark, or 
the Return key. iPod touch fills in 
the rest of the word.
To reject the suggested word, finish 
typing the word or tap the x next to 
the suggestion to dismiss it. Each time you reject a suggestion for the same 
Figure 2-5: The keyboard suggests the correct 
word for a typo.

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
word, your iPod touch keeps track and eventually adds the word you’ve been 
using all along to its dictionary. The iPod touch includes dictionaries for 
English, English (UK), French, French (Canada), German, Japanese, Spanish, 
Italian, Dutch, and other languages. The appropriate dictionary is activated 
automatically when you select an international keyboard. (See Chapter 15 for 
details about international keyboards.)
You can turn off suggestions by choosing Settings➪General➪Keyboard from 
the Home screen and tapping On for Auto-Correction. (On changes to Off 
when you tap it.)
Copying (or cutting) and pasting
You can copy or cut a chunk of text and paste it into another app — for 
example, you can copy a paragraph from a note in Notes and paste it into 
an e-mail message in Mail, or vice-versa. You can even copy paragraphs 
from a Web page and paste them in Notes or an e-mail message, as I show in 
Chapter 10.
To select the nearest word (or even the entire text) for copying or cutting, 
touch an insertion point to bring up the magnifier, then release to show the 
Select/Select All/Paste bubble. (Refer to Figure 2-4, right side.) You can then 
tap Select to select the nearest word or tap Select All to select all of the text. 
The Cut/Copy/Paste bubble appears above the text, which is selected with 
handles on either end, as shown in Figure 2-6 (left side). Tap Cut to cut the 
selection, or Copy to copy it.
To paste the cut or copied text somewhere new, open a note (or create a new 
note) in Notes, or start a new e-mail message, or open any app that lets you 
enter text. Touch and hold to magnify the text view so that you can mark an 
insertion point precisely. After you remove your finger, the Cut/Copy/Paste 
bubble appears, or if the message or note already contains text, the Select/
Select All/Paste bubble appears, as shown in Figure 2-6 (right side). Either 
way, you can then tap Paste to paste the text at the insertion point.
 
You can also double-tap a word to select it for copying (or cutting) and 
pasting. You can also make a more precise selection by dragging one of the 
handles. A rectangular magnifier appears for dragging the handle precisely. 
After you remove your finger to stop dragging, the Cut/Copy/Paste bubble 
appears for copying (or cutting) the selection.
Setting keyboard options
To set keyboard options, choose Settings➪General➪Keyboard from the 
Home screen. The Keyboard settings screen appears, with options for Auto-
Correction, Auto-Capitalization, Enable Caps Lock, and the Shortcut for 
inserting a period.

31
 Chapter 2: Putting Your Finger On It
 
 
Figure 2-6: Copy or cut the selected text (left), and paste into a message 
 
(right).
Tap On to turn off Auto-Correction if you don’t want the keyboard to suggest 
typing corrections.
Auto-Capitalization automatically capitalizes the next word after you type 
a period, question mark, or exclamation point (punctuation that ends a 
sentence). It also automatically capitalizes after you tap the Return key. The 
assumption is that you’re starting a new sentence or new line of text that 
should begin with a capital letter. Tap On to turn this feature off if you want; 
tap Off to turn it back on.
To turn on caps lock (locking the keyboard to upper case letters), tap the Off 
button next to Enable Caps Lock. (Tap it again to turn it off.) You can then 
double-tap the Shift key to turn on caps lock (uppercase letters). The Shift 
key turns blue, and all letters you type are uppercase. Tap the Shift key again 
to turn caps lock off.
The Shortcut for inserting a period is to double-tap the spacebar, which 
inserts a period followed by a space. The assumption is that you want to 
finish a sentence and start the next one. Tap On to turn this feature off if you 
want; tap Off to turn it back on.

Clocking, Locking, and 
Personalizing
In This Chapter
▶ Setting the time, date, clock, alarm, timer, and stopwatch
▶ Changing the brightness, wallpaper, sound effects, and restrictions
▶ Locking your iPod touch with a combination passcode
You may think Apple designed the iPod touch just for listening to music 
or watching videos, but those thoughtful engineers crammed a lot more 
features into their invention. You can use your iPod touch as a time-keeper 
to help you keep track of your personal life — setting alarms, using the stop-
watch, and displaying clocks of different time zones for traveling. 
And if you worry that your iPod touch might fall into the 
wrong hands, consider setting a combination lock. This 
chapter shows you how to do all this and more with 
your iPod touch: Find out how to set the brightness of 
the display, set the wallpaper (a stylin’ background 
when it’s locked), turn on its capability to know 
your location, and set restrictions on downloading 
and playing content.
There’s No Time Like 
the Right Time
Your iPod touch may already be set to the correct time, 
date, and time zone, but if not, you can set it yourself and 
even set how the time appears in the status bar at the top of the 
screen. To set the date and time, follow these steps:

34
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
1. Choose Settings➪General➪Date & Time from the Home screen.
 
 The Date & Time screen appears with the 24-Hour Time, Time Zone, Set 
Date & Time options, and time zone support for your calendar. 
 
2. (Optional) Tap the Off button for the 24-Hour Time option to turn it on 
and show military time.
 
 With 24-hour display, 11 p.m. is displayed as 23:00:00 and not 11:00:00. 
To turn off the 24-Hour Time option, tap the On button.
 
3. Tap the Time Zone option to set the time zone.
 
 The onscreen keyboard appears; see Chapter 2 for instructions on how 
to use it. Type the name of the city you’re in (or, if you’re in the middle 
of nowhere, the nearest big city) and tap the Return button on the key-
board, and your iPod touch looks up the time zone for you.
 
4. Tap the Date & Time button in the upper-left corner of the display to 
finish and return to the Date & Time menu.
 
5. Tap the Set Date & Time option.
 
 Tapping the Date field brings up a slot-machine-style Date wheel, as 
shown in Figure 3-1. 
 
6. Slide your finger over the wheel to select the month, day, and year. 
 
 Slide until the selection you want appears in the gray window on the 
slot-machine wheel.
 
7. Tap the Time field to bring up a Time wheel. Slide your finger over 
the wheel to set the hour, minutes, and AM or PM.

Rock Around the Clocks
You can always know what time it is with your iPod touch — just look at the 
time on the Home screen. But you can also know what time it is in other time 
zones by displaying multiple clocks. Your iPod touch even lets you set alarms 
and run a stopwatch.
Checking the time in Paris and Bangkok
You can display clocks with different time zones, which is useful for traveling 
halfway around the world (or calling someone who lives halfway around the 
world). 
To create clocks, tap the Clock icon on the Home screen and tap the World 
Clock icon along the bottom of the display. It takes only two steps to add a 
clock: 
 
1. Touch the plus (+) button in 
the upper-right corner of the 
display.
 
 The onscreen keyboard appears 
with a text entry field.
 
2. Type a city name on the key-
board and tap Return (or tap 
Cancel next to the text entry 
field to cancel).
 
 The iPod touch looks up the 
city’s time zone to display the 
clock. (For details on how to 
use the onscreen keyboard, see 
Chapter 2.)
The initial clock and any clocks you 
add sport a daytime face (white 
background and black hands) from 6 
a.m. to 5:59 p.m., as shown in Figure 
3-2, and a nighttime face (black back-
ground with white hands) from 6 
p.m. to 5:59 a.m.

To remove a clock, tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the display 
(refer to Figure 3-2) and then tap the circled minus (–) button next to the 
clock to delete.
Getting alarmed
Time is on your side with your iPod touch. You can set multiple alarms to go 
off on different days and set a variety of tones and sounds for your alarms 
that play through its speaker. Follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Clock icon on the Home screen and tap the Alarm icon along 
the bottom of the display. 
 
2. To add an alarm, tap the plus (+) button in the upper-right corner of 
the display.
 
 The Add Alarm screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-3, with options and 
a slot-machine-style wheel for setting the alarm time. 
 
3. Slide your finger over the 
wheel to set the hour and 
minute, and AM or PM. 
 
 Slide until the selection you 
want appears in the gray 
window on the slot-machine 
wheel.
 
 Now you can set some optional 
features, or you can skip to Step 
8 and be done with it.
 
4. (Optional) Tap the Repeat

again to turn it back on.
 
 With the Snooze option, the iPod touch displays a Snooze button when 
the alarm goes off, and you tap Snooze to stop the alarm and have it 
repeat in 10 minutes (so that you can snooze for 10 minutes).
 
7. (Optional) Tap the Label option to enter a text label for the alarm.
 
 The label helps you identify the alarm in the Alarm list.
 
8. Tap the Save button in the upper-right corner to save the alarm.
When the alarm goes off, your iPod touch displays the message You have 
an alarm (and the date and time), along with the Snooze button if the 
Snooze option is turned on (refer to Step 6). Slide your finger to unlock the 
iPod touch to stop the alarm’s sound, or tap the Snooze button to stop the 
alarm temporarily and let it repeat 10 minutes later. (When it goes off again, 
slide the unlock slider to turn it off — don’t tap the Snooze button again, 
you’re late for work!)
To delete an alarm, tap the Clock icon on the Home screen and tap the Alarm 
icon along the bottom of the display. In the Alarm list, tap the alarm you want 
to trash and then tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the display. 
The alarm appears with a circled minus (–) button next to it; tap this button 
and then tap the red Delete button that appears to delete the alarm.
Timing your steps
You can set an hour-and-minute timer for anything — baking cookies, 
baking CDs, or baking in the sun on the beach. The timer built into the 
Clock app will continue running even when playing music or videos or run-
ning other iPod touch apps. You might want to use a timer to see whether a 
set of activities — playing songs, playing videos, selecting from menus, and 
running apps — occurs within a specific time. (If you need to use seconds 
as well as minutes and hours, try the stopwatch, which I describe later in 
this section.) 
To use the timer, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Clock icon on the Home screen. 
 
 The Clock display appears.
 
2. Tap the Timer icon along the bottom of the Clock display.
 
 The Timer wheel for minutes and hours appears, along with the Start 
button. 

38
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
3. Flick the timer wheel to set the timer in hours and minutes. 
 
4. Tap the When Timer Ends button and tap a sound to use when the 
timer is up. 
 
5. Tap Set in the upper-right corner of the display to set the sound (or 
Cancel in the upper-left corner to cancel the sound). 
 
6. Tap Start to start the timer.
The timer runs backward. You can touch Cancel to cancel the timer or wait 
until it runs out. When it runs out, the iPod touch plays the sound (if a sound 
is set) and presents an OK button. Tap OK to stop the sound.
Let the good times roll
Lots of games use the iPod touch clock to 
measure time. Some use it against you: Super 
Horsey (see the vertical figure with the chess 
piece) is a very challenging game that puts you 
in the role of the traditional chess knight who 
must complete the labyrinth before the time 
elapses. 
If speed is the issue, SlotZ Racer lets up to four 
people race slot cars on a single iPod touch. 
You can compete for laps or against the clock 
in Time Trials and drive an endurance race 
(with simulated days and nights). SlotZ Track 
Editor lets you create the slot-car track of your 
dreams, with huge and detailed tracks that you 
can trick out with jumps, bridges, and scenery. 
If you enjoy role-playing games that take 
you on a journey with humor and storytelling 
(like Zelda, Pokemon, Dragon Quest, or Final 
Fantasy), try Arvale: Journey of Illusion, which 
offers over 20 hours of game-play, six immense 
continents, 280 maps (see the horizontal figure 
with a map), 200 monsters, hundreds of items 
(including wheelbarrows), and thousands of 
laughs. And in Rock’n’Roll, you’ve messed up 
your enemy’s music game, and all the notes 
have scattered over an island — it’s up to you 
to roll through each level to collect these notes. 
Once all the notes are collected, you move on to 
the next level. But in Rock the Clock mode, there 
are another 15 levels that must be beaten in the 
time provided. Good luck with that!

 Chapter 3: Clocking, Locking, and Personalizing
Using the stopwatch
You can use a stopwatch with a lap timer for timing exercises, jogging, race 
laps, how long it takes the bus to travel across town, or how long your friend 
takes to recognize the song you’re playing. Whatever you want to measure 
with accurate time to the tenth of a second, the stopwatch is ready for you.
 
Even while you’re running the stopwatch, you can still use the iPod touch to 
play music, videos, audio books, and podcasts. When you play a video, the 
stopwatch continues to count as usual; when you switch back to the stop-
watch display, the video automatically pauses.
To use the stopwatch, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Clock icon on the Home screen and tap the Stopwatch icon 
along the bottom of the display. 
 
 A stopwatch appears with Start and Reset buttons and 00:00.00 (min-
utes, seconds, and fractions of seconds) as the stopwatch counter. 
 
2. Tap the Start button to start counting.
 
 The stopwatch starts counting immediately, while the left button changes 
to Stop, and the right button changes to Lap, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
3. (Optional) Tap the Lap button to mark each lap.
 
 Tap the Lap button to record each lap. Repeat this step for each lap.
 
Figure 3-4: After tapping Start (left) and after tapping Lap (right).

40
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
4. Tap the Stop button to stop counting.
 
 The counter stops counting. The left button changes to Start, and the 
right button changes to Reset. You can resume the count from where 
you left off by tapping Start, or you can start the count again from zero 
by tapping Reset.
Setting the Passcode for Your Lock
Your iPod touch locks itself when it goes to sleep, and, as you already know, 
you have to slide your finger over the unlock message to wake it up. But you 
can also set a four-digit combination passcode that keeps the iPod touch 
from waking up unless you supply the passcode. Note: The lock-up works 
only when your iPod touch is not attached to a computer.
If you’re playing music when you lock your iPod touch, the music continues 
playing — and you can even use the Play/Pause button to pause and resume 
playback — but if you set a passcode, no one can navigate the iPod touch or 
even change the volume without providing the combination. 
 
To conserve power, you can force your iPod touch to go to sleep by pressing 
the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button, but it won’t unlock. When it awakes, it 
remembers everything — including the passcode you need to provide.
 
Don’t bother to call Apple to see whether the company can unlock your iPod 
touch for you. If you can’t attach it to the proper computer or enter the cor-
rect passcode combination, your only recourse is to restore the iPod touch 
to its factory conditions — see Chapter 14.
To set a combination passcode, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪General➪Passcode Lock from the Home screen.
 
 The Set Passcode display appears.
 
2. Enter a four-number passcode by tapping numbers on the calculator-
style keypad.
 
 If you change your mind, tap the Cancel button to cancel the operation. 
 
3. Enter the same passcode number again to confirm the passcode.
 
 After entering the passcode again, the Passcode Lock menu appears 
with the Turn Passcode Off, Change Passcode, and Require Passcode 
options.

41
 Chapter 3: Clocking, Locking, and Personalizing
 
4. Select the Passcode option you want to use.
 
 You can turn off the passcode, change it, or set the Require Passcode 
option to Immediately, After 1 Minute, After 5 Minutes, After 15 Minutes, 
After 1 Hour, or After 4 Hours.
 
5. When you’re done, tap General to return to the General menu.
 
Don’t forget this combination! Use a four-digit number that’s easy to commit 
to memory.
To unlock a passcode-locked iPod touch, you must do one of the following:
 
✓ Enter the same combination. After correctly entering the combination, 
the iPod touch unlocks and returns to the last viewed screen.
 
✓ Attach the iPod touch to the computer you used to synchronize it with 
iTunes. When you disconnect it after synchronizing with iTunes, the 
iPod touch is no longer locked with a passcode.
 
✓ Restore your iPod touch to its original factory settings. As I describe 
in Chapter 14, this erases everything in the process. This is, of course, a 
measure of last resort.
After setting a passcode, you can set how long to wait before the passcode 
is required by choosing Settings➪General➪Passcode Lock from the Home 
screen and then entering your passcode. Tap Require Passcode and then 
select how long the iPod touch can be idle before you need to enter a pass-
code to unlock it.
You can also set the option to erase data after ten failed passcode attempts. 
Choose Settings➪General➪Passcode Lock from the Home screen, and then 
enter your passcode. Tap Erase Data to turn it on.
 
With the Erase Data option turned on, if anyone (including you) tries ten 
times to enter the passcode and fails each time, your iPod touch settings are 
reset to their defaults and all your information and media are removed by 
overwriting the data. It’s as if the Mission: Impossible force had set it to self-
destruct. Your iPod touch is restored to factory conditions, so you might as 
well go to Chapter 14 to see what that means.
Getting Personal
Your future might be so bright that you gotta wear shades, but your iPod 
touch display might not be bright enough. And it still needs that personal 
touch that only wallpaper can bring.

42
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
And of course, there are the keyboard clicks and alert sounds you can use 
to indicate that e-mail has arrived, that something in your calendar needs 
attention, and so on. Screen brightness, wallpaper, and sound effects are a 
lot to keep track of, but your iPod touch makes customizing each feature so 
doggone easy.
If you share your iPod touch with children or adults that act like children, 
you may want to place restrictions that prevent explicit music from the 
iTunes Store from being displayed in playlists, or prevent the use of apps 
such as YouTube, or stop any access to the iTunes Store or App Store. Your 
iPod touch can let you do that, too.
Brightening and wallpapering
To adjust the brightness, first tap the Settings icon on the Home screen 
and then tap Brightness, which is near the top of the Settings screen. The 
Brightness screen appears with a slider that shows the brightness setting, 
which ranges from low (a dim sun icon) to high (a bright sun icon). Slide 
the brightness slider’s knob with your finger to the right to increase the 
brightness (toward the bright sun) and to the left to decrease the brightness 
(toward the dim sun). Of course, the brighter the screen, the more power it 
draws from the battery.
While you’re at it, why not wallpaper your display? You can make your iPod 
touch display a stylish background when it’s locked. You can also put up 
photos or other images from your photo library as your wallpaper.
It’s not like you’ll see it often — the iPod touch displays the wallpaper image 
only when you first press the Sleep/Wake button. After you swipe with your 
finger to unlock your iPod touch, the wallpaper is replaced by the Home 
screen or whatever app you were last running.
To set the wallpaper, choose Settings➪General➪Wallpaper from the Home 
screen. You can then choose from among stylish built-in wallpaper images by 
tapping the Wallpaper button. 
 
You can also choose from the entire photo library on your iPod touch by 
tapping Photo Library, or you can choose saved photos by tapping Saved 
Photos. (For more about photos, see Chapter 9.) 
Tap a thumbnail to select the image for your wallpaper or tap the Wallpaper 
button in the upper-left corner to return to the Wallpaper menu. After tap-
ping an image, your iPod touch displays the Move and Scale screen, which 
lets you optionally pan the image by dragging your finger, and optionally 
zoom in or out of the image by pinching and unpinching with your fingers. 
Tap the Set Wallpaper button to set the image as your wallpaper or tap 
Cancel to cancel.

43
 Chapter 3: Clocking, Locking, and Personalizing
Sound effects
Don’t want to hear the keyboard click as you type, or the snap noise as you 
swipe your finger over the “unlock” message? You can set which events can 
trigger sound effects as well as the volume of the sound effect. 
Choose Settings➪General➪Sounds from the Home screen. You can then turn 
the alert on or off and click sounds for new mail, sent mail, calendar alerts, 
locking and unlocking, and using the onscreen keyboard. Tap On to turn off 
each option, or vice versa.
Location, location, location
Perhaps nothing is more personal than your physical location. Your iPod 
touch can triangulate its location with scary precision, even though it has 
neither a cell phone nor the location-determining technology known as GPS. 
(The iPod touch’s cousin, the iPhone, does have both a cell phone and GPS.) 
The iPod touch does this by leveraging the most extensive Wi-Fi reference 
database in the world.
Why should you care? The Maps app can find your location on the map, 
which is very useful for getting directions (see Chapter 12). Other apps (such 
as Showtimes, Eventful, WhosHere, and various travel apps) can grab this 
physical location information and use it to help you find things closer to you.
You can turn Location Services on or off by choosing Settings➪General from 
the Home screen and then tapping the Off button for Location Services to 
turn it on, or the On button to turn it off.
After turning it off, your iPod touch prompts you to turn it back on if you run 
an app that makes use of Location Services (such as Maps). 
 
To conserve battery power, turn off Location Services if you aren’t using 
applications that make use of it. 
Setting restrictions
If you need to, you can set restrictions that 
 
✓ Prevent access to explicit music, podcasts, and videos according 
to ratings.
 
✓ Prevent the use of apps such as YouTube.
 
✓ Disallow in-app purchases.
 
✓ Stop any access to the iTunes Store or App Store. 

44
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Choose Settings➪General from the Home screen and then tap Restrictions to 
see the Restrictions screen. Tap Enable Restrictions and then set up a restric-
tions passcode (which is separate from your Passcode Lock passcode). Enter 
a four-number passcode by touching numbers in the calculator-style keypad. 
If you change your mind, tap the Cancel button to cancel the operation. Then 
enter the same passcode number again to confirm the passcode, and the 
Restrictions are enabled and appear ready for you to change.
Set the restrictions you want by tapping each control’s On switch to turn 
it off. By default, all controls are on, which means usage is allowed (not 
restricted). Turn off a control to restrict its use.
To turn off all restrictions, choose Settings➪General➪Restrictions and then 
enter the passcode. Tap Disable Restrictions and then reenter the passcode. 
Your iPod touch is now free. Be careful out there!

T
his part shows you how to ﬁ ll up your iPod 
touch with extreme content and killer apps. 
First, in Chapter 4, you ﬁ nd out all about iTunes 
and how to set yourself up with an iTunes Store 
account. You’re then given free reign to browse 
the store online from iTunes or browse for tunes 
and apps directly from your iPod touch. You also 
ﬁ nd out how to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
Next, in Chapter 5, I show you how to synchronize 
your iPod touch with your iTunes library, which 
you can ﬁ ll up with songs from audio CDs and 
other content and apps from the iTunes Store. 
You can match your iPod touch library song for 
song with your iTunes library, or you can be more 
selective about what you copy to your iPod touch. 
You can also make sure your iPod touch down-
loads, including apps, are backed up in your 
iTunes library.
Then, in Chapter 6, I show you how to organize 
and synchronize your personal information with 
your iPod touch — your contacts, calendars, Web 
bookmarks, and e-mail accounts. 
After all that, your iPod touch should be ﬁ lled to 
the brim!

f the iPod touch were a spaceship, iTunes would be the space station it 
docks with to get its supplies. iTunes is the central repository 
of all content and iPod touch apps, and it’s the gateway to the 
online iTunes Store and App Store from your computer.
The iTunes Store offers millions of songs, with most 
songs available for download for 99 cents each and 
entire albums available for download at less than 
the list price of a CD. You can also buy audio books, 
TV episodes, and first-run movies. On top of that, 
iTunes offers tons of free content in the form of 
podcasts, which are similar to syndicated radio 
and TV shows. You can download podcasts into 
iTunes and play them at your convenience on your 
computer and on your iPod touch. iTunes even offers 
free lectures, language lessons, and audio books with 
educational content in its iTunes U section.
The iTunes Store includes the App Store, which offers free and 
commercial iPod touch applications by the tens of thousands. You 
can find apps in just about every category you can think of, including gaming, 
social networking, sports, business, and more. And after you’ve organized 
your content and apps in your iTunes library, you can put them on your iPod 
touch to carry around with you.

48
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
You can also download free or commercial content and apps directly from 
your iPod touch. The music and podcast sections of iTunes Store and the 
entire App Store are available right at your fingertips. You can download 
items and then synchronize them with your iTunes library. 
This chapter gives you an overview of what you can do with iTunes, and it 
shows you how to sign in and take advantage of what the iTunes Store and 
App Store have to offer.
Discovering What You Can Do with iTunes
iTunes is the software that manages content on my iPod touch, all my other 
iPods, my iPhone, and even my Apple TV. Whether I buy content through 
my iPod touch, my iPhone, or my computer running iTunes, it all ends up 
in my iTunes library on my computer. I also bring content into iTunes from 
CDs and downloaded MP3 files. I then parcel the content out to various 
devices for playback. 
All my content is stored in my main iTunes library on my computer, and 
backed up to another hard drive and to DVDs and CDs. You can manage all 
these activities with iTunes.
You can add videos to your iTunes library in a couple of ways: by choosing 
content from the iTunes Store (such as TV shows, feature-length high-
definition movies, music videos, and even free movie trailers) or by down-
loading standard video files in the MPEG-4 format from other sources on 
the Internet. You can also create your own videos with a digital camcorder 
(or cameras built into computers, such as the iSight camera included with 
MacBooks and iMacs) and copy them to iTunes. 
 
Although you can’t use iTunes to transfer video content from a DVD, you can 
use other software to convert DVDs to digital video files, and you can transfer 
video content from older VHS players by using a digital video camcorder. 
Visit my Tony’s Tips site at www.tonybove.com/tonytips for more details.
As if that weren’t enough, iTunes gives you the power to organize content 
into playlists. A playlist is a list of the items that you want in the sequence 
that you want to play them. For example, you can make a playlist of love 
songs from different albums to play the next time you need a romantic mood, 
or you can compile a playlist of surf songs for a trip to the beach. You can 
even combine videos and music in a playlist. 

49
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
 
If you organize songs into playlists in iTunes, you can then easily synchronize 
those playlists with your iPod touch to be more selective about the music 
you copy. See Chapter 5 for sync details. (Also, see my other book, iPod & 
iTunes For Dummies, to find out all about iTunes.)
What’s that you say? You’re still not satisfied with what iTunes can do for you? 
Well, iTunes also has a built-in equalizer with preset settings for all kinds of 
music and listening environments, with the added bonus of being able to cus-
tomize and save your own personalized settings with each item of content.
You can run iTunes anytime (with or without your iPod touch attached to your 
computer) to build and manage your library. You don’t have to connect your 
iPod touch until you’re ready to sync it (as I describe in Chapter 5).
Browsing your iTunes library
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes look nearly identical and offer the 
same functions and viewing options, including the cover browser (also known 
as Cover Flow). Figure 4-1 shows the iTunes window on the Mac with the 
cover browser open, displaying the cover art for albums.
iTunes offers a view of your library and your sources for content, as well as 
controls for organizing, importing, and playing content, as follows:
 
✓ Source pane: Displays the source of content, handily divided into the 
following sections:
 
• Library: Includes your music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, audio 
books, applications and games, ringtones, and all available radio 
stations.
 
• Store: Includes the iTunes Store, your shopping cart (if you turned 
on the Shopping Cart option in your Preferences, as described 
later in this chapter), and your Purchased list.
 
• Devices: Includes audio CDs and any iPods, iPhones, and Apple TV 
devices (such as TB’s Apple TV in Figure 4-1; TB being my initials) 
that are connected to your computer.
 
• Playlists: Includes iTunes DJ and your playlists.
 
✓ Cover browser: Also called Cover Flow, the cover browser lets you flip 
through your cover art to choose songs. You can use the slider to move 
swiftly through your library, or you can click to the right or left of the 
cover in the foreground to move forward or backward in your library.

50
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
✓ List pane: Depending on the source that’s selected in the Source pane, 
the List pane displays a list of items.
 
✓ Player buttons — Forward/Next, Play/Pause, and Previous/Rewind: 
Use these buttons to control the playback of content in iTunes.
 
✓ Volume control: You can change the volume level in iTunes by dragging 
the volume control slider in the upper-left section of the iTunes window 
to the right to increase the volume, or to the left to decrease it. 
 
✓ Status pane: When content is playing, you can see the artist name, piece 
title (if known), and the elapsed time displayed in this pane.
 
✓ View buttons: The three buttons in the upper-right corner change your 
view of the List pane to show items in a list, show cover art thumbnail 
images in a grid, or show the cover browser.
 
✓ Search field: Type in this field to search your library. You can also use 
the Search field to peruse a playlist or to look within the iTunes Store.
 
✓ Playlist buttons — Add, Shuffle, Repeat: Use these buttons to add play-
lists and shuffle or repeat playback of playlists.
 
✓ Show/Hide Artwork button: Use this button to display or hide artwork 
associated with your music or videos (either your own or the artwork 
supplied by the iTunes Store).
 
✓ Speakers pop-up menu: Use this pop-up menu in the lower-right 
corner of the iTunes window to select a different speaker system 
than the computer’s speakers. This pop-up menu appears only if you 
choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or the Edit menu 
in Windows), click the Devices tab, and turn on the Look for Remote 
Speakers Connected with AirTunes option. If iTunes locates remote 
speakers connected to an Airport Express or Apple TV using AirTunes 
(the technology for streaming music over a Wi-Fi or Ethernet local area 
network), the pop-up menu appears.
 
✓ Genius button: The Genius button, located in the lower-right corner of 
the iTunes window to the left of the Show/Hide Genius Sidebar button, 
generates a playlist of songs from your library that go great with the 
song you selected. The Genius button appears only when you’ve 
selected music, movies, TV shows, or a playlist. (See Chapter 7 for 
details about creating Genius playlists.)
 
✓ Show/Hide Genius Sidebar button: Use this button to display or hide 
the Genius sidebar. The Genius sidebar makes suggestions for what to 
get from the iTunes Store based on what you’ve selected. 
 
✓ Eject button: This button appears next to the name of an audio CD or 
iPod touch in the Source pane to eject the CD or iPod touch. Clicking 
the Eject button for a CD physically ejects the CD so that it pops out. 
Clicking Eject for an iPod touch removes (unmounts) the iPod touch 
from the system so that you can disconnect it.

Setting up an iTunes Store account
One important task that you must do is set up your iTunes Store account. You 
can set it up in iTunes on your computer, or directly on your iPod touch (as I 
describe in “Shopping with Your iPod touch,” later in this chapter). You need 
an account to purchase content or apps on your computer as well as to use the 
iTunes Store and App Store apps on your iPod touch. You can create as many 
accounts as you need — perhaps one for each family member. To create an 
iTunes Store account using iTunes on your computer, follow these steps:

52
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
1. In iTunes, click the iTunes Store option in the Store section of the 
Source pane.
 
 The iTunes Store home page appears, as shown in Figure 4-2, replacing 
the List pane.
 
2. Click the Sign In button in the upper-right area of the window (refer 
to Figure 4-2) to either create an account or sign in to an existing 
account.
 
 When you’re logged in to an iTunes account, the account name appears 
in place of the Sign In button.
 
 After you click the Sign In button, iTunes displays the account sign-in 
dialog.
 
 If you already set up an account with the iTunes Store with the MobileMe 
(formerly .Mac) service or with other Apple services (such as the Apple 
Developer Connection), you’re halfway there. Type your ID and password 
and then click the Sign In button. Apple remembers the personal informa-
tion that you put in previously, so you don’t have to re-enter it every time 
you visit the iTunes Store. If you forgot your password, click the Forgot 
Password? button, and iTunes provides a dialog so that you can answer 
your test question. If you answer correctly, iTunes e-mails your password 
to you.
 
3. Click the Create New Account button.
 
 iTunes displays a new page that welcomes you to the iTunes Store.
 
4. Click Continue on the iTunes Store welcome page.
 
 After you click Continue, the terms of use appear with the option at the 
end to agree to the terms. If you don’t select the option to agree, the 
iTunes continues to display the terms until you agree or click Cancel.
 
5. Select the I Have Read and Agree to the iTunes Terms and Conditions 
option to agree with the legal terms. Then click Continue. 
 
 iTunes displays the next page of the setup procedure.
 
6. Fill in your personal account information.
 
 You need to enter your e-mail address, password, test question and 
answer (in case you forget your password), birthdate, and privacy 
options. Don’t forget your password — you need it to access the store 
from your iPod touch.
 
7. Click the Continue button to go to the next page of the account setup 
procedure and then enter your credit card information.
 
 The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The iTunes 
Store keeps your personal information (including your credit card infor-
mation) on file, and you don’t have to type it again.

53
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
 
8. Click Continue to finish the procedure.
 
 The account setup finishes and returns you to the iTunes Store home 
page. You can now use the iTunes Store to purchase and download con-
tent to play in iTunes and use on any iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.

Shopping at the iTunes Store
If you have an iTunes Store account set up (see the previous section), you 
can buy and download content immediately, including movies for rent. I 
don’t know of a faster way to purchase or rent content from the comfort of 
your home.
If you already have your iTunes program open, click iTunes Store in the Store 
section of the Source pane. The iTunes Store home page opens (refer to 
Figure 4-2). 

54
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Cruising in the multimedia mall
The iTunes Store home page is loaded with specials and advertisements to 
peruse. To look at music in more depth, choose Music from the iTunes Store 
panel at the top left of the home page (next to the New and Noteworthy 
panel — refer to Figure 4-2). iTunes displays more panels of advertisements 
and specials for music lovers. You can then choose a genre from the Genres 
pop-up menu on the iTunes Store panel to see only those specials and ads for 
a particular genre.
The iTunes Store also provides buttons on a gray bar just above the adver-
tised content in the List pane (refer to Figure 4-2). The left and right triangle 
buttons work just like the Back and Forward buttons of a Web browser, 
moving back a page or forward a page, respectively. The button with the 
Home icon takes you to the iTunes Store home page. 
After selecting an advertisement for an album, for example, the album’s 
page appears with a description and other links, as shown in Figure 4-3. The 
iTunes Store uses the iTunes List pane to display the contents of the album.
 
 
Figure 4-3: You can view an album’s songs in the iTunes Store.

55
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
 
You can preview any song in the iTunes Store for up to 30 seconds. Some 
movies offer one-minute previews and movie trailers you can view for free, 
and TV shows and audio books can offer up to 90 seconds. To preview a 
song, TV show, movie, or music video, click the title in the list and then click 
the Play button (or press the spacebar). 
Videos play in the Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of the iTunes 
window, as shown in Figure 4-4. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, click the 
Show/Hide Artwork button to display it. Click the iTunes player buttons to 
control playback, and use the iTunes volume slider to control the volume.

Buying and downloading items
The iTunes Store thoughtfully gives you two different methods for purchas-
ing and downloading items, and you’re free to switch between methods at 
your leisure. The two methods are

56
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
✓ 1-Click: 1-Click shopping is the default method. Whenever you’re ready, 
you can purchase a song or any other item and download it to your com-
puter. All you need to do is click the Buy button, whether the item is a 
song, an album, a TV show episode, or an audio book. 
 
 For example, if you select a song in the List pane, click the Buy Song 
button in the far-right column for the song (refer to Figure 4-3). (You 
might have to scroll your iTunes Store window to see the far-right 
column.) When you select a TV show episode, click the Buy Episode 
button in the far-right column (refer to Figure 4-4). You can also click the 
Buy Album button in an album advertisement. 
 
✓ Shopping Cart: Alternatively, you can gather your selections in a 
virtual shopping cart first to see your choices and decide whether to 
purchase them before downloading them all at once. With the shop-
ping cart, the iTunes Store remembers your selections, allowing you 
to browse the iTunes Store at different times and add to your total 
without making any purchases final. You can also remove items from 
the cart at any time. When you’re ready to buy, you can purchase and 
download the items in your cart in one fell swoop.
To change your shopping method, choose iTunes➪Preferences on the Mac 
or Edit➪Preferences in Windows. In the Preferences window, click the Store 
button. Select the Shopping Cart option. 
 
Wait — before you close the Store Preferences window and run off to buy 
stuff, take note of some cool features: This window lets you set the option to 
automatically check for available downloads from the iTunes Store — such as 
downloads that were not completed — and new episodes for a podcast sub-
scription. You can even set options to automatically download pre-purchased 
or Season Pass content as well as missing album artwork.
After switching to the Shopping Cart method and closing the Store 
Preferences window, the Buy button changes to an Add button — as in Add 
Song, Add Album, Add Episode, and so on. After adding items, you can view 
the selections in your shopping cart by going to the Source pane and select-
ing the Shopping Cart option underneath the iTunes Store option in the Store 
section. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)
The shopping cart appears in the List view with your selections listed, and 
recommendations from the iTunes Store appear along the top of the window. 
Albums appear with a triangle next to their names, which you can click to 
open in order to see the album’s songs. When you’re ready to purchase 
everything in your shopping cart, click the BUY NOW button in the lower-
right corner of the Shopping Cart view to close the sale and download all the 
items at once. Alternatively, you can click the Buy (for an album) or Buy Song 
buttons for each item that you want to purchase.

57
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
The iTunes Store may prompt you to log in to your account after you click 
the Buy button (unless you just recently logged in). It then displays a warn-
ing dialog to make sure that you want to buy the item (or items, if you’re 
using a shopping cart), and you can then go through with it by clicking the 
Buy button, or cancel. After you click the Buy button, iTunes downloads the 
item or items and, after downloading, they appear in your iTunes library. 
The iTunes Store keeps track of your purchases over a 24-hour period and 
charges you for a total sum rather than for each single purchase.
To delete items from your shopping cart, select them and press Delete/
Backspace. A warning appears, asking whether you’re sure that you want to 
remove the selected items. Click Yes to go ahead and remove the selections 
from your shopping cart.
You can see the list of all the items that you purchased (no matter which 
shopping method you used at the time) by selecting the Purchased playlist 
under the iTunes Store option in the Source pane. The List view and Browse 
view change to show the items you purchased.
 
If you use more than one computer to access your iTunes Store account, you 
can set the preferences for each computer differently and still use the same 
account. For example, your home computer might have a faster connection 
than your laptop on a remote connection, so you can set your iTunes prefer-
ences accordingly: The home computer could be set to 1-Click, and the 
laptop could be set to shopping cart.
 
Each time you buy content, you get an e-mail from the iTunes Store with the 
purchase information. It’s nice to know right away what you bought.
Appearing at the App Store
You can get loads of free and commercial apps that run on your iPod touch 
just like the built-in apps such as Map and Weather. (To no one’s big surprise, 
many of the apps are games.) To find thousands of apps, click App Store in 
the iTunes Store panel on the iTunes Store home page (refer to Figure 4-2). 
The App Store page appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
Click an app’s icon to go to the information page for that app, which may also 
contain reviews and a slideshow depicting the app in all its glory. The infor-
mation page offers the Buy App button (to purchase and download a com-
mercial app), or the Get App button (to download a free app). Click the Buy 
App or Get App button to download the app to your iTunes library.
Downloaded apps appear in the Applications section of your iTunes library 
(refer to Figure 4-1) — click Applications in the Library section of the Source 
pane to see their icons. If you don’t see Applications in the Source pane, 

58
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click 
the General tab at the top of the Preferences window, select the Applications 
option from the list of options for the Show heading, and click OK. The 
Applications option then appears in the Source pane in the Library section.
 
 
Figure 4-5: iPod touch apps in the App Store section of the iTunes Store.
When an app you downloaded is updated, iTunes informs you — the message 
Update Available appears at the bottom of the Applications section with an 
arrow link that takes you to the My Apps Update page in the iTunes Store, 
with icons of the apps to update. Click the Get Update button next to each 
app to download the update, which automatically replaces the previous ver-
sion of the app.
Going Online with Your iPod touch
To use the iTunes Store and App Store on your iPod touch, you must first 
join a Wi-Fi network that’s connected to the Internet. The iPod touch can 
join Wi-Fi networks at home, at work, or at Wi-Fi hotspots around the world. 
Although some public Wi-Fi networks are free, others require logging in first, 

59
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
and still others require logging in and supplying a credit card number. Still 
others are detected but locked — if you select a locked network, a dialog 
appears asking for a password.
If you don’t have Wi-Fi at home but you do have a broadband Internet 
connection (such as cable or DSL), I recommend buying an AirPort Express 
or AirPort Extreme, available in the Apple Store — you can then connect 
your Internet connection to the AirPort to extend Internet access over Wi-Fi. 
AirPort Express is powerful enough to run a home Wi-Fi network yet por-
table enough to take on the road and use in hotel rooms that offer Internet 
connections, and it even plays music from your iTunes library through 
speakers connected to it. AirPort Extreme lets up to 50 users connect to 
Wi-Fi at once — perfect for a large family or small business. You can give 
your network a unique name, which appears in the list of networks on your 
iPod touch when your iPod touch is in range of it.
Turning Wi-Fi on or off
To turn Wi-Fi on, choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from the Home screen to display the 
Wi-Fi Networks screen, and tap the Off button for the Wi-Fi setting to turn it 
on (tap it again to turn it off). 
When Wi-Fi is turned on, your iPod 
touch detects and automatically 
acquires a Wi-Fi signal you’ve used 
before, or it can detect one or more 
signals in the area and present them 
in a list for you to choose. The list 
of available Wi-Fi networks appears 
below the Wi-Fi setting, as shown in 
Figure 4-6. 
 
If your iPod touch isn’t already con-
nected to Wi-Fi, it’s set by default to 
look for networks and ask whether 
you want to join them whenever you 
use something that requires the net-
work (such as Safari, Weather, 
YouTube, Mail, and so on). You can 
stop your iPod touch from looking 
and asking: Scroll down to the end of 
the list of Wi-Fi networks on the Wi-Fi 
Networks screen and then tap the On 
button for the Ask to Join Networks 
option to turn it off. You can still join 
networks manually, but you won’t 
be interrupted with requests to join 
networks.
Figure 4-6: Enable Wi-Fi and then choose a 
Wi-Fi network.

60
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Choosing a Wi-Fi network
You can scroll the list of networks in the Wi-Fi Networks screen to choose 
one. (Refer to Figure 4-6.) You can scroll quickly by flicking your finger or 
scroll slowly by dragging up or down, but however you scroll, you choose a 
Wi-Fi network by tapping its name. Networks are named by their administra-
tors. (If you set up your own home Wi-Fi, you get to name yours whatever 
you want.)
 
When connected to a Wi-Fi network, your iPod touch displays the Wi-Fi icon 
in the status bar at the top of the display, which also indicates the connec-
tion strength — the more bars you see, the stronger the connection.
If a Lock icon appears next to the Wi-Fi network name (refer to Figure 4-6), 
it means the network is locked and you need a password. When you select a 
locked network, the iPod touch displays an Enter Password screen and the 
onscreen keyboard. Tap out the password using the keyboard. (For details 
on how to use the onscreen keyboard, see Chapter 2.) Tap Join to join the 
network or tap Cancel in the upper-right corner to cancel joining.
 
To join a Wi-Fi network that requires either a credit card or an account for 
you to log in, select the network and then use Safari to open the network’s 
Web page. (For more on using Safari, see Chapter 10.) The first Web page 
you see is typically the log-in page for the service (for example, a commercial 
Wi-Fi service or a hotel service). 
Your iPod touch remembers your Wi-Fi connections and automatically uses 
one when it detects it within your range. If you’ve used multiple Wi-Fi net-
works in the same location, it picks the last one you used.
 
You can also forget a network — such as a paid or closed Wi-Fi service that 
somehow got hold of your iPod touch and won’t let you move on to other 
Web pages without typing a password. See Chapter 15 for the details about 
how to forget a network.
Shopping with Your iPod touch
The music, movies, TV shows, music videos, podcasts, and audiobooks in the 
iTunes store as well as the entire App Store, are available right at your finger-
tips on your iPod touch. You can search for, browse, and preview content; 
make purchases; and download content directly to your iPod touch. 
Whatever you buy on your iPod touch is automatically copied to your iTunes 
library the next time you synchronize it with your computer, as I describe in 
Chapter 5.

61
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
Be sure to set up an iTunes Store account first if you don’t already have one, 
as I describe earlier in this chapter — and you’ll need to remember your 
password. To download content and apps directly to your iPod touch, you 
can set up your iPod touch with iTunes, which basically means signing in to 
your iTunes Store account in iTunes on your computer, and then syncing 
your iPod touch to iTunes as I describe in Chapter 5. After doing that once, 
you shouldn’t have to bother with it again, and you’ll be able to download 
items from the iTunes Store and App Store on your iPod touch from then on. 
All you need to do is enter the password for your iTunes Store account when 
prompted.
You can also set up one or more iTunes Store accounts directly from your 
iPod touch: choose Settings➪Store from the Home screen and then tap 
Create New Account. Confirm your country or region and touch Next. Tap 
Agree to the terms of service, and then enter the information on the New 
Account screen with the onscreen keyboard. (The information you need to 
supply is the same as shown in “Setting up an iTunes Store account,” earlier 
in this chapter.) Tap Next to continue through the setup screens to finish set-
ting up your account.
 
To sign into an existing account, choose Settings➪Store and then tap Sign In. 
You can then type in your account 
name and password. You can also 
view your account information at 
any time by choosing Settings➪Store 
and tapping View Account.
Browsing and 
downloading content
To go to the iTunes Store on an 
iPod touch, tap the iTunes icon on 
the Home screen. The store screen 
appears with Music, Videos, Podcast, 
Search, and More icons along the 
bottom. Here’s the lowdown on 
the icons.
 
✓ Tap the Music icon to see Music 
items, new releases, and store 
recommendations, as shown in 
Figure 4-7. The screen displays 
New Releases, Top Tens, and 
Genres buttons along the top. 
To search through genres, tap 
the Genres button and choose a 
genre. Tap the Top Tens button 
Figure 4-7: You can browse the iTunes Store 
on an iPod touch.

62
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
to see a list of the top ten choices in different genres. Choose iTunes in 
the Top Tens list to see the top ten songs throughout the iTunes Store. 
Tap Music in the top-left corner to return to the previous Music screen.
 
✓ Tap the Videos icon and the screen displays Movies, TV Shows, and 
Music Videos buttons along the top. Tap Movies to see new movie 
releases; TV Shows to see new and noteworthy TV shows; or Music 
Videos to see the hottest music videos in the iTunes Store. Tap Videos 
in the top-left corner to return to the previous Videos screen.
 
✓ Tap the Podcasts icon and the screen displays What’s Hot, Top Tens, 
and Categories buttons along the top. Tap What’s Hot to see the most 
popular podcasts; Categories to view categories of podcasts; or Top 
Tens to see the top ten in each category. Tap Podcasts in the top-left 
corner to return to the previous Podcasts screen.
 
✓ Tap the Search icon to search the store and then tap the entry field 
to bring up the onscreen keyboard. Type the search term and tap the 
Search button to search the store. 
 
✓ Tap the More icon and then either select Audiobooks to buy audio 
books, iTunes U to download learning content, Downloads to see the 
progress of your downloads from the store, or Redeem to redeem gift 
certificates.
If this is your first time to the store on your iPod touch, the Music section 
appears with New Releases in a scrollable list. Tap any song to hear a pre-
view. To buy and download a song, tap the button with the price tag. Enter 
your password and tap OK. 
You can similarly preview and buy videos — tap the video, then tap the 
Preview button to see a preview, and tap the Buy (with price tag) button to 
buy it and download it.
After selecting a podcast, a list of episodes appears. Tap the Free button (or 
Buy button for paid podcasts) next to an episode, enter your password, and 
then tap OK to start downloading the podcast episode. 
Purchased and downloaded items are added to a Purchased playlist on your 
iPod touch, and they’re included in your Purchased playlist in iTunes as well 
as in a special Purchased on YourDeviceName playlist. iTunes automatically 
syncs items downloaded on your iPod touch to your iTunes library when you 
connect it to your computer so that you have a backup if you delete them 
from the iPod touch. 
Some albums offer bonus content, such as liner notes, which are downloaded 
to your iTunes library on your computer, but not to your iPod touch. Also 
note that an alert appears on your iPod touch if you’ve previously purchased 
one or more songs from an album. Tap Buy if you want to purchase the entire 
album, or tap Cancel if you want to buy the remaining songs on the album 
individually.

63
 Chapter 4: Exploring iTunes and the Online Store
 
If you lose your network connection or turn off your iPod touch while down-
loading, the download pauses and then resumes when you reestablish Wi-Fi. 
If you go back to your computer, iTunes can complete the download opera-
tion to your iTunes library. To make sure you received all your downloads 
from purchases on your iPod touch, use iTunes on your computer and 
choose Store➪Check for Available Downloads.
Browsing and downloading apps
To use the App Store, tap the App Store icon on the Home screen. The Store 
screen appears with Featured, Categories, Top 25, Search, and More icons 
along the bottom. The following list tells you what’s what when it comes to 
the icons:
 
✓ Tap the Featured icon and then 
tap the What’s Hot button at 
the top to see the most popu-
lar apps based on downloads, 
or tap the New button to see 
featured new apps, as shown in 
Figure 4-8.
 
✓ To browse by category, tap the 
Categories icon in the bottom 
menu and then tap a category, 
such as Games, to see a list of 
all games by popularity.
 
✓ Tap the Top 25 icon in the 
bottom menu and then tap Top 
Paid to see the top 25 paid apps 
by popularity, or tap Top Free 
to see the top 25 free apps.
 
✓ Tap the Search icon to search 
the store, and tap the entry 
field to bring up the onscreen 
keyboard. Type the search term 
and tap Search to search the 
store. Suggestions pop up right 
away; for example, if you search 
for “Tony” in the App Store, my 
app, Tony’s Tips for iPhone 
Users Manual, appears in the list of suggestions.
 
✓ Tap the More icon to select Redeem to redeem gift certificates, or 
Updates to . . . er, I explain that one in the next section.

the App Store on an iPod touch.

64
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
To view information and to purchase and download an app, tap the app in 
the list that appears after tapping the Featured, Categories, Top 25, or Search 
icon. You can then scroll the display to see more information about the app.
To download an app, tap the Price button (for a paid app) or Free button (for 
a free app). The Price or Free button changes to the Install button. Tap Install 
and then enter your password and tap OK.
The iPod touch displays the Home screen with the icon for the new app as it 
loads. As soon as the Loading message is replaced by the name of the app, 
the icon is ready to be tapped.
Updating apps you’ve downloaded
The App Store on your iPod touch notifies you if any of your apps have been 
updated — a number appears in the App Store icon. You should update an 
app when an update is available because updates fix bugs and introduce new 
features you may want. 
Tap the More icon at the bottom-right corner of the App Store screen and 
then tap Updates to see the list of updated apps. To update an app, tap the 
app in the list to see the app’s information screen and then tap the Update 
button. The Update button changes to the Install button. Tap Install and then 
enter your password and tap OK.
The update replaces the previous version of the app as it loads into your 
iPod touch. As soon as the Loading message is replaced by the name of the 
app, the icon is ready to be tapped. 
Now you’re ready to sync with your iTunes library the apps and content you 
downloaded into your iPod touch — sink gently into the next chapter.

Into the Sync with iTunes
In This Chapter
▶ Synchronizing your iPod touch with your iTunes Store account
▶ Synchronizing your iTunes library with your iPod touch
▶ Copying songs and videos directly to, or deleting them from, your iPod touch
S
ynchronizing your iPod touch with iTunes means keeping it up-to-date 
with your iTunes library — matching it song for song, movie for movie, 
and so on. The sync operation also keeps both your iPod touch and your 
computer up-to-date with your iTunes Store account information as well as 
with items downloaded from the iTunes Store or App Store directly to your 
iPod touch.
If you make changes in iTunes after syncing the iPod touch, 
those changes are automatically made in the iPod touch 
when you sync again. Your iPod touch mirrors as much 
of the content of your iTunes library as will fit, making 
assumptions if the entire library won’t fit. 
The full, everything-but-the-kitchen-sync approach 
works well if your combined iTunes library and 
photo library are small enough to fit in their 
entirety on your iPod touch. For example, if your 
iTunes and photo libraries combined are less than 
29GB and you have a 32GB iPod touch, sync every-
thing. (You can see the size of your iTunes library in 
GB, or gigabytes, at the bottom of the iTunes window 
in the center.) Syncing everything copies your entire 
library, and it’s just as fast as copying individual items 
(if not faster) because you don’t have to select the items 
to copy.

66
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
If your libraries are larger than your iPod touch, you can make decisions 
about which parts to sync. You can select options to synchronize music, 
TV shows, movies, and so on. For example, you can copy all your songs and 
audio books, but only some of your TV shows, none of your movies, and only 
the podcasts you haven’t heard yet.
This chapter also describes how to copy songs, videos, podcasts, and audio 
books directly to your iPod touch using the manual method. You can even 
combine automatic syncing with manual methods to build your iPod touch 
library as you see fit.
Syncing with Your iTunes Library and Account
It’s easy to sync your iPod touch with your computer so you can copy 
content and apps to the iPod touch from your iTunes library. It’s also 
necessary for copying any iPod touch purchases or downloads back to your 
computer for safekeeping. Syncing also makes sure that your iPod touch 
is set with your iTunes Store account information if you haven’t set the 
account up by hand with your iPod touch (as I describe in Chapter 4.) To 
make sure your iPod touch is set with your iTunes Store account information, 
sign in first to the iTunes Store, and then sync your iPod touch. 
After syncing your iPod touch, iTunes copies anything you downloaded to 
your iPod touch back to your iTunes library — that way you don’t lose any 
media if, heaven forbid, something happens to your iPod touch.
Follow these steps to sync your iPod touch with iTunes:
 
1. With iTunes running, visit the iTunes Store and sign in to your 
account.
 
 You don’t have to buy anything; just signing into the store provides 
all the info you need to sync your iPod touch with the iTunes Store 
account. (If you haven’t set up your iTunes Store account yet, flip back 
to Chapter 4, do the deed, and then sign in by clicking the Sign In button 
in the upper-right area of the iTunes window.) When you’re signed in to 
an iTunes Store account, the account name appears in place of the Sign 
In button. 
 
2. Connect the iPod touch and select its name when it appears in the 
Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the iPod touch sync options to the right of the Source 
pane, with the Summary page (under the Summary tab) open. The 
Summary page shows how much space on the device is occupied by 
content and how much is still free. (See Figure 5-1.) 

67
 Chapter 5: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
Figure 5-1: The iPod touch Summary page in iTunes offers sync options.
 
3. If the iPod touch isn’t automatically synchronizing, click the Sync 
button in the bottom-right corner to synchronize it.
 
 You can select the content you want to synchronize, as I describe later 
in this chapter, or sync with whatever selections you’ve already made 
and change them later when you re-sync. 
 
 After clicking the Sync button, the iTunes Status pane tells you that 
iTunes is syncing the iPod touch. 
 
4. Wait for the synchronization to finish and then click the Eject button 
next to the iPod touch name in the Source pane.
 
 You should always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) dis-
plays that the synchronization is complete.
 
5. Disconnect your iPod touch from your computer.
 
 That’s it. Your iPod touch is now synchronized.

68
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Copying Everything
After connecting the iPod touch to iTunes, you can copy everything at once 
by following Steps 2–5 in the previous section (refer to Figure 5-1). Most likely 
your iPod touch is already set to automatically synchronize with iTunes after 
connecting it. If you haven’t made any sync selections, the default is to copy 
everything in your iTunes library to your iPod touch.
 
Photos you’ve organized in an iPhoto library (on a Mac) or in a program 
(such as Adobe Photoshop Album in Windows) are also copied over. See 
Chapter 9 for details.
If your iTunes library is too large to fit on your iPod touch, iTunes decides 
which songs and albums to include by using the ratings that you set for each 
song. (To find out how to set ratings, see Chapter 15.) If your iPod touch 
already has photos on it, iTunes asks whether you want to delete them to 
gain more space. After clicking Yes or No, iTunes tries its best to fit every-
thing. If it has to cut something, though, it skips copying new photos and 
displays the message Some photos were not copied.
If you’re still short of space even after skipping photos, iTunes displays a 
warning about the lack of free space, and it asks whether you want to disable 
podcast synchronization and let iTunes create a selection of songs in a play-
list based on ratings and playback counts in iTunes. (A playlist is a list of the 
items that you want in the sequence that you want to play them — you can 
use playlists to organize your music playback experience.)
 
✓ If you click Yes, iTunes creates a new playlist (titled “Your device name 
Selection,” as in “My iPod touch Selection”) and displays a message tell-
ing you so. Click OK, and iTunes synchronizes your iPod touch using 
the new playlist. iTunes also sets your iPod touch to synchronize music 
automatically by playlist, as I describe in the next section.
 
✓ If you click No, iTunes updates automatically until it fills your iPod 
touch without creating the playlist.
From that point on, your iPod touch synchronizes with your iTunes library 
automatically, right after you connect it to your computer. If you add or 
delete content in your iTunes library, that content is added or deleted in the 
iPod touch when you sync again.
 
By the way, to find out more about creating playlists, consult iPod & iTunes 
For Dummies by yours truly (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
During the synchronization process, iTunes also performs a backup of the 
sync settings and other settings for your iPod touch from the last time when 
you synchronized it.

69
 Chapter 5: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
To prevent an iPod touch from automatically synchronizing, press Ô-Option 
(Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) while you connect the device, and then keep 
pressing until the iPod touch name appears in the iTunes Source pane. You 
can then change the iPod touch sync setting to manually manage music and 
videos, as I describe later in this chapter.
 
If you connect an iPod touch previously linked to another computer to your 
computer, iTunes displays a message warning you that clicking Yes replaces 
the iPod touch content with the content from your computer’s library. If you 
don’t want to change the iPod’s content, click No. If you click Yes, iTunes 
erases the iPod touch and synchronizes it with your computer’s library. To 
avoid this warning, first set the iPod touch sync settings to manually manage 
music and videos. 
Choosing What to Sync
If you have a massive music library, one that would never fit on even the 
most capacious of iPod touches, you can go the selective route, choosing 
which content to automatically sync with your iTunes library. By synchroniz-
ing selectively, you can still make your iPod touch match at least a subset 
of your iTunes library. If you make changes to that subset in iTunes, those 
changes are automatically made in the device when you synchronize again.
Syncing everything but the kitchen
You can decide which items you don’t want to synchronize and simply not 
include them by first deselecting them one by one in your iTunes library. (If 
you have a large iTunes library, this may take some time — you may find it 
easier to synchronize by playlists, as I show you later in this section.)
By default, all content items are selected — a check mark appears in the 
check box next to the item. To deselect an item in your iTunes library, click 
the check box next to the item so that the check mark disappears. To rese-
lect an item, just click the check box again.
 
You can quickly select (or deselect) an entire album by showing the Browser 
(choose View➪Show Browser) and choosing the album in the far-right 
column of the Browser view, and then pressing Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) 
while selecting (or deselecting) a single song in the album in the List view 
below the Browser columns.
After you deselect the items you don’t want to transfer, connect your iPod 
touch to your computer and select its name when it appears in the Devices 
section of the Source pane (refer to Figure 5-1). Then select the Sync Only 
Checked Songs and Videos option. Click Apply and continue with Steps 3–5 in 
the earlier section, “Syncing with Your iTunes Store Account.”

70
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
iTunes restarts synchronization and deletes from the iPod touch any items in 
the library that are deselected, to save space, before adding back in the items 
in the iTunes library that are selected. That means the items you deselected 
are now gone from your iPod touch — replaced by whatever items were 
selected. Of course, the items are still in your iTunes library.
Getting picky about playlists
You can include just the items that are defined in playlists, including Genius 
playlists. Syncing by playlist is a great way of syncing vast amounts of music 
without syncing the entire library. 
 
To find out more about creating smart and Genius playlists, consult iPod & 
iTunes For Dummies by yours truly.
For example, you can create four playlists that contain all essential rock, folk, 
blues, and jazz albums, and then select all four, or just one, two, or three of 
these playlists to synchronize with your iPod touch. 
Before using this option, create the playlists in iTunes that you want to copy 
to your iPod touch. Connect your iPod touch to your computer, and select 
its name when it appears in the Devices section of the Source pane (refer to 
Figure 5-1). Then click the Music tab of the sync options. (You may have to 
click Apply first to apply the changes you made to other sync options pages.) 
The Music sync options page appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
To select all the music and audio books in your library, select the Sync Music 
option and then select the All Songs and Playlists option on the Music sync 
options page. 
To choose playlists, select the Sync Music and the Selected Playlists options, 
and from the list box, select each playlist that you want to synchronize with 
the iPod touch. You can scroll the list box to see all your playlists. In Figure 
5-2, I chose the My Top Rated playlist. 
Finally, click the Apply button to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically. 
iTunes copies only the music and audio books in these playlists. If you also 
select the Include Music Videos option on the Music sync options page (as I 
do in Figure 5-2), iTunes includes music videos listed in the playlists. You can 
also select the Include Voice Memos option to sync your voice memos from 
the Voice Memo app with your iTunes library. (See Chapter 13 for details on 
using voice memo)

 Chapter 5: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
If you select the Sync Only Checked Songs and Videos option on the 
Summary page of the iPod touch sync options (refer to Figure 5-1), only 
selected items are copied. iTunes ignores items that are not selected, even if 
they’re listed in the chosen playlists for synchronization.
 
 
Figure 5-2: Synchronize your iPod with only selected playlists.
Picking and choosing podcast episodes
You can get picky about which podcast episodes should be copied over 
during synchronization. The Podcasts tab of the sync pages for the iPod 
touch gives you options for choosing podcast episodes to include.
Connect your iPod touch to your computer, and select its name when it 
appears in the Devices section of the Source pane (refer to Figure 5-1). Then 
click the Podcasts tab. The Podcasts sync options page appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-3.

72
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
The Podcast sync options let you choose unplayed or recently added 
episodes. Select the Sync ____ Episodes Of check box and choose a modifier 
from the pop-up menu, such as All Unplayed episodes (as shown in Figure 
5-3). You can also choose to sync episodes from all or just selected podcasts. 
For example, in Figure 5-3, I’m synchronizing all unplayed episodes of the 
selected podcasts.
Finally, click the Apply button to apply changes and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically. 
Choosing movies and TV shows
Movies and TV shows take up a lot of space, so if you limit the movies and 
TV episodes you synchronize with your iPod touch, you gain extra space for 
more music, audio books, podcasts, and photos.
To get choosy about movies, connect your iPod touch to your computer 
and select its name when it appears in the Devices section of the Source 
pane (refer to Figure 5-1). Then click the Movies tab of the sync options. The 
Movies sync options page appears, as shown in Figure 5-4. 
Select the Sync Movies check box (as shown in Figure 5-4). You can then 
choose to sync all movies, unwatched movies, recently added movies, or spe-
cific movies (as I do in Figure 5-4). 
To pick only the TV episodes you want, click the TV Shows tab of the sync 
options. (You may have to click the Apply button first, to apply the changes 
you made to other sync options pages.) The TV Shows sync options page 
appears, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Select the Sync ____ Episodes Of option (as shown in Figure 5-5). You can 
then use the pop-up menu to choose All Unwatched episodes, as I do in 
Figure 5-5, or recently added episodes. You can also choose to sync all 
TV shows or only selected shows. For example, in Figure 5-5, I’m copying 
all unwatched episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series but no other TV 
shows.
Finally, click the Apply button to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.

Manually Managing Music and Videos
If your entire library is too big for your iPod touch, you may want to copy 
individual items directly. By setting your iPod touch to manually manage 
music and videos, you can add content to your iPod touch directly via 
iTunes, and you can delete content as well. You can even copy some songs or 
videos from another computer’s iTunes library without deleting any content 
from your iPod touch. 
To set your iPod touch to manually manage music and videos, first connect 
your iPod touch to your computer. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the iPod touch name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source 
pane.
 
 After selecting the name, the Summary page appears, displaying the 
iPod touch sync options (see Figure 5-6).
 
2. Select the Manually Manage Music and Videos option, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
 
 iTunes displays a message warning you that disabling automatic 
synchronization requires manually ejecting the iPod touch before 
each disconnect.

75
 Chapter 5: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
Figure 5-6: Set your iPod touch to manually manage music and videos.
 
3. Click OK for the warning and click the Apply button to apply the 
change.
 
Don’t disconnect your iPod touch while managing music and videos manually. 
You have to eject it first, as spelled out in the next section. If you don’t, you 
may find that it doesn’t work properly and needs to be restored, as I describe 
in Chapter 14.
That album is just a drag
You can now select and drag music and video — songs, albums, audio books, 
music videos, movies, and TV shows — to your iPod touch name in the Source 
pane. You can drag the media from its section in the iTunes library or from an 
existing playlist or drag an entire playlist. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. In the iTunes Source pane, select the source of your media.
 
 You might select Music in the Library section, for instance, or a playlist 
in the library.
 
 You can select music in your library using List, Grid, or Cover Flow view 
(see Chapter 4 for browsing details), or select songs in a playlist.

76
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
2. Drag items (such as an album) directly from your iTunes library or play-
list over the iPod touch name in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 You can drag an entire album from Cover Flow view, as I show in Figure 
5-7, or from List or Grid view. When you drag an album cover or album 
title, all the songs in the album are copied. If you drag a playlist name 
from the Source pane to the iPod touch name, all the songs associated 
with the playlist copy along with the playlist itself.
 
Figure 5-7: Copy an album directly from the iTunes library to an iPod touch. (Mine is called 
Mojo iTouch.)
 
3. Wait for the copying to finish and then click the Eject button next to 
the iPod touch name in the Source pane to eject the iPod touch.
 
 Always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the 
copying is completed.
 
4. Disconnect your iPod touch from your computer.
Delete to make room for more
When you manually manage music and videos, you can also delete content 
from the iPod touch. Set the option to manually manage music and videos (if 
it isn’t set that way already) and then follow these steps:

77
 Chapter 5: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
1. In the Source pane, click the triangle to the left of the iPod touch 
name to expand its library.
 
 The iPod touch library appears in the Source pane with Music, Movies, 
TV Shows, and other sections, followed by playlists. The library is 
indented underneath the iPod touch name. 
 
2. Click any content type in the iPod touch library to see the items.
 
 The content items appear in the iTunes List pane to the right of the 
Source pane. 
 
3. Select an item and press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
 
 iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK 
to go ahead or Cancel to stop. If you want to delete a playlist, select the 
playlist underneath the iPod touch name in the Source pane and then 
press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete.
 
Like in the iTunes library, if you delete a playlist, the songs listed in the play-
list aren’t deleted. They’re still on your iPod touch unless you delete the 
songs directly from the iPod touch library.
Autofill it up
You can also automatically fill your iPod touch while managing music and 
videos manually: Autofill randomly picks songs from your entire iTunes 
library or from a playlist you select in the iTunes Source pane.
Set the option to manually manage music and videos (if it isn’t set that way 
already). Then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source pane, click the triangle to the left of the iPod touch 
name to expand its library.
 
 The iPod touch library appears in the Source pane.
 
2. Select Music under the iPod touch name in the Devices section of the 
Source pane.
 
 The music on your iPod touch appears in the List pane, along with the 
Autofill pane along the bottom, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
3. Choose your source of music in the Autofill From pop-up menu.
 
 Choose either a playlist, as I did in Figure 5-8 (Purchased Music), or 
Music for the entire music library. If you choose a playlist, Autofill uses 
only the playlist as the source to pick random songs. After choosing 
your source of music, iTunes creates a playlist and displays it in the 
List pane. 
 
4. (Optional) Click the Settings button to set options and then click OK.

78
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
Figure 5-8: Autofill your iPod touch from an iTunes playlist.
 
 After you click the Settings button, the Autofill Settings dialog appears. 
You can choose to replace all the songs on the iPod touch, to pick songs 
randomly, and to pick only the best songs (if choosing randomly). If you 
don’t select to replace all songs, iTunes adds the songs without replac-
ing existing songs. Click OK to close the Autofill Settings dialog.
 
5. Click the Autofill button to start copying songs.
 
 iTunes copies the contents of the Autofill playlist to your iPod touch.
 
6. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then click the Eject button.
 
 Always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the 
copying is finished.
 
You can click the Autofill button over and over to create different random 
playlists. When you get one you like, select all its contents and choose 
File➪New Playlist From Selection to create a new playlist that contains the 
songs generated by Autofill. The next time you connect your iPod touch, 
select this new playlist from the Autofill From pop-up menu and then click 
the Autofill button to load the music from the playlist to your iPod touch.

Syncing Your Day in the Life
In This Chapter
▶ Synchronizing e-mail, calendars, contacts, and bookmarks 
▶ Using MobileMe to sync over the Internet
▶ Setting up e-mail accounts on your iPod touch
Your iPod touch can take care of all aspects of your digital life: It can 
send and receive e-mail, keep track of your calendar and notes, sort 
your contacts, and save bookmarks to all your favorite Web sites as you 
browse them. 
If you’re a road warrior, you may want to fill up your iPod touch with your 
personal information. You can then go out into the world, conquer it, and 
bring back new or edited contacts, new events, and new Web site 
bookmarks, which you can then synchronize back with your 
computer.
Apps to Organize Your Life
Where do I start? First off, your iPod touch has no 
problem sending and receiving e-mail using the 
Mail application (as I describe in Chapter 11). It 
also offers the Contacts app to store contact info, 
the Calendar app to store events (see Chapter 13), 
the Notes app to take notes (see Chapter 2), and the 
Safari app to surf the Web with your bookmarks (see 
Chapter 10). With a little help from these apps, you’ll 
soon have your schedule whipped into such shape that it 
will be humming along like a finely tuned German automobile.

80
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
Keep in mind that you can use iTunes to synchronize your iPod touch apps 
with the calendars, contacts, notes, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks you’ve 
already organized on your computer. If you’re a Mac user, you have it easy: 
You can use the free iCal and Address Book applications to manage your cal-
endars and contacts, the free Mail application to manage e-mail, the free 
Notes Dashboard Widget for notes, and the free Safari Web browser to 
manage your bookmarks. All these applications are provided with Mac OS X. 
You can also sync contacts from Microsoft Entourage, Yahoo! Address Book, 
and Google Address Book, as well as sync calendars from Entourage.
If you’re a Windows user, you can sync your contacts and e-mail accounts 
with Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007, Yahoo! Address Book and Yahoo! Mail, 
Google Address Book and Gmail, Windows Address Book (Outlook Express), 
AOL (e-mail only), or Vista Contacts. You can sync calendars and notes 
with Outlook and use Microsoft Internet Explorer or Apple Safari to manage 
bookmarks. The iPod touch can also use the Exchange ActiveSync protocol 
to sync e-mail, calendars, and contacts with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 
Service Pack 2 or Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1. For many e-mail 
accounts, the settings automatically appear, like magic. 
If you signed up for Apple’s MobileMe service (formerly the .Mac service, 
now www.me.com), you can automatically keep your iPod touch synchro-
nized along with several computers and iPhones, all at once, with the latest 
e-mail, bookmarks, calendar entries, and contacts, as I describe in the “Going 
MobileMe to Sync Your iPod touch” section in this chapter.
What’s cool about cloud computing Web services like MobileMe, Microsoft 
Exchange, and Yahoo! Mail is that their e-mail services push e-mail messages 
to your computer and your iPod touch so that they arrive immediately, 
automatically. Other types of e-mail account services let you fetch e-mail from 
the server — you must first select the account in Mail on your iPod touch 
before your iPod touch can actually retrieve the e-mail. 
 
You probably already know how to manage your calendar activities and your 
contacts on your computer. In fact, you’re probably knee-deep in contacts, 
and your calendars look like they were drawn up in the West Wing. If not, 
visit the Tony’s Tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com) for advice 
on using MobileMe and on adding and editing contacts and calendar informa-
tion on your Mac (with Address Book and iCal) or Windows computer (with 
Outlook). I also explain how to use third-party utilities to manage personal 
information on your iPod touch.
Syncing Your Personal Info Using iTunes
You can sync your personal information between your computer and your 
iPod touch in two ways: either through iTunes, or wirelessly using MobileMe 

81
 Chapter 6: Syncing Your Day in the Life
(if you purchase the MobileMe service) or Microsoft Exchange. Please 
note that you’re not wedded to one method or the other — you can switch 
between the two any time you want. 
MobileMe and Exchange get their write-ups in the next section, while this 
section tackles the iTunes method. To synchronize your iPod touch with 
contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, notes, and bookmarks by using iTunes, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the iPod touch and select its name when it appears in the 
Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the iPod touch sync options to the right of the Source 
pane, with the Summary page (under the Summary tab) open. 
 
2. Click the Info tab.
 
 The Info sync options page appears as shown in Figure 6-1, offering the 
Contacts, Calendars, Web Browser, Notes, Mail Accounts, and Advanced 
sections. (Not all sections are visible in Figure 6-1.)
 
 
Figure 6-1: Synchronize selected contact groups and all calendars with the iPod touch.

82
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
3. Select the option to synchronize contacts.
 
 On a Mac: Select the Sync Address Book Contacts check box. You can 
also sync with Yahoo! Address Book or Google Contacts — click the 
Configure button to enter your login information. An option to sync with 
Microsoft Entourage appears if you have the application on your Mac.
 
 On a Windows PC: Select the Sync Contents With option and choose 
Yahoo! Address Book, Windows Address Book, Google Contacts, or 
Outlook from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 6-1).
 
4. Select the All Contacts option or select the Selected Groups option and 
choose which groups to synchronize.
 
 You can synchronize all contacts or just selected groups of contacts. To 
choose groups, select the check box next to each group in the list; scroll 
the list to see more groups.
 
 If you select groups, you can also select the Put New Contacts Created 
on this iPod Into the Group option, and choose a group for the new 
contacts you create on your iPod touch.
 
5. Scroll the page and select the option to synchronize calendars. 
 
 On a Mac, select the Sync iCal Calendars check box; an option to sync 
with Entourage also appears if you have it on your Mac. On a Windows 
PC, select the Sync Calendars With option and choose Outlook from the 
pop-up menu.
 
6. Select the All Calendars option. (Alternatively, if you’re using iCal 
with Mac OS X, select the Selected Calendars option and choose the 
calendars to synchronize.)
 
 In Windows, you can synchronize all calendars with Outlook, but not 
selected calendars. With iCal on Mac OS X, you can synchronize all 
calendars or just those you select. To choose specific calendars, select 
the check box next to each calendar in the list. 
 
 You can also set the Do Not Sync Events Older Than xx Days option, in 
which you can set the xx number of days.
 
7. Select the calendar to use for new events entered into your iPod touch 
(Mac OS X only).
 
 If you’re using Mac OS X and iCal, you should set the calendar to use for 
new events you create on your iPod touch. Choose a calendar name in 
the Put New Events Into the Calendar option. When you create a new 
event on your iPod touch (as I describe in Chapter 13) and sync it back 
to your computer, the new event appears in this calendar. This affects 
only new events — events you modify on your iPod touch retain their 
calendar information from before. 

83
 Chapter 6: Syncing Your Day in the Life
 
 Because you can’t select individual calendars with Outlook in 
Windows, this option is grayed out — all events you create on iPod 
touch synchronize with the Outlook main calendar.
 
8. To synchronize Web bookmarks, scroll down to the Web Browser 
section and select the Sync Bookmarks option.
 
 On a Mac running OS X, the option is Sync Safari Bookmarks; on a 
Windows PC, iTunes selects Internet Explorer or Safari for this option, 
depending on which one is your default browser.
 
9. To synchronize notes, scroll down to the Notes section.
 
 You can sync the notes you create in the Notes app (see Chapter 2) with 
the Notes Dashboard Widget on a Mac, or with Outlook on a Windows 
PC. On a Mac, select the Sync Notes option; on a Windows PC, choose 
Outlook from the pop-up menu for the Sync Notes With option.
 
10. To synchronize e-mail accounts, scroll down to see the Mail Accounts 
section and select the Sync Selected Mail Accounts option.
 
 Mail Accounts, as shown in Figure 6-2, appears below the Calendars 
section in the Info sync options page. On a Mac, select the Sync Selected 
Mail Accounts option. On a Windows PC, choose Outlook or Outlook 
Express from the pop-up menu for the Sync Selected Mail Accounts 
From option. After selecting the sync option, a list of e-mail accounts 
appears in the box below the option.
 
11. Choose the e-mail accounts you want to sync.
 
 To choose accounts, select the check box next to each account in the 
list; scroll the list to see more e-mail accounts.
 
12. Click the Apply button to apply the changes. (Alternatively, click 
Cancel to cancel the changes.)
 
 iTunes starts to synchronize your iPod touch. 
 
13. Wait for the sync to finish and then click the Eject button next to the 
iPod touch name in the Source pane to eject the iPod touch.
 
 Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) displays the message Sync 
is Complete.
After setting the synchronization options, every time you connect your iPod 
touch, iTunes automatically synchronizes it with your personal sync options. 
Synchronizing an e-mail account to your iPod touch copies only the e-mail 
account setup information; the messages are retrieved by the iPod touch 
over the Internet. Whether the messages in your inbox appear on your iPod 
touch and on your computer depends on the type of e-mail account you have 
and how you’ve configured it.

84
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
 
Figure 6-2: Synchronize e-mail accounts.
 
If you select a calendar or a group of contacts to be synchronized and later 
want to remove that particular calendar or group of contacts, deselect the 
calendar (see the preceding Step 6) or the group (see the preceding Step 4) 
and then click Apply to resynchronize. iTunes synchronizes only the group 
of contacts and calendars selected, removing from the iPod touch any that 
aren’t selected.
iTunes also offers Advanced options at the bottom of the Info page (refer 
to Figure 6-2) for synchronizing your iPod touch from scratch to replace all 
contacts, calendars, notes, or mail accounts. You can choose which ones 
you want to replace by selecting the check box next to each option. iTunes 
replaces the information once, during the next sync operation. After that 
operation, these Advanced options are automatically turned off.
Going MobileMe to Sync Your iPod touch
MobileMe synchronizes MobileMe e-mail accounts along with contacts, 
calendars, and bookmarks, on a Web server — also known as the cloud. You 
can then keep your iPod touch synchronized to the cloud wirelessly, without 
having to connect it to your computer.

85
 Chapter 6: Syncing Your Day in the Life
 
The place to start organizing your information is usually your computer. 
However, if you’ve already entered contacts and calendars on your iPod 
touch, sync your contacts and calendars on your iPod touch with iTunes 
first, as I describe earlier in “Syncing Your Personal Info Using iTunes.” Then 
sync your computer with MobileMe, and then your iPod touch with 
MobileMe.
 
Make sure the information you synchronize the very first time to MobileMe 
is the correct, complete information. You should synchronize your primary 
source — typically your computer — with MobileMe before synchronizing 
your iPod touch. 
MobileMe first makes its appearance when you set up your iPod touch: An 
advertisement appears with buttons to try MobileMe. If you skipped the 
ad (like many people do), you can go to the Apple MobileMe setup page 
(www.apple.com/mobileme) and sign up for a free trial. After setting 
up your MobileMe account on a Mac or Windows PC, as described in the 
next sections, you turn on your MobileMe account on your iPod touch, 
as I describe in “Setting Up Mail Accounts on Your iPod touch”.
Setting up on a Mac
Setting up MobileMe is easy on a Mac: When you sign in to MobileMe for the 
first time, MobileMe automatically configures Mac OS X Mail on your Mac to 
send and receive e-mail from your MobileMe account and to synchronize con-
tacts from Address Book and calendars from iCal. If you already set up your 
iPod touch with a Mac and MobileMe service, automatic synchronization 
should already be set up on that Mac. 
If not, you can set up a Mac to sync with MobileMe at any time. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, choose MobileMe, 
click the Account tab, and sign in.
 
 If you see the .Mac logo instead (for older versions of Mac OS X), select 
.Mac and sign in. Follow the onscreen instructions, if they appear.
 
2. Click the Sync tab.
 
 The Sync options for MobileMe appear, as shown in Figure 6-3.
 
3. Select the Synchronize with MobileMe check box and then choose a 
sync interval from the pop-up menu. (Refer to Figure 6-3.)
 
 For the most frequent updates, choose Automatically to sync with 
MobileMe every 15 minutes.

86
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
 
Figure 6-3: Sync options for MobileMe on a Mac.
 
4. Click the check boxes to select information to sync with MobileMe.
 
 You can choose to sync just contacts, calendars, bookmarks, or mail 
accounts, or all of them. 
 
5. Click the Sync Now button.
 
 The sync commences. To make sure your data has synced, go to www.
me.com, log in, and click the Contacts and Calendar icons along the top 
row of icons on the left.
Setting up on Windows
Download and install on your PC the latest version of MobileMe Control 
Panel for Windows, available from http://support.apple.com/down-
loads. MobileMe Control Panel is required to set up and manage MobileMe 
syncing and manage iDisk settings on a Windows PC.
To set up a Windows PC to sync with MobileMe or to check your sync 
settings or sync immediately, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Windows Start menu, open Control Panel and choose 
MobileMe Control Panel.
 
 The MobileMe panel appears with tabs along the top.

87
 Chapter 6: Syncing Your Day in the Life
 
2. Click the Account tab for the Account pane (if it isn’t already visible) 
and log in with your MobileMe member name and password if you 
aren’t already logged in.
 
3. Click the Sync tab.
 
 The sync options appear, as 
shown in Figure 6-4.
 
4. Select the Sync with MobileMe 
check box and then select a 
sync interval.
 
 For the most frequent updates, 
choose Automatically to 
sync with MobileMe every 15 
minutes.
 
5. Select the check boxes to sync 
your contacts, calendars, and 
bookmarks, and then use the 
drop-down lists to choose 
which Windows applications 
you want to use when syncing 
with these items.
 
6. Click the Sync Now button.
 
 The sync starts up. To make 
sure your data has synced, go to 
www.me.com, log in, and click 
the Contacts and Calendar icons along the top row of icons on the left.
When you sync upon a cloud
If your contacts or calendar entries show up in duplicate or triplicate on 
your iPod touch or computer, as if they were stuck inside of MobileMe with 
the memory blues again, you probably need to overwrite the data in the 
MobileMe cloud.
Selecting items to synchronize may not overwrite all the data in the cloud. To 
overwrite the data stored in the cloud with the data on your computer, open 
MobileMe (in System Preferences on a Mac, or Control Panel in Windows), 
click the Sync tab, and then click the Advanced button. (Refer to Figure 6-3 
for a Mac, or Figure 6-4 for Windows.) Select the computer you are syncing 
from in the list at the top and then click Reset Sync Data. 
Figure 6-4: Sync options for MobileMe on a 
Windows PC.

88
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
In the dialog that appears, choose an option from the Replace pop-up menu:
 
✓ On a Mac, you can choose All Sync Info, Bookmarks, Calendars, or 
Contacts. (The other choices in the pop-up menu — Key Chains, Mail 
Accounts, and so on — don’t copy over to the iPod touch, but are useful 
for keeping other computers synchronized.)
 
✓ In Windows, you can choose All Sync Info, Bookmarks, Calendars, or 
Contacts. 
After choosing an option from the Replace pop-up menu, click the arrow 
underneath the Cloud icon to change the animation so that the data arrow 
points from the computer to the cloud. Finally, click Replace.
This action replaces the data in the MobileMe cloud with the data on 
your computer. You can also use these steps to go in reverse — replace 
the data on your computer with the data in MobileMe. To do this, click 
the arrow so that the animation points the arrow from the cloud to the 
computer.
 
Changes you make to contacts, calendars, and bookmarks in your iPod touch 
are synchronized to the Web server at www.me.com. You can also go to www.
me.com and access your information directly with your Web browser.
Setting Up Mail Accounts on Your iPod touch 
To set up a Mail account on your iPod touch — including a MobileMe e-mail 
account (with contacts, calendars, and bookmarks) or a Microsoft Exchange 
account — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen.
 
 The Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears, with the 
Accounts section at the top, as shown in Figure 6-5 (left side).
 
2. Tap the Add Account button and then tap the account type from the 
list of account types that appears.
 
 Your choices are Microsoft Exchange, MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, 
AOL, or Other, as shown in Figure 6-5 (right side). After tapping the 
account type, the New Account screen appears for Exchange, MobileMe, 
Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL accounts, and the Other screen appears for 
Other accounts.

password, and optional description in the New Account screen, and 
then tap Save in the upper-right corner. If the account is verified, you’re 
done for a Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or AOL account and you can skip the rest 
of these steps — the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears 
with the new account listed in the Accounts section. For MobileMe, your 
iPod touch displays account’s settings screen. (If your account doesn’t 
verify, try Steps 2 and 3 again.)
 
 Exchange: Enter your name, username, domain (optional), password, 
and optional description in the New Account screen, and then tap Next 
in the upper-right corner to move on to the Exchange account’s settings 
screen. Microsoft’s Autodiscovery service kicks in to check your user 
name and password to determine the address of the Exchange server. If 
it can’t find the server’s address, a dialog appears for you to enter it — 
enter the complete address in the Server field and tap Save. 
 
 Other: Tap Add Mail Account on the Other screen for an IMAP (Internet 
Message Access Protocol) or POP (Post Office Protocol) account. The 
New Account screen appears; enter your name, username, password, 
and an optional description, and then tap Save in the upper-right corner 
to save account information. The iPod touch searches for the account 
on the Internet and displays the New Account settings screen.

4. Set your mail account settings in the New Account settings screen as 
follows:
 
 MobileMe or Exchange: Turn on any or all of the items you want to 
sync: Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Bookmarks (MobileMe only). If 
you sync contacts, calendars, or bookmarks using your MobileMe or 
Exchange account, syncing them in iTunes is turned off. Any contacts, 
calendars, and bookmarks on your iPod touch are replaced by the 
MobileMe or Exchange account versions. You can always return to the 
account setting’s screen to turn them off in order to enable syncing with 
iTunes. For Exchange, you can set how many days of e-mail you want to 
sync. Tap Save in the upper-right corner to finish and save your settings.
 
 Other: Tap IMAP or POP on the New Account settings screen, depending 
on the type of e-mail account you have — ask your e-mail service provider 
if you don’t know. Then enter or edit the existing account information 
(also get this information from your service provider if you don’t know). 
Tap Save in the upper-right corner to finish and save your settings. The 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears with the new account 
listed in the Accounts section.
 
5. When the Sync or Cancel warning appears for MobileMe or Exchange 
accounts, tap Sync (or Cancel).
 
 When you tap the Sync button, MobileMe or Exchange overwrites any 
existing contacts, calendars, and bookmarks on your iPod touch (or 
the subset of these that you chose in Step 4). After syncing, the Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears with the new account 
listed in the Accounts section.
 
6. Tap Fetch New Data on the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen, 
and tap Off for Push to turn it on (if it isn’t already on).
That’s it! Your iPod touch syncs automatically from this point on, with data 
pushed or fetched from the e-mail account depending on your Push and Fetch 
settings (see Chapter 11 for details). 
Changing and Deleting Mail Accounts 
You can temporarily turn off a Mail account on your iPod touch, as well 
as change its settings or delete it. To turn off a Mail account in your iPod 
touch temporarily or change account settings, choose Settings➪Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen, and then touch the account in 
the Accounts section to see that account’s settings screen. You can then 
change your account’s settings, including the items that are synced with a 
MobileMe or Exchange account.

91
 Chapter 6: Syncing Your Day in the Life
To delete the account, scroll down and tap Delete Account. Deleting a 
Mail account from iPod touch doesn’t delete the e-mail account itself or its 
settings on your computer.
 
Changes you make to accounts are not transferred back to your computer 
when you synchronize, so it’s safe to make changes without affecting e-mail 
account settings on your computer.
 
It’s way beyond the scope of this book to explain all of the e-mail account 
and advanced options. Grab your network administrator or Internet service 
provider and offer free coffee in exchange for help. If you don’t have anyone 
to turn to, visit the tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com) for tips 
on using MobileMe and other e-mail accounts, and changing e-mail account 
settings on your iPod touch.

Playing It Back 
with Interest

H
ere’s the big playback for your efforts. This 
part shows you how to play music, TV 
shows, movies, podcasts, audio books, and slide-
shows on your iPod touch. 
Chapter 7 is all about playing songs. I show you 
how to ﬁ nd songs, control the playback and 
volume, shufﬂ e and repeat songs and albums, 
and create playlists right on your iPod touch.
Next, Chapter 8 shows you to how to locate and 
play videos, including movies, TV shows, and 
YouTube videos. You can skip forward or back-
ward, scale the picture to ﬁ t the display, and 
bookmark your favorite sections. I also show you 
how to play podcasts and audio books.
Then, in Chapter 9, you ﬁ nd out all about synchro-

The Songs Remain the Same
In This Chapter
▶ Locating items by artist, album, or playlist
▶ Repeating and shuffling a song list
▶ Creating and saving On-The-Go and Genius playlists
▶ Changing the volume level and volume limit
E
ven though the iPod and iTunes have irrevocably changed the entertain-
ment industry and how you enjoy music, one thing remains the same: 
You still play songs. You just play them with more panache on your iPod 
touch.
You can pick any song that you want to hear at any time. You can also shuffle 
through songs to get an idea of how wide your music choices are 
or to surprise yourself or others. Browse by artist and album, 
select a playlist, and even create playlists on-the-fly — 
this chapter explains it all.
Locating “A Song for You”
With so many songs on your iPod touch, find-
ing a particular song by its title may take longer 
than finding it another way — like finding a needle 
in a haystack or even trying to find “Needle in a 
Haystack” by The Velvelettes. It may be faster to 
locate albums by cover art or to find songs by search-
ing for artist (or composer), genre, album, or playlist. 
You can browse your music any number of ways without 
interrupting the music you’re playing.

96
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
Going with the Cover Flow
Cover Flow (also called the cover browser) lets you flip through your cover 
art to select music alphabetically by artist. Choose Music from the Home 
screen and then turn the iPod touch quickly to view it horizontally. This 
movement changes the display to landscape mode and displays the cover 
browser, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Slide your finger across the album 
covers to scroll swiftly through the 
music library, or tap to the right or 
left of the cover art in the foreground 
to move forward or backward an 
album cover at a time. 
Tap the Play button in the lower-left 
corner (shown in Figure 7-1) to start 
playing the first song in the fore-
ground album; the Play button turns 
to a Pause button so that you can tap 
it again to stop playback. Tap the i 
button in the lower-right corner (or 
tap the foreground cover art) to list 
the songs in that album. Then you 
can tap a song to start playing it.
Touching artists 
and albums
You can quickly and easily locate a 
song by looking up either the song’s 
artist or its album. To browse music 
by artist, tap the Music icon on the 
Home screen and tap the Artists icon 
along the bottom row of the Music 
screen. A scrollable list of artists 
appears, with an alphabet listed ver-
tically along the right side, as shown 
in Figure 7-2. 
Tap any letter in the alphabet shown 
on the right to scroll the list directly 
to that letter. Tap an artist name to 
see a list of albums or songs by that 
Figure 7-1: Cover Flow: the cover browser.

 Chapter 7: The Songs Remain the Same
artist. (You see multiple albums if 
more than one album is available — 
tap the album name to select the 
album.) Tap a song title to start 
playing the song.
To browse music by album title, tap 
the Albums icon along the bottom 
row of the Music screen. Albums 
appear in a scrollable list with the 
album cover on the left side and an 
alphabet listed vertically along the 
right side, as shown in Figure 7-3. 
Slide your finger up and down the 
alphabet to scroll quickly, or tap any 
letter in the alphabet to scroll the list 
directly to that letter. Tap an album 
title or its cover art to see a list of 
songs in the album. Tap a song title 
to start playing the song.
Choosing a playlist
When you synchronize your iPod 
touch with your entire iTunes library, 
your iTunes playlists are included. Well, that makes sense, doesn’t it? To 
browse music by playlist on your iPod touch, tap the Music icon on the Home 
screen and tap the Playlists icon along the bottom row of the Music screen. A 
scrollable list of playlists appears. Tap a playlist title to see a list of songs in 
the playlist and tap a song title to start playing the song.
The songs in the playlist are in the order defined for the playlist in iTunes. 
But don’t despair for lack of something new — you can create playlists in 
your iPod touch, as I describe later in this chapter.
Tapping song titles and more
To locate songs by title, tap the Music icon on the Home screen and tap the 
Songs icon along the bottom row of the Music screen. A scrollable list of 
songs appears with an alphabet listed vertically along the right side. Slide 
your finger up and down the alphabet to scroll quickly, or tap any letter in 
the alphabet to scroll the list directly to that letter. Tap a song title to start 
playing the song. 
Figure 7-3: Browse by album title.

98
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
You can also find music by composer or genre by tapping the More icon along 
the bottom row of the Music screen. You can then select Composers to see an 
alphabetical list of composers, or Genres to see all the genres of the songs in 
your iPod touch. Tap either a composer or a genre to see a list of songs.
Controlling Song Playback
To play a song, tap the song title (or the Play button in Cover Flow).
When the song finishes, the iPod touch plays the next song in the sequence 
that appeared in the Playlists, Artists, Songs, or Albums screen you chose 
it from. For example, if you chose a song in the Songs screen, the next song 
would be the next one in sequence in the Songs screen. If you chose the last 
song on an album in the Albums screen, the iPod touch stops after playing 
it. If you chose a song from a playlist on the Playlists screen, the next song 
would be the next one in the playlist, and after playing the last song it also 
stops playing, as with an album. (See the “Repeating songs” section later in 
this chapter to find out how to repeat albums and playlists.)
Whenever you play a song, you see 
the album cover associated with the 
song on the Now Playing screen. You 
also see the buttons for playback 
control — Previous/Rewind, Play/
Pause, and Next/Fast-Forward. (See 
Figure 7-4.) Slide your finger along 
the volume slider at the bottom of 
the display to change the volume.
Tap the Next/Fast-Forward button 
once to play the next song in 
sequence, and tap the Previous/
Rewind button once at the begin-
ning of a song, or twice during the 
song, to play the previous song. You 
can fast-forward through a song 
by touching and holding down on 
the Next/Fast-Forward button, and 
you can rewind a song by touching 
and holding down on the Previous/
Rewind button. 
You can tap the bullet-list button in 
the upper-right corner if you want to 
display a list of the album’s contents. 
You can then tap the title of another 
song on the album to start playing that song.
Figure 7-4: The Now Playing screen.

To return to menus and 
make other selections 
when playing a song, tap 
the left-arrow button in 
the upper-left corner 
of the display.
Tap underneath the 
left-arrow button or the 
album title while a song 
is playing to show more 
buttons and the scrubber 
bar for navigating through 
the song, as shown in 
Figure 7-5 — and if lyrics 
are available in the iTunes 
information, lyrics also 
appear.
To skip to any point in a 
song, drag the playhead 
along the scrubber bar. 
To start a song over from 
the beginning, drag the 
playhead on the scrub-
ber bar all the way to the 
left, or tap the Previous/
Rewind button once.
 
If you’re viewing another 
content menu on the iPod 
touch, tap Now Playing at 
the top-right corner of the 
display to go directly to the 
Now Playing display.
Repeating songs
If you want to drive yourself crazy repeating the same song over and over, 
your iPod touch is happy to oblige. (You might want to try repeating “They’re 
Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa” by Napoleon XIV, a favorite from the old 
The Dr. Demento Show radio broadcasts — and perhaps they will come to 
take you away.) More than likely, you’ll want to repeat a playlist or album, 
which you can easily do.
Tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album title while a song is play-
ing. The Repeat and Shuffle buttons appear, along with the scrubber bar and 
lyrics, directly below the top row of buttons. (Refer to Figure 7-5.)

Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
Ordinarily when a song finishes, the iPod touch plays the next song in the 
sequence that appeared in the Playlists, Artists, Songs, or Albums screen you 
chose it from. When it reaches the end of that list, it stops — if you chose 
the last song on an album in the Albums screen, the iPod touch stops after 
playing it. But if you tap the Repeat button once while the songs are playing, 
the entire sequence repeats. If you chose an album, the album repeats; if you 
chose a playlist, the playlist repeats. 
After you tap Repeat once to repeat the sequence of songs, the Repeat button 
shows blue highlighting. Tap the Repeat button again to repeat only the cur-
rent song — the button changes to include a blue-highlighted numeral 1. Tap 
it once more to return to normal playback.
Shuffling song order
Maybe you want your song selections to be surprising and unpredictable, 
and you want your iPod touch to read your mind. You can shuffle song play-
back to play in random order, just like an automated radio station without a 
disk jockey or program guide. 
You can just shake your iPod touch, and it shuffles the songs in the album 
you are playing. By default, your iPod touch is set to shuffle when shaken 
(not stirred). Choose Settings➪Music from the Home screen, and touch On 
for the Shake to Shuffle option to turn it off.
You can also set your iPod touch to shuffle songs across your library. The 
shuffle algorithm is as random as it gets (not taking into account a funda-
mental tenet of chaos theory that says a pattern will emerge). When an iPod 
touch creates a shuffle, it reorders the songs (like shuffling a deck of cards) 
and then plays them in the new order.
To turn your iPod touch into a random song player, choose Music from the 
Home screen and tap the Songs icon at the bottom of the display. The song 
list appears, with Shuffle at the top of the list. Tap Shuffle to turn on Shuffle.
You can also shuffle songs within an album or playlist, which gives you some 
control over random playback. For example, you can create a playlist for 
all jazz songs and then shuffle the songs within that jazz playlist. To shuffle 
songs in an album or playlist, start playing a song in the album or playlist and 
then tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album title while a song is 
playing. The Repeat and Shuffle buttons appear, along with the scrubber bar, 
directly below the top row of buttons (refer to Figure 7-5). Tap the Shuffle 
button to shuffle songs within the currently playing album or playlist.
 
You can also set an iPod touch to shuffle any album or playlist before playing 
it. First, select the playlist or album; then tap Shuffle at the top of the list of 
songs for that playlist or album.

101
 Chapter 7: The Songs Remain the Same
 
Want to repeat an entire album or playlist but still shuffle the playing order 
each time you hear it? Start playing a song in the album or playlist and then 
set your iPod touch to repeat all the songs in the album or playlist as 
described in the preceding section, “Repeating songs.” Then set the iPod 
touch to shuffle the songs as described in this section.
Creating Playlists on Your iPod touch
If you don’t like the playlists copied over from your iTunes library, go out and 
make some of your own!
You can create a temporary, On-The-Go playlist, queuing the songs in the 
order you want, right on your iPod touch. The selections appear automati-
cally in a playlist appropriately called On-The-Go, in the Playlists menu. This 
option is particularly useful for picking songs to play right before driving a 
car. (Hel-lo! You shouldn’t be messing with your iPod touch while driving.)
Your iPod touch can also be a genius about picking songs. If you don’t want to 
go through the process of selecting songs, just select one song and click the 
Genius button. Your iPod touch takes a look at whatever song you select, and it 
creates a playlist of songs already on 
the iPod touch that go along with it.
Ordering playlists 
On-The-Go
Follow these steps to select songs for 
your On-The-Go playlist:
 
1. Choose Music from the Home 
screen.
 
 The Music screen appears with 
the Playlists and other icons 
along the bottom of the display.
 
2. Tap the Playlists icon and 
choose On-The-Go from the 
Playlists list.
 
 The Songs list appears with a 
plus (+) sign next to each song, 
as well as an Add All Songs 
option at the top, as shown in 
Figure 7-6. If you have only 
several dozen albums, this list 
isn’t too long, and you can skip 
to Step 4. If you have a lot more music, narrow your search with Step 3.
Figure 7-6: Add songs to the On-The-Go playlist.

102
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
 
3. (Optional) Tap Playlists, Artists, Songs, or More to narrow your search 
for songs to add to the On-The-Go playlist.
 
 Tap an icon along the bottom row (see Figure 7-6) to browse your iPod 
touch library — tap Playlists to select songs from playlists or entire 
playlists; tap Artists to browse artists to select songs; or tap More to 
select songs from albums or compilations, to browse by genre, or to 
select audio books or podcast episodes.
 
4. Tap the plus (+) sign next to a song you want to add to the On-The-Go 
playlist, or tap the plus sign next to Add All Albums to add all the 
albums of an artist found in Step 3.
 
 As you tap the plus sign for a song, that song is included in the 
On-The-Go playlist, and it turns gray in the list so that you know it has 
already been selected. You can tap Add All Albums as an alternative if 
you want to add all the songs for a particular artist — first browse for 
that artist in Step 3.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, adding songs in the order you want them 
played.
 
 You can continue to add songs to the list. Your iPod touch keeps track 
of the On-The-Go playlist until you clear it (as I describe a bit later in 
this section) or synchronize your iPod touch, as I describe in Chapter 5. 
 
6. Tap the Done button when you’re finished adding songs. 
 
 The Done button appears in the upper-right corner while you select 
songs, just waiting for you to finish. After touching Done, you return to 
the list of songs in the On-The-Go playlist, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
7. To start playing the On-The-Go playlist, tap any song.
 
 Scroll up or down the list (see Figure 7-7) to choose a song, and tap the 
song title to play the playlist starting from that song. You can tap Shuffle 
to shuffle the songs in the playlist.
 
The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order you added them). You 
can change that order by tapping the Edit button (see Figure 7-7), which dis-
plays the Edit screen with a Move icon (three horizontal bars, like half of an 
I-Ching symbol) on the far right side of each song. Drag the Move icon for a 
song to move it up or down the list. Then tap the Done button at the top of 
the Edit screen.
 
You can also add entire playlists, entire albums, or everything by an artist to 
the On-The-Go playlist. In Step 4, tap the Playlists, Artists, or More icon fol-
lowed by the Albums selection to show one of those menus, and then select a 
playlist, album, or artist. Finally, tap All Songs at the top of the list of song 
selections.
After creating the On-The-Go playlist, it remains defined in your iPod touch 
until you clear it. It turns out that when you synchronize your iPod touch 
with your iTunes library, doing so copies the On-The-Go playlist to your 

103
 Chapter 7: The Songs Remain the Same
iTunes library so that you don’t lose it. (You can rename it there.) That 
means you no longer need that particular On-The-Go playlist on your iPod 
touch, and it’s automatically cleared so that you can start creating a new one.
You can also clear the On-The-Go playlist completely in one step: Just tap 
the Clear button. (See Figure 7-7.) To remove just one or a few songs from 
the On-The-Go playlist, repeat Steps 1 and 2 earlier in this section and then 
follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Edit button (see 
Figure 7-7).
 
 The Edit screen appears with 
circled minus (–) signs appear 
in front of each song title. 
 
2. Scroll the list to find the item 
you want to delete.
 
3. Tap the minus (–) sign next to 
the song to remove it; then tap 
the Delete button.
 
 The red Delete button appears 
after you touch the circled 
minus sign.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to find 
and remove each item from the 
playlist.
 
 When you remove songs, they 
disappear from the On-The-Go 
playlist one by one. The songs 
themselves are not deleted and 
are still in your iPod touch.
 
5. Tap Done at the top of the Edit 
screen to finish editing the list.
Consulting the iTunes Genius
The Genius button and its sidekick, the Genius sidebar in iTunes, work with 
the iTunes Store to match up your tastes to other iTunes users using a tech-
nique called collaborative filtering. The Genius working behind the scenes in 
the store analyzes the music and video in other people’s iTunes libraries — 
people who also have the same song or video you selected (if they also turn 
on the Genius feature in iTunes). The Genius sidebar appears next to the List 
pane in iTunes, and it informs the online store about the items you select 
Figure 7-7: The On-The-Go playlist ready to 
play (or be cleared).

104
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
whenever it’s open. It then shows you music and video that other listeners 
purchased when they purchased the items you’re playing. All of this informa-
tion is shared anonymously. 
For the Genius feature to work in your iPod touch, you must first give iTunes 
permission to scan your music library and catalog your iTunes collection, 
and then you need to sync your iPod touch (as I describe in Chapter 5). The 
scanning process may take a few minutes or (for very large collections) a few 
hours, but you can continue using iTunes while it scans your music. To do 
this, open the sidebar by clicking the Show/Hide Genius Sidebar button in the 
lower-right corner of the iTunes window. (Refer to Chapter 4). Then click the 
Turn on Genius button in the sidebar, enter your Apple ID and password for 
your iTunes Store account, and click Continue. 
If you don’t have an iTunes Store account yet, select the Create a New iTunes 
Store Account option and see Chapter 4 for further instructions on creating 
an account.
 
After you have enabled the Genius sidebar, you can turn off the Genius fea-
ture in iTunes by choosing Store➪Turn Off Genius, and turn it back on by 
choosing Store➪Turn On Genius. If you add new music to your iTunes 
library, you can tell iTunes to immediately update the Genius feature with 
new information by choosing Store➪Update Genius.
 
When you have the Genius sidebar open, iTunes transmits information to the 
store about the selection you’re playing. To hide the Genius sidebar (and 
stop transmitting this information), click the Show/Hide Genius sidebar 
button in the bottom-right corner of the iTunes window.
In your iPod touch, the Genius feature recognizes the song or video you 
selected, but you must have enough songs or videos on your iPod touch that 
match the Genius collaborative filtering technique (such as songs purchased 
by other people who also played the song you are playing). 
To create a Genius playlist on your iPod touch, choose Music from the Home 
screen and follow these steps:
 
1. Locate and start playing a song to base the Genius playlist on.
 
 The Now Playing screen appears when the song is playing.
 
2. Tap the Now Playing screen to see the control buttons.
 
 Tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album title while a song is 
playing. The Repeat, Genius, and Shuffle buttons appear underneath the 
scrubber bar directly below the top row of buttons. (Refer to Figure 7-5.) 
The Genius button is the one in the center sporting the atom icon.
 
3. Tap the Genius button.

105
 Chapter 7: The Songs Remain the Same
 
 The Genius playlist appears as shown in Figure 7-8, with New, Refresh, 
and Save buttons at the top. You can flick your finger to scroll the list. 
The Genius playlist can be as long as 25 songs. Tap any song to start 
playing the playlist from that song. 
 
4. (Optional) Refresh the Genius 
playlist by tapping Refresh.
 
 Refreshing a playlist changes 
it to include different songs 
based on the same song you 
played (depending on how 
many similar songs you have 
in your iPod touch). 
 
5. Save the Genius playlist by 
tapping Save.
 
 The playlist is saved in the 
Playlists section of your iPod 
touch using the title of the song 
it is based on. The playlist is 
copied back to your iTunes 
library when you sync your 
iPod touch. That’s all you need 
to do — the next steps are 
optional.
 
 If you subsequently refresh a 
saved Genius playlist before 
syncing, the saved playlist is 
refreshed and you lose the 
previous version of it.
 
6. (Optional) Create a new Genius 
playlist by tapping New and 
then selecting a new song to base it on.
 
 After touching New, the song list appears for selecting a song. Choose a 
song, and your iPod touch creates a new Genius playlist and starts play-
ing the song, displaying the Now Playing screen.
 
7. (Optional) After Step 6, return to the Genius playlist by tapping the 
left-arrow button in the top-left corner of the Now Playing screen.
 
You can refresh any Genius playlist, whether you created it in iTunes and 
synced to your iPod touch or you created it directly on your iPod touch. 
Select the playlist and tap Refresh at the top of the list (or tap Delete to 
delete the list).

song “Dreaming with a Broken Heart” by John 
Mayer.

106
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
 
You can set an iPod touch to create a Genius playlist based on a song before 
you actually start playing the song itself. Just choose Music from the Home 
screen and then tap Playlists in the bottom-left corner of the display. Tap 
Genius at the top of the list of playlists, and a list of songs appear. Select a 
song, and your iPod touch creates a Genius playlist based on it and then 
starts playing the song you selected. To return to the Genius playlist, tap the 
left-arrow button in the top-left corner of the Now Playing screen.
In search of the lost chord
If you don’t like the music, go out and make 
some yourself! You can look for the chord the 
guitar player is playing in a song, and you can 
try to play it yourself with PocketGuitar (avail-
able in the App Store), an app that turns your 
iPod touch into a virtual guitar. You can press 
and strum strings with your fingers on the iPod 
touch screen.
For anyone who plays guitar or wants to play 
one, you can’t beat the value of GuitarToolkit, 
an iPod touch app (available in the App Store) 
that provides a chromatic tuner, a chord finder, 
a metronome, and pitch reference tones. The 
tuner itself (see figure with the meter) is worth 
the price ($9.99 as of this writing) and is far 
more convenient than carrying a separate 
tuner. The chord finder lets you quickly cycle 
through chords and see the fingering for each 
chord. Slide your fingers across the iPod touch 
screen to strum the chord. The scales feature 
offers a playable fretboard (see figure with the 
guitar fretboard) to hear what each note sounds 
like, and the metronome lets you dial in an exact 
count in beats per minute (BPM) or tap along to 
a song to get the tempo.

Because an iPod touch can be quite loud when set to its highest volume, I 
recommend turning down the volume before using headphones.
To adjust volume, follow these steps:
 
1. Play something on the iPod touch.
 
2. While the content is playing, tap the lower portion of the display and 
slide your finger on the volume slider.
 
 After tapping the lower portion of the display while playing something, 
the volume slider with a silver knob appears on the iPod touch screen 
at the bottom of the display underneath the playback controls. (Refer to 
Figure 7-4.) Use your finger to slide the knob to the right to increase the 
volume or to the left to decrease the volume.
You can also limit the highest volume for your iPod touch to be lower than 
the actual maximum. This limit can help protect your hearing while you’re 
listening to content from sources with different volume levels. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪Music from the Home screen.
 
2. Choose Volume Limit from the Music settings screen.
 
 A volume slider appears with a silver knob. 
 
3. Slide your finger on the volume slider to limit the volume.
 
 Slide the knob with your finger to the right to increase the volume or to 
the left to decrease the volume. 
 
4. Tap the Music button in the upper-left corner of the display to set the 
limit and return to the previous menu, or, if you want, tap the Lock 
Volume Limit button to lock the volume limit.
 
 If you accept the new limit without locking it, you get to skip the next 
step; you’re done. The lock is useful for locking the volume limit so 
others can’t change it (such as your children). However, it also means 
that you have to enter the volume limit code to unlock the iPod touch in 
order to change the volume limit.
 
5. Set the Volume Limit Code for locking the volume limit.
 
 If you tapped the Lock Volume Limit button to lock the volume limit, 
your iPod touch displays four squares for entering a code number. Tap 
the calculator-style number pad to type numbers for your code and be 
sure to make up a code that you can remember! (If you don’t want to 
enter a code, tap the Cancel button in the upper-left corner.)

Tweaking the Sound
Maybe you want more bone-rattling bass or treble highs that are as clear as 
a bell. The equalizer allows you to fine-tune sound spectrum frequencies in a 
more precise way than with the typical bass and treble controls you find on 
home stereos and powered speakers. 
Or maybe some of your songs are just too loud. I don’t mean too loud stylisti-
cally, as in thrash metal with screeching guitars; I mean too loud for your ears 
when you’re wearing headphones or so loud that the music sounds distorted 
in your speakers. And some songs are just too soft; you have to increase the 
volume to hear them and then lower the volume to listen to louder songs. To 
remedy instances like these, you can set the volume in advance in iTunes. 
With songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos that you already 
know are too loud (or too soft), consider setting the volume for those items 
in advance so that they always play with the desired volume adjustment. You 
can even set the volume for entire albums or podcasts.
To adjust the overall volume of a particular item in advance so that it always 
plays at that setting, perform the following steps in iTunes:
 
1. Select one or more items in your iTunes library.
 
 To set the volume in iTunes for multiple songs, you can select an entire 
album in Browse view or you can select all the songs. To set the volume 
for a whole podcast, select it instead of individual episodes.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
 
 The information dialog appears.
 
3. Click the Options tab.
 
4. Drag the Volume Adjustment slider left or right to adjust the volume 
lower or higher, as shown in Figure 7-9. 
 
 You can do this while playing the file.
You can standardize the volume level of all the songs in your iTunes library 
with the Sound Check option in iTunes. This option has the added benefit of 
applying the same volume adjustment when you play the songs back on your 
iPod touch. 
Peaking with the Sound Check
Sound Check scans the audio files, finds each track’s peak volume level, and 
then uses this peak volume information to level the playing volume of tracks 
so that they have the same peak volume (this is called normalization in audio 
terms). The sound quality isn’t affected, nor is the audio information changed: 
The volume is simply adjusted at the start of the track to be in line with other 

109
 Chapter 7: The Songs Remain the Same
tracks. If you mix early ’60s music with today’s much louder music, like I do, 
all the songs play at relatively the same volume (so I don’t have to adjust the 
volume) without any loss in quality. 
 
 
Figure 7-9: Adjust the volume setting in advance for a song.
To enable Sound Check to work in your iPod touch, first follow these steps 
in iTunes:
 
1. Drag the iTunes volume slider to set the overall volume for iTunes.
 
 The volume slider is located in the top-left corner of the iTunes window, 
to the right of the Play button.
 
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
3. In the iTunes Preferences dialog that appears, click the Playback tab.
 
 The Playback preferences appear.
 
4. Select the Sound Check box.
 
 iTunes sets the volume level for all songs according to the level of the 
iTunes volume slider.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Sound Check option sets a volume adjustment based on the volume 
slider on all the songs so that they play at approximately the same volume.

110
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
The operation runs in the background while you do other things. If you quit 
iTunes and then restart it, the operation continues where it left off when you 
quit. You can switch Sound Check on or off at any time.
To take advantage of volume leveling already set up in your iTunes library, 
you need to turn on Sound Check in your iPod touch. Choose Settings➪Music 
from the Home screen to show the Music settings screen, and tap the Off 
button next to Sound Check to turn it on. Tap On to turn it back off.
All things being equal(ized)
You can use the iPod touch’s built-in equalizer to improve or enhance the 
sound coming through a particular stereo system and speakers. With the 
equalizer settings, you can customize playback for different musical genres, 
listening environments, or speakers.
 
The iPod touch equalizer uses a bit more battery power when it’s on, so you 
might have less playing time.
 
The quality of the sound is no better than the speakers you play it on. When 
you adjust the sound coming from your iPod touch, use your everyday listen-
ing environment as a guide. If you tweak the sound specifically for your com-
puter speakers or for your home stereo and speakers, though, remember 
that with an iPod touch you have other potential listening environments — 
different headphones, car stereo systems, portable boom boxes, and so on.
To set the equalizer setting, choose Settings➪Music from the Home screen 
and tap EQ to display a list of presets. You can scroll the list of presets and 
tap a preset to select it — a check mark appears next to it after you select it. 
The equalizer is set to Off until you select one of the presets. 
Each equalizer preset offers a different balance of frequencies designed to 
enhance the sound in certain ways. For example, Bass Booster increases the 
volume of the low (bass) frequencies; Treble Booster does the same to the 
high (treble) frequencies.
 
To see what a preset actually does to the frequencies, choose Window➪
Equalizer in iTunes to open the iTunes equalizer; then select the same preset 
by name. The faders in the equalizer show you exactly what the preset does.
 
Find out how to assign standard iTunes presets or your own custom presets 
to specific songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos — and use those 
presets when playing these items back on your iPod touch — by visiting the 
tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com/tonytips).

T
he iPod touch is a terrific video player, with crisp, clear picture quality. 
Video appears horizontally on the screen (in what’s known as landscape 
mode), and if you rotate the iPod touch 180 degrees to the opposite horizon-
tal position, the video adjusts accordingly. All the controls you expect in a 
DVD player are right on the screen at the touch of a finger. 
You can also play audio books and podcasts on this multimedia machine. 
The iTunes Store offers an amazing selection of TV shows, movies, 
audio books, and podcasts. (See Chapter 4.) This chapter 
shows you how to control video playback, skip forward or 
backward, and scale the picture to fit your screen. It also 
shows you how to watch videos on YouTube, the free 
video-sharing Web site started in 2005 that has since 
exploded with video clips from all corners of the 
globe.
Everything’s Coming Up Videos
Movies, TV shows, and music videos are easy to 
locate and play. Videos you purchase from the iTunes 
Store are ready to use, but videos you bring in from 
other sources may have to be converted first by iTunes 
to for use on your iPod touch. You can tell if a video needs 
to be converted by selecting the video in iTunes and checking the 
Advanced menu: The Create iPod or iPhone version option is grayed out. 
To convert a video, select the video and choose Advanced➪Create iPod or 
iPhone Version. 

112

To find out more about why videos need to be converted and how to 
prepare your own videos and convert imported videos for use with an iPod 
touch, visit the Tony’s Tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com/
tonytips).
To locate and play a video on your iPod touch, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Videos icon on the iPod touch Home screen.
 
2. Scroll the Videos screen to see the sections for Movies, TV Shows, 
Music Videos, and Podcasts (video podcasts only).
 
 The video titles are listed in alphabetical order within these sections.
 
3. Tap the title of an item to play it.
Playback under your thumb
Tap the screen to show video controls (as shown in Figure 8-1). You can tap 
again to hide them.
Tap the Play/Pause button while a video is playing to pause the playback. To 
raise or lower the volume, drag the volume slider. (See Figure 8-1.)
You can fast-forward 
through a video by touch-
ing and holding down 
the Next/Fast-Forward 
button, and you can 
rewind a video by touch-
ing and holding down the 
Previous/Rewind button. 
To skip to any point in a 
video, drag the playhead 
along the scrubber bar. 
To start a video over from 
the beginning, drag the 
playhead on the scrub-
ber bar all the way to the 
left or tap the Previous/
Rewind button (if the 
video doesn’t contain 
chapters).

 Chapter 8: Bring Videos, Books, and Podcasts
 
If the video does contain chapters, you can skip to the previous or next 
chapter by tapping the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast-Forward button. To 
start playing at a specific chapter, tap the bullet-list button that appears in 
the top-right corner — but remember, this trick works only if the original 
video was set up to contain chapters.
To stop watching a video before it finishes playing, tap the Done button in 
the upper-left corner of the display or press the Home button on the device. 
If a video offers an alternative audio language or subtitles, a Subtitles button 
appears. Tap the Subtitles button and then choose a language from the Audio 
list, or a language from the Subtitles list, or tap On to turn off subtitles.
Videos are automatically set to remember the playback position when you 
pause. This feature lets you pause a video or TV episode in iTunes while 
you synchronize your iPod touch. After syncing, you can continue playing 
the video or episode on your iPod touch from where you paused. This fea-
ture also works the opposite way: If you start playing a video on your iPod 
touch and then pause, and then you sync it with iTunes, the video retains 
the playback position so that you can continue playing it in iTunes from 
where you paused.
 
You can delete a video directly from your iPod touch by flicking left or right 
across the video selection in the Videos menu and then tapping the Delete 
button that appears. Your video is still in iTunes but is deleted from the iPod 
touch — you can sync the iPod touch again and copy the video back to it (as 
I explain in Chapter 5). If you delete a rented movie from the iPod touch, it’s 
deleted permanently. 
Scaling the picture
Videos are displayed in landscape mode in widescreen format. You can also 
scale the video picture to fill the screen or to fit within the screen. Tap the 
Scale button (the one with two arrows facing away from each other — refer 
to Figure 8-1) or double-tap the video picture itself to switch from one to 
the other.
Filling the screen may crop the sides, top, and bottom to give you a larger 
view of the center of the picture. Fitting to the screen assures that the 
entire picture is shown, but you may see black bars on the sides or top and 
bottom.

YouTube in Your Hand
The newest and most popular videos 
in YouTube are right in your hand. 
All you need to do is connect by 
Wi-Fi. (See Chapter 4 to set up Wi-Fi.) 
You can search for and play videos, 
bookmark favorites for later play-
back, and share videos with others 
by e-mail.
Tap YouTube on the Home screen to 
run the YouTube app. If this is your 
first visit to the YouTube app, the 
Featured screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 8-2. Otherwise, the screen 
you were viewing when you last used 
the app appears.
You can tap icons along the bottom 
of the display to get to other screens, 
such as Most Viewed, as shown in 
Figure 8-3, which offers buttons at 
the top for today’s most-viewed 
videos, the faves for this week, and 
all of the most-viewed videos.
After you’ve saved your favorites as 
bookmarks (see the “Bookmarking and sharing” section later in this chapter), 
you can go right to your favorite videos by tapping the Favorites icon. Tap 
the More icon to see even more screens, including Top Rated (the best of 
the best), Most Recent (the most recent videos added), and History (all the 
videos you’ve played so far). You can also tap the Sign In button to sign into 
your YouTube account and access the My Videos section of your account.
 
The History screen offers a Clear button so that you can clear your history at 
any time.
Running down a stream: Playback control
Tap a selection to play the video. YouTube streams the video to your iPod 
touch — sending it bit by bit — so that you can start playing it immediately. 
Tap the video picture to see the controls (see Figure 8-4), which are exactly 
like the video controls described in the previous section. The progress of the 
downloaded stream appears in the scrubber bar. Even though you can play

the video as it streams, you might want to pause it for a few seconds so that 
more of the stream is downloaded. You can then play the video without any 
hiccups.
Bookmarking and sharing
YouTube offers a couple of handy 
buttons on its videos (see Figure 8-4 
for both buttons):
 
✓ Bookmark button (a book 
icon): This button appears to 
the left of the Previous/Rewind 
button, and you can use it to 
bookmark the video so that 
you can easily find it on the 
Favorites screen. 
 
✓ Share button (an envelope 
icon): This button is located 
to the right of the Next/Fast-
Forward button. Tap it to bring 
up the e-mail sending screen 
to share the video with others 
via e-mail — see Chapter 11 for 
details on how to fill out the 
e-mail message. 
Tap the Bookmark button to save a 
bookmark for the video — the video 
selection appears in the Favorites 
screen, which you can access later 
by tapping the Favorites icon in the 
bottom row. (The Bookmark button 
is gray rather than white if the video 
is already bookmarked.)
You can also bookmark or share the 
video without playing it, and you 
can even view information about the 
video as well as related video selec-
tions. Tap the right-arrow button 
on the right side of each selection 
(refer to Figure 8-3) to see informa-
tion about the video and to use the 
Bookmark or Share buttons.

To delete entries from your Favorites screen, tap the Favorites icon at the 
bottom of the display to show your bookmarked favorites, then tap the Edit 
button in the top-right corner of the screen. The Favorites screen changes 
to include circled minus (–) signs next to the video selections. To delete a 
bookmarked video selection, tap the circled minus sign, which then rotates 
and displays a Delete button over the selection — tap the Delete button. 
To cancel deletion, tap the rotated circled minus sign again. Tap the Done 
button in the top-right corner of the Favorites screen to finish editing.
Searching for videos
To search for videos on YouTube, 
tap the Search icon in the bottom 
row of icons. Then tap the Search 
Entry field that appears at the top of 
the screen. The onscreen keyboard 
pops up, ready for your search 
term. (For instructions on using the 
onscreen keyboard, see Chapter 2.) 
If the entry field already has a search 
term, tap the circled x in the right 
corner of the field to clear its con-
tents. Then tap out the letters of 
the search term using the onscreen 
keyboard and tap the Search key 
on the keyboard. Immediately after 
tapping Search, video selections 
from YouTube appear below, as 
shown in Figure 8-5 (in which I type 
just u2 to get the latest U2 music

All you have to do is stream
If you’re a stream lover (like I am), YouTube isn’t 
nearly enough. You can find streaming Web 
radio stations and video streams on the Web 
using apps such as Pandora (radio stations), 
CBS Sports (live games), and Truveo (TV sta-
tions). Your iPod touch needs to be connected 
to Wi-Fi and the Internet to stream video — see 
Chapter 4 to get set up.
Pandora lets you type the name of an artist, 
song, or composer, and Pandora creates a 
custom station that streams to your iPod touch 
the music you chose — and more music like it. 
You can touch the thumbs-up or -down buttons 
to let Pandora know your musical tastes. 
CBS Sports NCAA March Madness on Demand 
streams live video of every game from the NCAA 
Division I Men’s Basketball Championship. 
And with Truveo, it’s easy to search for stream-
ing video across sites that include NBC, CNN, 
The Disney Channel, HBO, Discovery Channel, 
Comedy Central, PBS, MTV, The Wall Street 
Journal, YouTube, and Dailymotion, and browse 
featured videos, top searches, channels, or cat-
egories. My favorite feature of Truveo is that it 
lets me look up the most Twittered videos of 
the day.

Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
One Chapter at a Time: Audio 
Books and Podcasts
Audio books are, naturally, organized into chapters or parts. Podcasts are 
also organized into parts, called episodes, and both play the same way. The 
audio book title or podcast name and episode appear on your iPod touch 
display along with its cover — similar to a book or album cover. 
After syncing your audio books and podcast episodes along with the rest of 
your content (as I describe in glorious detail in Chapter 5), you can find them 
in the Music screen: Tap the Music icon on the Home screen and then tap 
the More icon at the bottom-right corner of the Music screen to see the More 
screen.
Tap Audiobooks on the More screen and then scroll the Audiobooks screen 
to select and play an audio book. Tap an audio book on the Audiobooks 
screen that appears and then tap a chapter or part to play it, starting from 
that point. The audio book chapters or parts are listed in proper order for 
each book.
Tap Podcasts on the More screen and then scroll the Podcasts screen to 
select and play a podcast episode. Podcasts are organized by podcast name 
(which is like an album name), and episodes are listed within each podcast in 
the order that they were released (by date). A blue dot appears next to any 
podcast that has unplayed episodes. 
You control the playback of an audio book or podcast episode exactly the 
same way as a song (see Chapter 7) — you can pause playback by tapping 
the Play/Pause button, and so on. You can control video podcasts the same 
way you control videos. (See the section “Everything’s Coming Up Videos” in 
this chapter.)
Audio books and podcasts are automatically set to remember the playback 
position when you pause. If you pause playback on your iPod touch and then 
sync with iTunes, you can resume playback at that position on either the 
iPod touch or in iTunes.

In This Chapter
▶ Synchronizing photo albums
▶ Showing off your photos
▶ Playing slideshows
T
he world is awash in images, from photos and video stills to cartoons 
and famous paintings. If you like to send and receive images by e-mail, 
you’re going to love the fact that you can now use your iPod touch to share 
some of the 25,000 images it can hold. This chapter shows you how.
Syncing with Photo Albums and Folders
After importing photos from cameras into your computer, 
you can organize them into albums or collections. On 
a Mac, you can use iPhoto (version 4.0.3 or newer) 
or Aperture. Newer versions of iPhoto let you orga-
nize photos by events as well as in albums. On 
a Windows PC you can use Adobe Photoshop 
Album (version 2.0 or newer) or Adobe Photoshop 
Elements (version 3.0 or newer). 
You can then set up your iPod touch to sync with 
your entire photo library or with specific albums 
in your library so that any changes you make to the 
library or to those photo albums are copied to the 
iPod touch. In addition, any images you collect from 
e-mails on your iPod touch are synced back to the photo 
library on your computer.
If you don’t have these applications, you can use any other photo-editing or 
photo-organizing software and store your photos in their own folder on your 
hard drive (such as the Pictures folder in your user’s folder on a Mac, or the 

120
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
My Pictures folder in your My Documents folder in Windows). You can then 
use iTunes to transfer photos from this folder, treating the folder as a single 
photo album.
 
If you want photos in a folder to appear in multiple photo albums on your 
iPod touch, use the Finder (on a Mac) or Windows Explorer (in Windows) to 
create subfolders inside the folder and organize your photos and image files 
inside these subfolders. iTunes copies the subfolder assignments as if they 
were album assignments. This technique is useful for Adobe Photoshop users 
who set up Adobe Bridge to organize images.
 
To find out more about organizing photos into albums, visit the Tony’s Tips 
section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com/tonytips).
Putting images on the iPod touch
To copy images from your computer to your iPod touch using iTunes, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Connect your iPod touch to your computer and then select the iPod 
touch name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the Summary page (under the Summary tab of the 
device’s synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane. (See 
Chapter 5 for details.)
 
2. Click the Photos tab.
 
 The Photos sync options appear, as shown in Figure 9-1.
 
3. Select the Sync Photos From check box and then pick the source of 
your photos from the pop-up menu: a photo application, the Pictures 
(Mac) or My Pictures (PC) folder, or the Choose Folder option.
 
 Pick your photo application (such as iPhoto on a Mac, or Adobe 
Photoshop Album in Windows) from the pop-up menu to synchronize 
with its library. If you don’t use these applications, pick the Pictures 
folder on a Mac or the My Pictures folder on a PC. If you don’t use those 
folders for your images, pick Choose Folder to use the Mac’s Open 
dialog or the PC’s Windows Explorer window to browse your hard drive 
or other storage media for the folder containing images. After selecting 
the folder, click Choose (Mac) or OK (Windows).
 
4. If you chose a photo application that organizes photos by album, col-
lection, or events, or if you stored images in subfolders in your image 
folder, select one of the following options below the Sync Photos From 
check box:
 
• All Photos and Albums: Copies all photos and albums (or collec-
tions) from the library or folder selected in Step 3.

121
 Chapter 9: Your Pocket Picture Player
 
Figure 9-1: Sync your iPod touch with photo albums.
 
• Events: If you chose a photo application that organizes photos by 
events (such as iPhoto), you can select All (for all events) or the 
name of an event from the pop-up menu for the Events option.
 
• Selected Albums: Lets you choose which photo albums from the 
library (or subfolders from the folder) selected in Step 3 you want 
to copy. The idea here is to scroll the list box to see all the photo 
albums or collections in your library (or subfolders in your folder) 
and then select the check box next to each one you want to copy. (In 
Figure 9-1, you can see that I decided to copy the subfolders named 
John and Jimi2 and Rick Wedding from the My Pictures folder.)
 
5. Click the Apply button to apply changes and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
 iTunes copies the photo library or albums you selected to your iPod 
touch (and deletes all other photos from the iPod touch).
 
No matter what photo application you use, you can save photos as image 
files in a folder on your hard drive and then bring them into your iPod touch 
whenever you want. It’s rare for an iPod touch to meet an image file format it 
doesn’t like. On a Mac, you can use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), Pict, PNG, PSD 
(Photoshop), PDF, jpg 2000, SGI, and BMP. In Windows, you can use JPEG 
(JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), PNG, and BMP.

122
Part III: Playing It Back with Interest 
Syncing recently saved images
You can save images that you receive via e-mail on your iPod touch — and 
even save screen shots of the iPod touch screen — in a special photo album 
on your iPod touch called Saved Images. (I describe how to save images and 
screen shots later in this chapter.)
To synchronize these new images back to your computer, connect your iPod 
touch to your computer as you normally would to sync it.
On a Mac, iPhoto pops up automatically — click the Import All button, or 
select the pictures you want and click the Import Selected button. After 
importing the pictures into the iPhoto library, iPhoto asks whether you want 
to delete the original pictures from the iPod touch. Click Delete Originals 
to delete the images from the iPod touch (they’re safe in your photo library 
now) or click Keep Originals to save them on your iPod touch — in case 
you want to sync them with another computer’s photo library. (If you use 
Aperture rather than iPhoto, you can select the project or folder you want to 
put the photos in before syncing.)
On a Windows PC, follow the instructions that came with your photo applica-
tion to import the photos from a digital camera or use the Microsoft Scanner 
and Camera Wizard, which saves the images to a folder of your choice. 
(The iPod touch can trick your PC into thinking it’s a digital camera.) Most 
applications also provide an option to delete the photos from the camera 
(the iPod touch) after importing.
Viewing Images
To view photos and other images on your iPod touch, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Photos icon on the Home screen.
 
 The Photo Albums screen appears, as shown in Figure 9-2 (left side), with 
a list of photo albums — including Saved Photos if you’ve already saved 
photos or images from e-mail messages received on your iPod touch. 
 
2. Tap a photo album’s name (or the arrow to the right of the name) or 
tap Photo Library to see all images. 
 
 Thumbnail images appear, as shown in Figure 9-2 (right side). The Photo 
Library choice displays thumbnails of all the photos and images in your 
iPod touch. Selecting an album (as I do in Figure 9-2) displays thumb-
nails of only the photos and images assigned to that album.

123
 Chapter 9: Your Pocket Picture Player
 
3. Flick your finger to scroll the thumbnails and tap a thumbnail to select 
a photo.
 
 You might have several screens of thumbnails. Flick your finger to scroll 
the thumbnails and tap one to select it and view it. 
 
 
Figure 9-2: Tap a photo album or the entire photo library (left) and then 
 
tap a thumbnail image (right).
To view a photo in landscape orientation, rotate the iPod touch sideways. 
The photo automatically changes to fit the new orientation, and expands to 
fit the screen if the photo itself is in landscape orientation.
To zoom into the photo to see more detail, double-tap the area you want to 
zoom into. Double-tap again to zoom out. You can also zoom into an area 
by unpinching with two fingers, and zoom out by pinching. To pan around a 
photo, drag the photo with your finger.
To move to the next photo in the library, flick horizontally across the photo 
with your finger. You can flick across to go backward or forward through the 
album or the entire library.
Tap the full-screen photo to show or hide the navigation controls, as shown 
in Figure 9-3. You can see the next or previous photos in the album or library 
by tapping the Previous or the Next buttons that appear when you tap the 
photo display.

On with the Slideshow
Slideshows are an especially entertaining way of showing photos because 
you can include music as well as transitions between photos. You can 
display your slideshow on the iPod touch or on a television by connecting 
your iPod touch to the TV using the Universal Dock, Component AV Cable, 
or Composite AV Cable from Apple (available in the Apple Store). 
Setting up a slideshow
To set up a slideshow, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪Photos from 
the Home screen.
 
 The Photos Slideshow Settings 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-4.
 
2. Tap the Play Each Slide For 
option to set the duration of 
each slide.
 
 You can select ranges from 2 to 
20 seconds. 
 
3. Tap the Transition option

Sharing Images
What good is it to collect pictures 
without sharing them with other 
people? You can share images in 
your iPod touch by sending one or 
more in an e-mail, uploading as many 
as you want to social networks, and 
sharing entire photo albums using 
MobileMe.

Chapter 11.
 
You can also use the Options menu 
to assign the photo to a contact in 
your Contacts list (see Chapter 13 for 
details) or use the image as the iPod 
touch wallpaper (see Chapter 3) as 
well as sharing it with others using 
MobileMe (see “Sharing photo 
albums” later in this section).
Selecting and copying multiple images
To select more than one image to copy and paste into another app or to 
share by e-mail, tap the Photos icon on the Home screen, tap a photo album 
or Photo Library (refer to Figure 9-2, left side) and then 
tap the Selection button in the bottom-left corner of the thumbnail images 
(refer to Figure 9-2, right side). The Select Photos screen appears, showing 
the same thumbnails. Tap each thumbnail in the Select Photos screen, as 
shown in Figure 9-6 (left side), to select each image. As you tap each thumb-
nail, a check mark appears in the thumbnail to indicate that it is part of the 
selection. 
To e-mail the images, tap the Share button, and then tap Email. The Mail app 
launches and starts a new e-mail message that includes all of the selected 
images (see Chapter 11 for details on sending e-mails). 
Figure 9-5: Choose the option to e-mail the 
photo.

127
 Chapter 9: Your Pocket Picture Player
To copy the images to another app or paste them in an existing message, 
tap the Copy button to copy the images. You can paste the images into any 
app that accepts pasted images — such as a saved e-mail draft message in 
Mail. Touch and hold to mark an insertion point in the e-mail message (which 
brings up the keyboard), so that the Select/Select All/Paste bubble appears, 
as shown in Figure 9-6 (right side). Tap Paste to paste the images into the 
message.
 
 
Figure 9-6: Select images for copying or sharing (left), and paste the images

Sharing photo albums
If you’ve set up a photo album on MobileMe to share with others, you can 
include any image in your iPod touch in this published album so that others 
can immediately see it. Tap the Options button as described earlier in the 
“Sending an image by e-mail” section and then tap the Send to MobileMe 
button. The iPod touch contacts MobileMe over Wi-Fi and displays a list of 
the photo albums you’ve published on MobileMe to share with others. Select 
the album to include the image.
You can also share images using services such as Facebook and MySpace — 
both offer iPod touch apps that let you upload images from your iPod touch. 
See Chapter 13 for a sociable description.
Capturing a screen shot
You too can capture shots of the iPod touch screen and display them in a 
book or Web site, just as I have. No matter what application you’re running, 
quickly press and release the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same 
time. The iPod touch screen flashes (and if your volume is up, you can hear a 
shutter click). This indicates that the screen was saved in the Saved Images 
album — choose the album in Photos to see the image. You can take as many 
screen shots as you like. The next time you sync your iPod touch to your 
computer, your photo application (such as iPhoto) launches to receive these 
new images.

Part IV
Touching the 
Online World

T
he iPod was always in a class by itself as a 
media player. But the iPod touch takes the 
concept of playing media to an entirely new level 
by providing access to the world of online con-
tent. Now you can visit Web sites around the 
world, download songs, play YouTube videos, 
check your e-mail, and even monitor your stock 
portfolio.
Chapter 10 spins the Web and shows you how to 
surf Web pages with Safari. You discover how to 
search with Google or Yahoo! and interact with 
Web services to do everything from checking live 
news feeds to making travel reservations.
Next, in Chapter 11, you ﬁ nd out how to turn your 
iPod touch into a lean, clean, e-mail machine. You 
can check e-mails from multiple e-mail accounts, 
send messages, and manage your e-mail settings.
Then, in Chapter 12, the weather becomes more 
predictable, your stocks proudly show their 
charts, and the Earth itself reveals its secrets in 
satellite and map views — all on your iPod touch.

Surfin’ Safari
In This Chapter
▶ Browsing the Web with your iPod touch
▶ Navigating, scrolling, and zooming into Web pages
▶ Saving and using Web page bookmarks
▶ Saving Web site icons to your Home screen
T
he World Wide Web makes the world go ’round a whole lot faster than 
ever before. I browse the Web for many different kinds of content and 
services. It’s gotten to the point where I now make travel, restaurant, and 
entertainment reservations, and I purchase everything on the Web, from 
music, videos, books, and clothing to electronics equipment, garden sup-
plies, groceries, and furniture. I get to track my shipments and purchases, 
review the latest news, check up on the blogs of my friends and 
associates, read novels, view slide shows and movies posted 
on the Internet, and even scan text messages from cell 
phones — all thanks to the Internet.
I can do all this on my iPod touch, using the Safari 
browser with a Wi-Fi connection, so I rarely need a 
laptop when I travel. I can also search using Google 
or Yahoo! — both services are built into Safari, and 
you can always browse any other search site. 
The iPod touch connects to the Internet through 
Wi-Fi networks. It can join AirPort and other Wi-Fi 
networks at home, at work, or at Wi-Fi hotspots 
around the world, as I describe in Chapter 4. 
Take a Walk on the Web Side with Safari
Safari on the iPod touch not only lets you browse through Web sites but 
also lets you add bookmarks and icons to your Home screen for convenient 
access. (You can also synchronize those bookmarks with your computer’s 
Web browser, as I describe in Chapter 6.)

132
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
Go URL own way
It’s a snap to browse any Web site. Just tap out the site’s address on the 
onscreen keyboard. (For instructions on using the onscreen keyboard, see 
Chapter 2.) 
 
The Web site address is known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and usu-
ally begins with http://www. followed by the name of the Web site or other 
characters (such as http://www.apple.com or http://www.tonybove.
com/tonytips). However, you can leave off the http://www. part and just 
go with the rest of the characters of the URL (apple.com or tonybove.com/
tonytips).
For the blow-by-blow 
account, check out the 
following steps:
 
1. Tap the Safari icon 
on the Home screen.
 
 The iPod touch dis-
plays the last Web 
page you visited or 
a blank page, with 
the rectangular URL 
entry field at the 
top-left corner and 
an oval search entry 
field in the top-right 
corner, as shown in 
Figure 10-1. (If you 
don’t see these two 
entry fields side by 
side, tap the status 
bar at the top of the 
screen to jump to the 
top of the Web page.)
 
2. Tap the URL field. 
 
 The onscreen key-
board appears. Above 
that is an entry field 
for typing the URL. 
 
3. If the entry field 
already has a 
URL, tap the 
circled x in the right 
corner of the field to 
clear its contents.
URL Entry

Navigation bar
Figure 10-1: The URL and search fields appear at the top 
of the Web page in Safari.

 Chapter 10: Surfin’ Safari
 
4. Tap out the URL for the Web page using the onscreen keyboard.
 
 Immediately as you start typing the characters of the URL, you see a list 
of suggested Web sites in your bookmarks or history list that match the 
characters you typed so far (as shown in Figure 10-2). You can scroll 
the suggested list by dragging up and down. If the Web site you want 
appears, tap it to go directly to the site without further ado. Otherwise, 
keep typing the URL, including the extension — the keyboard includes a 
.com button, next to the Go button, for your convenience.
 
5. Tap the Go button on the 
keyboard (or tap Cancel to 
cancel).
 
 When you tap the Go button, 
your iPod touch closes the 
keyboard, displays the mes-
sage Loading in the status bar, 
and loads the Web page from 
the Internet, if the page exists. 
If you mistyped the URL or 
the page doesn’t exist, you get 
the message Safari can’t 
open the page because it 
can’t find the server. 
Tap OK and start again from 
Step 2.
 
 To cancel entering a URL, tap 
the Cancel button in the top-
right corner of the screen 
(refer to Figure 10-2).
 
To stop a Web page from loading if 
you change your mind, tap the x on 
the right side of the URL entry field. 
This x turns into a circular arrow 
after the page is loaded. To reload 
an already loaded Web page to refresh 
its contents, tap the circular arrow.
Hanging loose with your bookmarks
If you already have bookmarks saved in your iPod touch, you can go 
directly to your favorite bookmarked pages. (To add bookmarks to your 
iPod touch, you can sync bookmarks from your computer’s Web browser, 
as described in Chapter 6, and you can also save bookmarks of pages you 
visit with your iPod touch, as described in “Bookmarking As You Go,” later 
in this chapter.)
Figure 10-2: Enter the first characters of the 
Web site’s URL, and suggestions appear below 
from your history or bookmarks.

134
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Safari icon on the Home screen.
 
 Your iPod touch displays the last Web page you visited or a blank page. 
A navigation bar sporting various icons and buttons appears along the 
bottom, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
2. Tap the Bookmarks icon — the one that looks like an open book— in 
the navigation bar.
 
 The Bookmarks screen appears with the special History folder that 
records your page visits, and other Bookmark-related folders (such as 
Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks Menu, provided with the Safari applica-
tion on Macs and PCs). You can scroll this list by dragging up and down. 
 
3. Tap a folder to view its contents.
 
 For example, tapping Bookmarks Menu opens the folders and book-
marks from the Bookmarks Menu section of Safari on your Mac or 
PC. Tapping Bookmarks Bar opens the folders and bookmarks in the 
Bookmarks Bar section. Tapping History opens the history of the Web 
pages you’ve visited.
 
4. Tap a bookmark to load the Web page.
 
 Folders have a folder icon to the left of their names, and actual book-
marks have an open-page icon next to their Web page names. Tap a 
folder to reveal its contents and tap a bookmark to load a Web page.

 Chapter 10: Surfin’ Safari
 
You can rotate the iPod touch sideways to view Web pages in landscape 
(horizontal) orientation, and then double-tap to zoom in or out — Safari auto-
matically fits sections of Web pages (such as columns of text) to fill the 
screen for easy reading. You can also spread with two fingers to control the 
amount of zooming.
Pearl diving with Google or Yahoo!
If you’ve done any Web surfing at all, you already know all there is to know 
about search engines. They’re simply the tool for finding Web sites. The two 
most popular search engines out there — Google and Yahoo! — are built into 
Safari on your iPod touch. 
 
Google is set up to be your default Web search engine, but you can quickly 
change that. To choose Yahoo! (or to go back to Google), tap Settings➪
Safari➪Search Engine, and tap Yahoo! or Google. Turning on one search 
engine turns off the other search engine.
Follow these steps to search with Google or Yahoo! from within Safari:
 
1. Tap the Safari icon on the Home screen.
 
 The iPod touch displays the last Web page you visited or a blank page. 
You can find the URL entry field in the top-left corner and the oval 
search entry field, with Google or Yahoo! in gray, in the top-right 
corner (refer to Figure 10-1). (If you don’t see these two entry fields side 
by side, tap the status bar at the top of the screen to jump to the top of 
the Web page.)
 
2. Tap the oval search entry field. 
 
 The onscreen keyboard appears. Above that is the search entry field 
(with a magnifying glass icon). 
 
3. Tap inside the search entry field.
 
4. Tap out the letters of the search term using the keyboard.
 
 Immediately as you start typing characters, you see a list of suggested 
bookmarks in your bookmarks folder or history list. You can scroll this 
list by dragging up and down. 
 
5. If a bookmark appears that satisfies your search, tap it to go directly 
to the Web page without further ado. Otherwise, keep typing the 
search term. 
 
6. Tap the Google or Yahoo! button at the bottom-right corner of the 
keyboard.
 
 Doing so closes the keyboard and displays the search results. (Note: 
The Google or Yahoo! button replaces the Go button on the keyboard 
when searching.)

136
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
Let Your Fingers Do the Surfing
After you’ve found the Web page you want, you can use your fingers to navi-
gate its links and play any media it has to offer. You can also bounce around 
from previous to next pages in your browsing session, open multiple pages, 
zoom into pages to see them clearly, and scroll around the page to see all of 
its sections while zooming.
Scrolling and zooming
To zoom into a Web page in Safari, spread two fingers apart on the screen 
(unpinch). To zoom back out, bring your fingers together (pinch).
Double-tap the display to zoom into any part of the page. You can also double-
tap a column to automatically zoom in so that the column fills the iPod touch 
display. Double-tap again to zoom back out.
To scroll around the page, touch and drag the page. (If you happen to touch 
a link, drag the link so that you don’t follow the link.) You can drag up, down, 
or sideways to see the entire Web page; or flick your finger up or down to 
quickly scroll the page. Use two fingers to scroll within the frame on a Web 
page or one finger to scroll the entire page.
 
To jump to the top of a Web page, tap the status bar at the top of the iPod 
touch screen.
All of these gestures work the same way in either portrait or landscape ori-
entation. To view a Web page in landscape orientation, rotate the iPod touch 
sideways. Safari automatically reorients and expands the page. To set it back 
to portrait, rotate the iPod touch again.
It’s all touch and go
To follow a link on a Web page, tap the link. Text links are usually underlined 
(sometimes in blue). Many images are also links you can tap to navigate to 
another page or use to play media content.
If a link leads to a sound or movie file supported by the iPod touch, Safari 
plays the sound or movie; if the link points to YouTube, the YouTube app 
launches to play the video. (See Chapter 7 for sounds and Chapter 8 for 
videos.)
 
You can see the link’s destination — without following it — by touching and 
holding down on the link until the destination address appears (next to your 
finger). You can touch and hold an image to see whether it has a link.

137
 Chapter 10: Surfin’ Safari
To move to the previous page in your browsing sequence, tap the left-arrow 
button in the left side of the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. 
(Refer to Figure 10-3.) Safari replaces the current page with the previous one. 
If you’ve just started browsing and this is the first page you’ve opened, the 
left-arrow button is grayed out.
To move to the next page, tap the right-arrow button (to the right of the left-
arrow button) in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. (Refer to 
Figure 10-3.) Safari replaces the current page with the next one in the brows-
ing sequence. This button is grayed out unless you’ve navigated backward to 
some previous page.
 
You can always go back to any of the pages you visited by tapping the 
Bookmarks button in the navigation bar and then tapping History. To clear 
your History list on your iPod touch, tap Clear.
Surfing multiple pages
Although you can open Web pages one at a time and switch back and forth 
between them, you can also open several pages and start a new browsing 
sequence with each page, just like opening separate browser windows or tabs.
Some links automatically open a new page instead of replacing the current one, 
leaving you with multiple pages open. Safari displays the number of open pages 
inside the Pages icon in the right corner of the navigation bar at the bottom of 
the screen. If there’s no number on the icon, it means only one page is open.
To open a separate page, tap the Pages icon on the right side of the navigation 
bar at the bottom of the screen; then tap the New Page button. Safari brushes 
aside the existing page to display a new one. You can then use your book-
marks, enter a Web page URL, or search for a Web page. (If you change your 
mind and don’t want to open a new page, tap the Done button to cancel.)
To close a separate page, tap the Pages icon on the right side of the naviga-
tion bar to display the page thumbnail images and then tap the red circled 
x in the top-left corner of the Web 
page thumbnail for the page you 
want to close. The page disappears.
To switch among open pages, tap 
the Pages icon to display the page 
thumbnail images, as shown in 
Figure 10-4, and flick left or right to 
scroll the images. When you get to 
the thumbnail image of the page you 
want, touch it!
Figure 10-4: Switch among open Web pages.

138
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
Interacting with pages
Many Web pages have pop-up menus for making choices. For example, the 
NextBus Stop Selector site (www.nextmuni.com) offers pop-up menus for 
selecting the state, the transit agency, and the bus line. To make choices for 
a pop-up menu, tap the menu. Safari displays a list of possible choices for 
that pop-up menu (such as a list of bus lines). Choose one by tapping it; you 
can also flick to scroll the list of choices. 
After choosing an option, tap the Done button to finish with that pop-up 
menu. You can also tap the Previous or Next buttons to move to the previous 
or next pop-up menu.
Entering text into a Web site — such 
as reservation information, pass-
words, credit card numbers, search 
terms, and so on — is as easy as 
tapping inside the text field. Safari 
brings up the keyboard, as shown 
in Figure 10-5, and you can type the 
text. You may want to rotate the iPod 
touch sideways to view Web pages in 
landscape (horizontal) orientation, 
so that the keyboard is wider and 
easier to use.
You can move to the next or 
previous text field by tapping the Next or Previous buttons or by tapping 
inside another text field. To finish typing with the keyboard, tap the Done 
button. If you don’t like what you typed, use the backspace key to delete it 
before tapping Done.
After you finish filling out all the required text fields on the page, tap Go on 
the keyboard (or tap Search, which some pages use rather than Go). If the 
Web page is a form, tapping Go automatically submits the form. Some Web 
pages offer a link for submitting the form, which you must tap in order to 
finish entering information.
Copying text
You may want to copy one or more paragraphs of text from a Web page to 
paste into another app (such as Notes) or into an e-mail. Although you can 
e-mail a link to a Web page (as I show you in the “Sending a Web link by 
Figure 10-5: Type the text for a text field on a 
Web page.

139
 Chapter 10: Surfin’ Safari
e-mail” section in this chapter), you 
may want to copy a section of text 
and then paste the section into the 
message itself.
To copy a section of text from a Web 
page, touch and hold somewhere 
within the section (also known as a 
long tap). Safari automatically high-
lights the section with selection 
handles on either end, and it displays 
the Copy bubble (see Figure 10-6). 
Tap Copy to copy the selection.
If you zoomed into the Web page and 
the long tap selects only a single word, try zooming out first (pinching) and 
then trying the long tap (touch and hold) again. You can also make a more 
precise selection by dragging one of the handles. A rectangular magnifier 
appears for dragging the handle precisely. After you remove your finger to 
stop dragging, the Copy bubble appears.
For details on pasting the selected text into apps such as Notes or into an 
e-mail, see Chapter 2.
Bookmarking As You Go
The best way to keep track of Web pages you’ve visited and want to visit 
again is to create bookmarks for the pages. You can then quickly go back 
to that page by selecting the bookmark. The bookmarks in your iPod touch 
synchronize with your Safari bookmarks on your Mac, or with your Safari or 
Internet Explorer bookmarks on your PC, as I describe in Chapter 6.
Saving a bookmark
Follow these steps to save a bookmark:
 
1. Browse to the Web page you want.
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the middle of the navigation bar (refer to 
Figure 10-3).
Figure 10-6: Copy a selected section of text on 
a Web page.

140
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
 
 The special options menu 
appears, as shown in Figure 10-7, 
with the Add Bookmark, Add to 
Home Screen, Mail Link to this 
Page, and Cancel buttons. 
 
3. Tap the Add Bookmark button 
to add a bookmark.
 
 The name of the Web site 
appears in the title field, ready 
for editing, along with the 
onscreen keyboard. Below 
that is the actual URL for the 
Web page, and below that, the 
Bookmarks folder.
 
4. (Optional) Edit the bookmark’s 
title.
 
 Before saving a bookmark, 
you can edit its title with the 
onscreen keyboard. Tap the 
circled x on the right side of the 
title field to clear its contents, 
or use the backspace key on the 
keyboard to erase backward 
from the end of the title, and 
type the new title.
 
5. (Optional) Choose a bookmark folder.
 
 Before saving a bookmark, you can choose a bookmark folder for saving 
it; otherwise Safari saves the bookmark in the topmost level of book-
marks. Tap Bookmarks to see the list of bookmark folders — you can 
flick to scroll the list quickly, or drag it slowly. Select a bookmark folder 
by touching it.
 
6. Tap the Save button to save the bookmark or tap Cancel to cancel.
 
 The Save button appears in the upper-right corner of the display, and 
the Cancel button appears in the upper-left corner.
You can also edit your bookmarks and bookmark folders. Tap the Bookmarks 
button in the navigation bar and choose the folder to edit or the folder that 
has the bookmark you want to edit. Then tap the Edit button in the bottom-
left corner of the screen. The Edit Bookmarks display appears, with circled 
minus (–) signs next to the bookmark folders.
Figure 10-7: Tap the plus (+) sign for the special 
options menu.

141
 Chapter 10: Surfin’ Safari
You can then do any of the following:
 
✓ To make a new folder within the selected folder, tap New Folder. If you 
want to create a new folder at the topmost level, first tap the Bookmarks 
button in the upper-left corner to go back to the topmost Bookmarks 
list, tap the Edit button, and then tap New Folder.
 
✓ To delete a bookmark or folder, tap next to the bookmark or folder and 
then tap Delete.
 
✓ To reposition a bookmark or folder, drag next to the item you want 
to move.
 
✓ To edit the name of a bookmark or folder, tap the bookmark or folder 
and use the onscreen keyboard to type the new title. (Tap the circled x 
in the title field to clear its contents first, if you want.)
 
✓ To change where a bookmark or folder is stored, tap the Bookmark 
Folder field for the selected bookmark or folder and then tap a new 
folder to hold the folder chosen for editing.
Tap the Done button in the bottom-left corner of the Edit Bookmarks display 
to finish editing.
Sending a Web link by e-mail
As I describe in Chapter 11, your iPod touch can send e-mail as well as 
receive it, as long as it’s connected to a Wi-Fi network that’s connected to 
the Internet. And if you want to share a Web page you just found with your 
friend, the steps are simple:
 
1. Browse to the Web page and then tap the plus (+) sign in the middle of 
the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. (Refer to Figure 10-3.) 
 
 A special options menu magically pops up from the bottom (refer to 
Figure 10-7), with the Add Bookmark, Add to Home Screen, and Mail Link 
to This Page buttons, along with a Cancel button.
 
2. Tap the Mail Link to this Page button.
 
 Keep in mind that you must have already set up an e-mail account on 
your iPod touch, as I describe in Chapter 6.
 
 An e-mail message appears, ready for you to finish composing. The 
Subject field is already filled in with the Web page name, and the link 
itself is already inserted in the body of the message. The To and Cc 
fields are left blank — ready for you to fill in.

3. Tap the circled plus (+) sign on the right side of the To field to select 
a name from your Contacts list, or use the onscreen keyboard to enter 
the e-mail address. 
 
 See Chapter 11 for details on sending an e-mail.
 
4. Tap Send at the top-right corner of the display to send the message.
Bringing It All Back Home
You can add Web thumbnail icons for your favorite Web pages to the Home 
screen so that you can access the page with one touch. Web icons appear 
on the Home screen along with the icons of other apps. (Discover how 
to rearrange the icons and add multiple screens to the Home screen in 
Chapter 2.)
Follow these steps to add a Web site to your Home screen:
 
1. Browse to the Web page you want.
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the middle of the navigation bar.
 
 The special options menu appears, with Add Bookmark, Add to Home 
Screen, Mail Link to this Page, and Cancel buttons (refer to Figure 10-7). 
 
3. Tap the Add to Home Screen button.
 
 The name of the Web site appears in the title field, ready for editing, 
along with the keyboard. The icon to be added to the Home screen — a 
thumbnail image of the site, or a graphic image defined by the site for 
this purpose (usually a logo) — appears to the left of the title field.
 
4. (Optional) Edit the Web icon’s title.
 
 Before saving a Web icon to the Home screen, you can edit its title with 
the keyboard. Tap the circled x on the right side of the title field to clear 
its contents, or you can use the backspace key on the keyboard to erase 
backward from the end of the title and then type the new title.
 
5. Tap the Add button to add the Web site icon, or tap Cancel to cancel.
 
 The Add button appears in the upper-right corner of the display, and the 
Cancel button appears in the upper-left corner.

▶ Checking and sending e-mail with an iPod touch
▶ Changing message settings and sending options
▶ Setting the Push and Fetch features for optimal e-mail retrieval
Your e-mail is just a touch away. The Mail app on your iPod touch can 
display richly formatted messages, and you can send as well as receive 
photos and graphics, which are displayed in your message along with the 
text. You can even receive Portable Document Format (PDF) files, Microsoft 
Word documents, and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as attachments and view 
them on your iPod touch.
The Mail app on your iPod touch can work in the background to 
retrieve your e-mail when you’re connected to Wi-Fi. If you 
signed up for Apple’s MobileMe service (formerly the .Mac 
service, now www.me.com), as I describe in illustrious 
detail in Chapter 6, your iPod touch receives e-mail 
the instant it arrives in the mailbox on the MobileMe 
service. Services such as MobileMe, Microsoft 
Exchange, and Yahoo! Mail push e-mail messages to 
your iPod touch so that they arrive immediately, 
automatically. You get a single beep when your 
mail has arrived (unless you turned off the New 
Mail sound, as I describe in Chapter 3).
Other types of e-mail account services let you 
fetch e-mail from the server — when you select the 
account in Mail on your iPod touch, Mail automatically 
starts fetching the e-mail, and you can browse your e-mail 
accounts or even use other apps while Mail fetches messages. 
You can also tell Mail to fetch more messages by tapping the Fetch 
(circular arrow) icon on the lower-left corner of the Mail, Mailboxes, or 
message screens.

144
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
Checking E-Mail
 
 You know that you have unread e-mail if the Mail icon on the iPod touch Home 
screen shows a number — this is the number of unread messages in your 
inboxes. As e-mail is pushed (or fetched) to your iPod touch, this number 
increases until you read the messages. Tap the Mail icon to start the Mail app. 
If you’ve set up an e-mail account, a list of mailboxes appears for that 
account, as shown in Figure 11-1 (left side). If you’ve set up more than one 
e-mail account, Mail displays the Accounts screen, listing the e-mail accounts 
you synchronized with your iPod touch (see Figure 11-1, middle). Tap an 
account in the Accounts screen to view the mailboxes for that account (see 
Figure 11-1, right side). (See Chapter 6 for details on synchronizing, setting 
up, deleting, and changing settings for e-mail accounts.)
 
 
Figure 11-1: A MobileMe account’s mailboxes (left); multiple e-mail accounts (middle), and 
 
the mailbox (Inbox) of an AOL e-mail account (right).
Next, tap Inbox in the list of mailboxes. A list of incoming message headers 
appears, as shown in Figure 11-2, with the sender’s name, subject, and the 
first sentence or two of each message, along with a blue dot if the message 
hasn’t been read yet.
The message is the medium
Tap a message header to read the message. You can scroll the message by 
flicking or dragging your finger, and zoom into and out of the message by 
unpinching and pinching with your fingers. You can also zoom directly into 
a column in the message by double-tapping the message, and zoom out by 
double-tapping it again.

145
 Chapter 11: The Postman Always Beeps Once
If the e-mail includes an attachment, 
a button appears within the message 
showing the icon of an attached 
file and a right arrow, as shown in 
Figure 11-3 (left side) — to view the 
attachment, just tap the right arrow. 
If the format of the attached file is 
one of the supported formats (which 
include files that have the extensions 
.doc, .docx, .htm, .html, .pdf, 
.txt, .xls, or .xlsx), Mail down-
loads and opens the attachment as 
shown in Figure 11-3 (right side); if 
not, Mail displays a document icon 
with the name of the file — but you 
can’t open it.
You can see all the recipients of a 
message (except Bcc, or blind carbon 
copy, recipients) by opening the 
message and tapping the blue word 
Details in the top-right corner of 
the message. Tap a name or e-mail 
address that appears to see the 
recipient’s contact information. Tap 
Hide to hide the recipients.
 
You can add the sender or recipient to your Contacts list on your iPod touch 
by tapping the name or e-mail address. A screen appears with the Email, 
Create New Contact, and Add to Existing Contact buttons. Tap Create New 
Contact to create a new contact (or tap Add to Existing Contact if you want to 
add the information to an existing contact). Tap the Email button to send an 
e-mail to that recipient’s address. (See the “Sending E-Mail” section, later in 
this chapter.) 
Links appear in a message underlined in blue, and images embedded in the 
message may also have links. Tapping a link can take you to a Web page in 
Safari, open a map in Maps, or open a new pre-addressed e-mail message in 
Mail. To return to your e-mail, press the Home button on your device and tap 
the Mail icon.
 
You can mark a message as unread so that it stays in your Inbox: Open the 
message, tap the blue word Details in the top-right corner, and tap the blue 
Mark as Unread text next to the blue dot inside the message. The message is 
marked as unread — a blue dot appears next to the message header in the 
mailbox list until you open it again.
Figure 11-2: Check out your incoming messages. 
A blue dot indicates an unread message.

Deleting a message
To delete an open message, tap the Trash icon at the bottom center of 
the message display. Mail deletes the message from your iPod touch (but 
not from your computer or mail server unless it’s set up that way — see 
Chapter 6) and displays the next message in sequence. You can also move 
to the previous or next message by tapping the up and down arrows in the 
top-right corner.
 
You can also delete a message without opening it. In the list of message 
headers, drag your finger across a message header and tap the Delete 
button that appears. 

147
 Chapter 11: The Postman Always Beeps Once
 
To delete a list of messages quickly, choose the mailbox (such as Inbox) and 
tap the Edit button in the top-right corner of the screen. The messages 
appear with empty circles next to them. Tap each message so that a check 
mark appears in the empty circle. After checking off the messages to delete, 
tap the Delete button in the bottom-left corner.
Sending E-Mail
You can use the Mail app to reply to any message instantly and send e-mail to 
any e-mail address in the world. You can even send a message to a group of 
people without having to select each person’s e-mail address. 
To send an e-mail, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Mail icon on the Home screen.
 
 The Accounts screen appears if you’ve set up more than one e-mail 
account, and you should look at Step 2; otherwise, the mailboxes appear 
for your account, and you can skip to Step 3.
 
2. (Optional) Choose an e-mail account from the Accounts screen for 
sending the e-mail. 
 
 You can skip this step if you have only one e-mail account. If you have 
several e-mail accounts on your iPod touch, you can select one of them, 
or you can use the default account for sending e-mail. (See the section 
“Message Settings and Sending Options,” later in this chapter, to set the 
default account.) You can also defer this decision until Step 6.
 
3. Tap the pencil-document icon in the lower-right corner of the Mail 
screen. 
 
 The New Message screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-4, along with 
the onscreen keyboard. If you have multiple accounts set up on your 
iPod touch, the default account for sending e-mail appears in the Cc/Bcc, 
From field.
 
4. Enter the recipient’s e-mail address in the To field.
 
 If your recipient is listed in your Contacts on your iPod touch, tap the 
circled plus (+) sign in the To field (see Figure 11-4) and choose a con-
tact to add the contact’s e-mail address to the To field. You can repeat 
this process to add multiple e-mail addresses to the To field from your 
contacts.
 
 If your recipient isn’t listed in your Contacts or if you don’t know 
whether the recipient is listed, tap the To field entry and use the 
keyboard to type one or more e-mail addresses (and use a comma to 

148
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
separate each address). As 
you type an e-mail address, 
e-mail addresses that match 
from your Contacts list appear 
below. Tap one to add it to the 
To field. 
 
5. (Optional) Add more addresses 
to the Cc or Bcc fields.
 
 You can add e-mail addresses 
to the Cc (carbon copy) and 
Bcc (blind carbon copy) 
fields to copy others. While 
Cc addresses appear on mes-
sages received by recipients 
indicating that they were copied 
on the message, Bcc addresses 
don’t appear on messages 
received by recipients — 
they’re like stealth readers. Tap 
the Cc/Bcc letters to expand the 
message to include the Cc and 
Bcc fields; then enter addresses 
the same way you do in Step 4.
 
6. (Optional) Change the From 
address.
 
 You can change the e-mail 
address for the sender to one of your e-mail accounts. The default e-mail 
account for sending e-mail is already selected; tap the From letters to 
display a pop-up menu of e-mail accounts and then tap an e-mail account 
to use as the sender’s account. 
 
7. Enter the e-mail subject.
 
 Tap the Subject entry field (refer to Figure 11-4) to type a subject with 
the keyboard; then tap underneath the Subject field to type a message. 
Press Return on the keyboard when you’re finished. 
 
8. Tap Send in the upper-right corner of the display (refer to Figure 11-4) 
to send the message.
Figure 11-4: The New Message screen for 
multiple accounts.

149
 Chapter 11: The Postman Always Beeps Once
You can also forward and reply to any message you receive. Open the mes-
sage and tap the curled left-arrow button that appears in the bottom-left side 
of the message display. Then tap Reply to reply to the sender of the message, 
Reply All to reply to all of the recipients as well as the sender (if there are 
other recipients), or Forward to forward the message to someone else (or 
Cancel to go back to the message). The New Message screen appears with 
the onscreen keyboard so that you can type your reply or add a message to 
the one you’re forwarding. Tap Send to send the reply or forwarded message. 
 
When you reply to a message, files or images attached to the initial message 
aren’t sent with the reply. When you tap Forward to forward a message, a 
pop-up menu with the Include or Don’t Include buttons appears for a message 
with an attachment. Tap Include to include the attachment in the forwarded 
message, or Don’t Include to forward the message without the attachment.
To save a message as a draft so you can work on it later, start typing the mes-
sage as described in the preceding steps, but before tapping Send, tap Cancel 
in the upper-left corner of the display (refer to Figure 11-4). Then, from the 
menu that appears, tap Save to save the message in your Drafts mailbox or 
tap Don’t Save to discard the message (or Cancel to go back to typing the 
message). You can find the saved message in the Drafts mailbox of the same 
e-mail account. Tap the message to add to it or change it and then send it.
 
To send a photo in a message, tap the Photos icon on the Home screen and 
choose a photo for viewing, as described in Chapter 9.
Message Settings and Sending Options
To change your e-mail message settings and sending options, choose 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen. In the Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen that appears, use your finger to scroll 
down to the Mail section to change your e-mail message settings and 
sending options, as shown in Figure 11-5.
In the Mail section, you can change global settings for messages in all 
accounts. To set the number of messages you can see at once in a mailbox, 
tap Show and then choose a setting. You can choose to see the most recent 
25, 50, 75, 100, or 200 messages. (To down-load additional messages when 
you’re in Mail, scroll to the bottom of your Inbox and tap Download More.) 

150
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
 
If you think you have shaky fingers 
and might delete a message by 
mistake, you can set Mail to confirm 
that you want to delete a message 
first before deleting. Tap the Off 
button to turn on the Ask Before 
Deleting option. (Tap it again to 
turn it off.) If Ask Before Deleting 
is on, Mail warns you first when 
you delete a message, and you 
have to tap Delete to confirm the 
deletion.
What you see is 
what you got
You can also set how many lines 
of each message are previewed in 
the message list headers. Choose 
Preview (refer to Figure 11-5) and 
then choose to see any amount from 
zero to five lines of each message. 
To set a minimum font size for mes-
sages, tap Minimum Font Size and 
then choose Small, Medium, Large, 
Extra Large, or Giant.
If you want to see all the images in your e-mails and don’t mind waiting for 
the images to download, turn on the Load Remote Images option. If you leave 
it off, your messages appear faster, but you have to touch each image icon to 
download and see it.
If you care about whether a message was sent directly to you or whether you 
were sent it as a Cc copy (which still might make it important, but at least 
you know), you can set whether Mail shows the To and Cc labels in message 
lists. Tap the Off button for the Show To/Cc Label option to turn it on. (Tap 
it again to turn it off.) If Show To/Cc Label is on, you see To or Cc in the list 
next to each message.
Return to sender, address unknown
For those who are obsessive about making sure e-mails are sent — and you 
know who you are — Mail can send you a copy of every message you send. 
Tap the Off button to turn on the Always Bcc Myself option. (Tap it again to 
Figure 11-5: The Mail section of Mail, Contacts, 
and Calendars settings.

151
 Chapter 11: The Postman Always Beeps Once
turn it off.) The Bcc refers to blind carbon copy, and it means that your mes-
sage is sent and copied back to you without your e-mail address appearing in 
the recipient’s list.
You can add a signature to your messages that can include any text — not 
your real, handwritten scrawl but rather a listing of your name, title, phone 
number, favorite quote, or all of these — to personalize your e-mails. Tap 
Signature (refer to Figure 11-5) and then type a signature with the onscreen 
keyboard. The signature remains in effect for all future e-mails sent from your 
iPod touch.
To set the default e-mail account for sending messages, tap Default Account 
(refer to Figure 11-5) and then choose an e-mail account. Your iPod touch will 
use this account whenever you start the process of sending a message from 
another application, such as sending a photo from Photos or tapping the 
e-mail address of a business in Maps.
For details on synchronizing e-mail accounts automatically from iTunes or 
MobileMe, as well as for setting up an account, changing account settings, 
and deleting accounts manually on your iPod touch, see Chapter 6.
If Not Push, Then Fetch
The Push and Fetch options control how your iPod touch receives e-mail. 
You can set these options for each account and for all accounts.
MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange, and Yahoo! Mail e-mail accounts can push 
messages to your iPod touch so that they arrive immediately after arriving at 
the account’s e-mail server. Other types of accounts fetch messages from the 
account’s e-mail server — either on a time schedule or manually. (If manu-
ally, you select the account before your iPod touch retrieves the email.) Push 
accounts (such as MobileMe email) can be set to either push or fetch.
You can turn the Push feature on or off as you please. Keeping it on uses more 
battery power because the iPod touch receives messages immediately — 
whenever it’s connected to Wi-Fi. When you turn the Push feature off, push 
accounts fetch the e-mail instead, and you can set the timetable for fetching, 
or set fetching to manual. 
 
For optimal battery life, turn Push off and set Fetch to Manually so that fetch-
ing occurs only when you tap the e-mail account to read or send e-mail. 
Pushing e-mail as it arrives, or fetching e-mail often, uses up a considerable 
amount of battery power; doing both drains the battery even more quickly.

152
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
To turn Push on or off, choose 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars 
from the Home screen and tap Fetch 
New Data. The Fetch New Data 
screen appears, as shown in Figure 
11-6. Tap the On button for Push to 
turn it off (and vice versa).
You can set a timetable for fetch-
ing e-mail automatically. Choose a 
time interval in the Fetch New Data 
screen (see Figure 11-6) — pick 
Every 15 Minutes, Every 30 Minutes, 
or Hourly. You can also pick 
Manually so that the iPod touch 
fetches only when you tap the e-mail 
account to read or send e-mail.
You can also set Push or Fetch set-
tings for individual accounts. Scroll 
the Fetch New Data screen to the 
bottom and touch Advanced. The 
Advanced screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 11-7. Each account in the 
list shows Push or Fetch, depending 
on whether the account offers push 
email or not. Tap the account 
to change its settings separately.
 
 
Figure 11-7: Choose an account (left) and set Push and Fetch settings for it (right).
Figure 11-6: Push and Fetch settings that affect 
all accounts.

 Chapter 11: The Postman Always Beeps Once
You can set a push account to use the Fetch settings in the Fetch New 
Data screen instead. You can also set a fetch account to use the Fetch 
New Data screen settings, or to fetch only manually.
 
Setting Push to Off or setting Fetch to Manually in the Fetch New Data screen 
overrides the individual account settings.

Earth, Wind, and Finance
In This Chapter
▶ Using the Maps app to find locations
▶ Getting step-by-step directions to locations
▶ Keeping track of your stock portfolio
▶ Checking the weather in various cities
Your iPod touch can find almost anything on Earth, even itself, and show 
the location on a map or satellite picture. And although you can’t har-
ness the forces of nature, or even the influences that drive Wall Street, you 
can use your iPod touch to make better guesses about the weather and the 
stock market.
This chapter describes how to use the Maps app to find any loca-
tion on Earth and obtain driving directions — without having 
to ask someone out on the street. Your iPod touch offers 
Location Services to nail down the unit’s physical loca-
tion, and it offers that information to the Maps app 
and any other app that needs it, so that you can 
instantly find out where you are in the world.
I also describe how to use the Weather and Stocks 
apps. Your iPod touch can connect to the Internet 
over Wi-Fi to get real-time information about the 
weather and the stock market. You can personalize 
the Stocks app to reflect your exact portfolio, and 
you can add cities to the Weather app to check condi-
tions before you travel to them.
Tapping Your Maps
I once had to find my way to a meeting on a university campus that I was 
already late for, and, after driving endlessly around the campus looking for 
the proper entranceway, I tapped the Maps icon on my iPod touch and was 

156
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
able to immediately look up the location, see a map of it, and get directions. 
The Maps app is that good — most paper maps aren’t even accurate for city 
streets, let alone campus driveways. (And yes, I pulled over to the curb first 
for safety.)
The Maps app provides street maps, satellite photos, and hybrid street-
satellite views of locations all over the world. It also offers detailed driving 
directions from any location to just about any other location — unless you 
can’t get there from here.
Where are you?
To use Maps, tap the Maps icon on the Home screen. The Maps app appears, 
as shown in Figure 12-1, ready for zooming, scrolling, or searching specific 
locations. 
You can zoom in to the map by 
double-tapping the map with one 
finger or unpinching with your 
fingers. To zoom out, pinch with 
your fingers or double-tap with 
two fingers. You can also drag 
the map to pan around it and see 
more areas. 
To find out where you are, tap the 
Compass icon in the bottom-left 
corner of the map screen. (See 
Figure 12-1.) A dialog appears, 
asking whether Maps can use 
your current location; tap OK to 
use it. The map then changes to 
show your general location with 
a compass-like circle representing 
your approximate physical loca-
tion, as shown in Figure 12-2. 
This circle continues to shrink as 
Maps retrieves more accurate infor-
mation. Maps figures out where you 
are by using information from some 
local Wi-Fi networks (if you have 
Wi-Fi turned on). The more accurate 
the available information, the smaller 
the circle on the map becomes.

Searching locations
To find a location and see a map, tap 
the Maps icon on the Home screen 
and then tap the Search field at the 
top of the Maps screen that appears. 
The onscreen keyboard appears so 
that you can enter information. 
You can find any location by its 
address or closest landmark, or you 
can find the physical address of a 
friend: Type the name of someone in 
your contacts list, or an address, an 
intersection, the name of a landmark 
or of a general area, or a zip code. 
For example, to search for a friend, 
start typing the person’s name. 
If the letters you type match any 
names with street addresses in your 
Contacts list, Maps offers them up 
as suggestions, as shown in Figure 
12-3. Tap a suggested name to look 
up that person’s home or business 
address.
Figure 12-3: Find the location of a friend in your 
Contacts.

158
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
 
You can also use the Contacts app to view your contacts list and then tap a 
contact’s address to see that person’s address in Maps.
To search for a landmark, an intersection, a zip code, or a type of business, 
type as much as you know into the Search field — such as 94111 pizza for 
a pizza shop in the 94111 zip code. If the landmark is well known, type its 
name, as shown in Figure 12-4. Then tap the Search key in the onscreen key-
board. A red pin appears to mark the location you’ve searched for on the 
map (see Figure 12-4, right side), with a label showing the address. 
 
To clear the entry from the Search field quickly, tap the x on the right side of 
the field. You can then type a new search term.
 
 
Figure 12-4: Type a search term and tap the Search button (left) to see 
 
the location (right).
If you search for the name of a business or type of business after searching 
for your own location, as I do in Figure 12-5, Maps is smart enough to locate 
the closest ones. Multiple pins appear on the map, showing the location of 
each business.
Pinpointing the spot
Red pins mark the locations you’ve searched for on the map (refer to Figure 
12-4 and Figure 12-5, right side), and each has a label (such as “Graceland” 
or “Starbucks”). You can also drop your own pin on the map to pinpoint 

159
 Chapter 12: Earth, Wind, and Finance
an exact spot so that you can bookmark it. The pin you drop is purple until 
you bookmark it and give it a name. (See “Bookmarking the spot,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
 
Figure 12-5: From your location, type the name of a popular business 
 
(left) to see its nearest locations (right).
To drop your own pin, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag the map to pan around and see more areas and zoom in to the 
location you want to pinpoint by double-tapping the map with one 
finger or unpinching with your fingers.
 
2. After finding the right location, tap the Underneath button — the 
curled page icon in the bottom-right corner (refer to Figure 12-1).
 
 You see a menu underneath the map, as shown in Figure 12-6 (left side).
 
3. Tap the Drop Pin button in the menu.
 
 A purple pin appears on the map with the label Drag To Move Pin 
(see Figure 12-6, center).
 
4. Touch the pin and drag it on the map to put it where you want it.
 
 You can unpinch the map to zoom in further; drag the pin to a precise 
point, such as an intersection; pinch to zoom out; and drag to pan the 
map to see other areas.

160
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
 
5. Tap the circled right arrow on the right side of the label to set the 
pin’s location and to see the Info screen (see Figure 12-6, right side). 
Then pick what you want to do next.
 
 From the Info screen, you can
 
• Get directions to or from the location (as I describe in “Getting 
directions” in this chapter).
 
• Remove the pin.
 
• Add the pin to your bookmarks (as I describe in the next section).
 
 After adding the pin to your bookmarks, it changes from purple to red. 
You can add as many pins as you want to your map and save them as 
bookmarks.
 
To see a list of all pinpointed places on your map, tap the Underneath button 
and tap List. You can then tap any location in the list to select that specific 
pin and its label.

Bookmarking the spot
It makes sense to bookmark your home, your zip code (to make it easy to find 
businesses in your area), your office, and any other locations you visit often. 
After you’ve saved bookmarks, you can go back to any location by tapping 
the Bookmarks icon in the Search field (refer to Figure 12-1) to bring up a list 
of bookmarked locations and then tapping a location.

 Chapter 12: Earth, Wind, and Finance
To bookmark a location after searching for it or dropping a pin, tap the 
circled right arrow on the right side of the pin’s label to see the Info screen, 
as shown in Figure 12-7 (left side). You can then mark the spot with a book-
mark that includes a name and description or do other things such as get 
directions. (See the “Getting directions” section in this chapter.)
Tap the Add to Bookmarks button on the Info screen, which brings up the 
onscreen keyboard so that you can type a name for the location, as shown 
in Figure 12-7 (right side). Tap Save in the upper-right corner of the Add 
Bookmark screen to save the bookmark (or Cancel to cancel the bookmark). 
Tap Map in the upper-left corner of the Info screen to go back to the map.

(right).
You can also touch the pin or its label and then tap Directions To Here or 
Directions From Here (refer to Figure 12-7, left side) to get directions. (See 
the later section, “Getting directions.”) 
To go directly to a bookmarked location, tap the Bookmarks icon in the 
Search field (refer to Figure 12-1) and then tap a location, or tap the Done 
button in the upper-right corner to return to the map.
 
The Bookmarks icon in the Search field also offers a list of the recently 
searched locations as well as access to your Contacts list. Tap the 
Bookmarks icon and then tap the Recents button at the bottom of the screen 
to see a list of recent locations found on the map. Tap the Contacts button

next to Recents to view your Contacts and select one to see that person’s 
address on the map. Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner to return 
to the map.
A bird’s-eye view
Do you want to see what the location looks like? You can change the view of 
the location to show a satellite image (if available), a hybrid of street view 
and satellite, or a list of bookmarked locations. Tap the Underneath button — 
the curled page icon in the bottom-right corner (refer to Figure 12-1) — to see 
a menu underneath the map. Then tap Satellite to view a satellite image of the 
site, as shown in Figure 12-8. You can zoom in to the image the same way you 
zoom in to the map.
 
 
Figure 12-8: Choose Satellite view (left) to see a satellite image of the location (center); choose 
 
Hybrid for a satellite-map view (right).
You can also view a hybrid of satellite image and street map — tap the 
Underneath button and then tap Hybrid in the menu underneath the map. 
Getting directions
To get driving directions from one location to another, you first need to 
search for or pinpoint a location, as described in the previous section, and 
then tap Directions at the bottom of the map screen (refer to Figure 12-4, 
right side). 

163
 Chapter 12: Earth, Wind, and Finance
For example, if you want to get directions from your current location to a 
bookmarked location, first find your physical location on the map by tapping 
the compass icon in the bottom-left corner of the map screen (refer to Figure 
12-2). Then tap Directions, and in the Directions screen that appears, your 
current location already occupies the Start field. Tap the Bookmarks icon in 
the End field and select a bookmarked location for the End field. 
You can also tap a pin on a map to see the Info screen for that location, as 
shown in Figure 12-9, and then tap Directions To Here or Directions From 
Here to get directions. The Directions screen appears, with the first location 
selected as either the Start or End. For example, in Figure 12-9, I tapped 
Directions To Here, which automatically placed the location in the End field.
 
 
Figure 12-9: Tap Directions To Here (left) to put the location in the End 
 
field (right).
You can also type entries or select bookmarks for both the Start and End 
fields by tapping those fields and using the onscreen keyboard (refer to 
Figure 12-9, right side).
 
You can switch the entry for Start to End (or vice versa) by tapping the 
looped arrow button to the left of the Start and End fields. Using this button, 
you can get directions one way; then tap the button to reverse the Start and 
End fields to get directions for the way back.
After setting your Start and End locations, tap Route in the bottom-right 
corner of the onscreen keyboard (refer to Figure 12-9, right side) to mark the 
route on the map. Alternatively, you can tap Clear in the upper-left corner 
to reenter your Start and End fields, or Cancel in the upper-right corner to 
cancel getting directions.

164
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
As shown in Figure 12-10, the route on the map in the Overview screen is 
purple, with pins marking the start and end locations. Tap the car icon 
at the top of the Overview screen to see driving directions and the approxi-
mate driving time. If traffic data is available, the driving time is adjusted 
accordingly, but don’t expect miracles — the information depends on 
data collected and services provided by third parties, not by Apple, and 
traffic patterns change. You can also tap the bus icon to see public transit 
directions, or tap the walking man icon to see walking directions. 
 
 
Figure 12-10: Tap Start to see the route (left) step by step from 
 
beginning to end (right).
Digging into Google Earth
Find the source of the Nile River and follow 
it all the way to the great pyramids in Egypt 
(which you can see in the fourth figure). Or just 
take a peek in your neighbor’s backyard or the 
streets where I live (the second figure with blue 
dot). Google Earth, available for free for desk-
top computers, lets you fly anywhere on Earth 
to view satellite imagery, maps, terrain, 3D 
buildings, from galaxies in outer space to the 
canyons and mystery spots of the ocean. 
The Google Earth app for the iPod touch displays 
the same imagery and offers the same naviga-
tional capabilities as the desktop version, and 
it includes layers with geo-located Wikipedia 
articles and Panoramio photos with details 

165
 Chapter 12: Earth, Wind, and Finance
(as shown in the third figure), as well as map 
labels and borders. With the Search Near Me 
function, query results are not only geo-located 
within Google Earth, but also are automatically 
relevant to your location — search for “pizza” 
while in San Francisco, and it shows a collec-
tion of San Francisco pizza restaurants. The 
Auto tilt feature uses the iPod touch built-in 
accelerometer to change your view in Google 
Earth when you tilt the iPod touch — you can 
tilt at an angle to see a skyline view of a loca-
tion or tilt it all the way to see the sky itself. You 
can even track your movements on the planet: 
Tap the Location button to see a blue dot corre-
sponding to your location (see the second figure 
with blue dot), and as your location changes, the 
dot and your view in Google Earth are updated 
accordingly.

166
Part IV: Touching the Online World 
To view directions one step at a time on the map, tap Start in the upper-right 
corner of the Overview screen (refer to Figure 12-10, left side) to see the first 
leg of the journey. Then tap the right-arrow button in the upper-right corner 
of the first leg’s screen to see the next stretch (refer to Figure 12-10, right 
side). You can also tap the left-arrow button in any of the step-by-step direc-
tions to go back a step. The Maps application graciously walks you through 
your entire journey. 
To view all the legs of your journey in a list, tap the Underneath icon in the 
lower-right corner of the display, and tap List. Then tap any location in the 
list to see a map showing that leg of the trip. 
 
To see your most recent set of directions, tap the Bookmarks icon in the 
Search field and tap Recents at the bottom of the Bookmarks screen to 
change it to the Recents screen. If you close Maps and return to it later, your 
directions appear automatically. Tap the Done button in the upper-right 
corner to return to the map.
 
You can also get travel directions in advance (using Google Maps on your 
computer) and then transfer them to your iPod touch by e-mail. You can 
then open the e-mail on your iPod touch and tap the Google Maps embedded 
link — Maps opens automatically to show you the directions. As you open 
more e-mails and tap more links, your directions are remembered in Maps 
on your iPod touch in the Recents screen.
Riding on the Storm
The Weather app provided with your iPod touch looks up the current tem-
perature and weather conditions, and it provides a six-day forecast for any 
city of your choice. (Of course, your iPod touch needs to be connected to 
Wi-Fi and the Internet for the Weather app to work.) Weather isn’t the only 
app that does this — you can try other apps such as The Weather Channel, 
WeatherBug, or AccuWeather (all free).
To use Weather, tap the Weather icon on the Home screen. In daytime, the 
weather screen is light blue, and at night it’s dark purple. What makes Weather 
useful is your ability to add your own cities — as many as you need — so that 
you can look up the weather in multiple locations instantly.
To add a city, follow these steps: 
 
1. Tap the i button in the lower-right corner of the weather display for 
your city, as shown in Figure 12-11 (left side).

167
 Chapter 12: Earth, Wind, and Finance
 
 
Figure 12-11: Tap the i button in Weather (left) to view the list of cities (center) and to add 
 
another city (right).
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the upper-left corner of the Weather screen 
(Figure 12-11, center). 
 
 A location field appears with the onscreen keyboard (Figure 12-11, right 
side). 
 
3. Enter the city’s name or zip code — as you type, suggestions appear 
below in a list. 
 
4. Choose one of the suggestions or continue typing the city name or zip 
code and then tap Search.
 
 The city you chose appears in the list of cities in the Weather screen, 
with a circled minus (–) sign next to it on the left and three horizontal 
gray bars on the right, as shown in Figure 12-12 (left side). 
 
 At this point, you can add more cities by tapping the plus (+) sign in the 
upper-left corner again. You can also reorder the list of cities by drag-
ging the three gray bars next to a city to a new place in the list, as shown 
in Figure 12-12 (right side). 
To delete a city, tap the circled minus sign next to the city name to show the 
Delete button and then tap the Delete button (or tap the circled minus sign 
again to leave it alone).
Tap the Done button in the top-right corner of the Weather screen to finish 
adding cities and see the weather display for your city.

three gray horizontal bars for the city (right).
To switch from one city to the next, flick your finger over the city weather 
display horizontally or tap the tiny white buttons at the bottom of the city 
weather display (refer to Figure 12-11, left side).
Tapping Your Moneymaker
You can check your financial stocks, funds, and indexes with your iPod touch 
as long as it’s connected to Wi-Fi and the Internet. (Whether the news is good 
or bad, you can quickly e-mail your broker — see Chapter 11.)
Tap the Stocks icon on the Home screen. The Stocks app displays a few 
stocks and indexes you may be interested in (such as Apple and Google), 
and it shows updated quotes if the iPod touch is connected to the Internet 
(although quotes may be delayed by up to 20 minutes). Scroll the Stocks list 
by dragging or flicking it with your finger.
Swipe the lower section of the Stocks screen to see a summary, a graph (as 
shown in Figure 12-13, left side), or the latest news. To see a current graph 
of the stock, swipe the lower section to the center and then tap the 1d (one 
day), 1w (one week), 1m (one month), 3m (three months), 6m (six months), 
1y (one year), or 2y (two years) buttons above the graph in the stock reader. 
Tap the change number next to each stock to switch to show the percentage 
change, the market cap, or the change in price. 

169
 Chapter 12: Earth, Wind, and Finance
Of course, you’ll want to add your portfolio to Stocks. To add a stock, index, 
or fund to watch, here’s what you do:
 
1. Tap the i button in the lower-right corner of the stock reader, as 
shown in Figure 12-13 (left side). 
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the upper-left corner of the Stocks screen 
(Figure 12-13, center). 
 
 The Add Stock field appears with the onscreen keyboard (Figure 12-13, 
right side). 
 
3. Enter the stock symbol or company name (or index or fund name).
 
 As you type, suggestions appear below in a list. 
 
4. Choose one of the suggestions or continue typing the symbol or name 
and then touch Search.
 
 The stock, fund, or index you chose appears in the list in the Stocks 
screen, with a circled minus (–) sign next to it on the left, and three 
horizontal gray bars on the right, as shown in Figure 12-14.
 
 At this point, if you want to add more stocks, funds, or indexes, tap the 
plus (+) sign in the upper-left corner again. To reorder a list of stocks, 
drag the three gray bars next to a stock to a new place in the list. 
To delete a stock, tap the circled minus sign next to the stock name to show 
the Delete button and then tap the Delete button (or tap the circled minus 
sign again to leave it alone).
Tap the Done button in the top-right corner of the Stocks screen to finish 
adding stocks and see the stock reader.

Staying in Touch 
and Up-to-Date

B
y now you should be accustomed to using 
your iPod touch like a small computer — 
and that’s just what it is, a computer in your 
pocket that runs apps from the App Store. Some 
of these apps are just as powerful as the ones on 
your computer, especially ones that connect you 
to your social world.
Chapter 13 puts you in contact with your con-
tacts, helps you manage your calendar, and con-
nects you with the most popular social networks 
on the planet — Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. 
I saved the unfunny stuff for Chapter 14: how to 
keep your iPod touch software up-to-date, how 
to reset the software and your settings, and 
how to restore your iPod touch to pristine factory 
condition.

A Day in the Social Life
In This Chapter
▶ Checking your calendar and entering events
▶ Entering and sorting your contacts
▶ Connecting to social networks like Facebook and MySpace
A
s John Lennon once sang, “Life is what happens to you when you’re 
busy making other plans.” And while life happens to you in real time, 
you can consult your iPod touch Calendar app to view your appointments, 
change them, and make new ones. One of the major benefits of using an iPod 
touch is the onscreen keyboard, which you can use to enter text, such as cal-
endar entries, as I describe in this chapter. 
In this chapter, I also demonstrate how to look up contact names, addresses, 
and phone numbers with your iPod touch, change contact 
information, and add new contacts. Any changes you make 
to calendars and contacts are synchronized with your 
desktop applications (as I describe in Chapter 6).
To socialize and stay in contact with friends, relatives, 
and associates, you can use social networks such as 
Facebook and MySpace to share photos, thoughts, 
links, and profile information. The App Store offers 
social networking apps that link you directly to these 
networks, and to messaging sites such as Twitter. 
You’ll find all this and more in this chapter on your 
social life with iPod touch.
Checking Your Calendar
The Calendar app isn’t just for looking up dates (though it’s quite good at 
that). If you see a blank calendar, it means you need to synchronize your 
iPod touch with your calendar files from iCal (Mac) or Outlook (Windows), as 
I describe in Chapter 6. 

174
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
Tap the Calendar icon on the Home screen. Here’s what happens:
 
✓ If this is your first visit to the Calendar app and you’ve synchronized 
multiple calendars to your iPod touch, a list of your calendars appears 
(see Figure 13-1, left side). Tap All at the top to view all calendars 
merged into one or tap a specific calendar to see only that calendar. The 
calendar appears in a monthly view by default (see Figure 13-1, right side). 
 
✓ If you opened Calendar before, the app shows the calendar and view 
opened previously.
Tap any day to see the events on that day, which are displayed below the 
 calendar view in a list.
 
 
Figure 13-1: The Calendar app’s list of calendars (left) and monthly 
 
view (right).
Tap the List, Day, or Month buttons to change the calendar view to a list of 
events, a full day of scheduled appointments, or a month view, respectively. 
If you roam around from day to day or month to month, tap the Today button 
in the lower-left corner of the display to see the calendar for today.
A change is gonna come
Change happens, and you’ll want to change your schedule or even add new 
events as you learn about them. Although you can enter appointments and 
events on your computer and sync them with your iPod touch, as I show 

175
 Chapter 13: A Day in the Social Life
you in Chapter 6, you can also enter and change appointments and events 
directly in your iPod touch and keep changes and additions synced with your 
computer.
To add an event, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Calendar app as described earlier.
 
 The Calendar app opens (refer to Figure 13-1) — either the Calendar view 
appears, or if you have multiple calendars, the list of calendars appears — 
in which case you need to tap a calendar to use for the new event. 
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the upper-right corner of the Calendar screen.
 
 The Add Event screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-2 (left side).
 
3. Tap the Title Location button and enter the event’s title and location 
using the onscreen keyboard.
 
 The Title and Location fields appear along with the onscreen keyboard, 
as shown in Figure 13-2 (right side).

9. (Optional) Set the event to repeat by tapping Repeat and selecting a 
repeat time; then tap Save (or Cancel).
 
 You can set the event to repeat every day, every week, every two weeks, 
every month, or every year (or none, to not repeat). After you tap Save or 
Cancel, the Add Event screen appears again for selecting more options.
 
10. (Optional) Set an alert for a time before the event by tapping Alert 
and choosing an alert time; then tap Save (or Cancel).
 
 You can set the alert to occur from five minutes to two days before the 
event. You can also set a second alert time in case you miss the first 
one. After you tap Save or Cancel, the Add Event screen appears again 
for selecting more options.
 
11. (Optional) If you have multiple calendars synced with your iPod 
touch, you can change the calendar for the event by tapping Calendar 
and choosing a calendar.
 
 The Calendars screen appears with a list of your calendars. Tap a cal-
endar’s name to choose it. After you tap Save or Cancel, the Add Event 
screen appears again for changing event options.
 
12. (Optional) Enter notes about the event by tapping Notes and using the 
onscreen keyboard to type notes.
 
 The Notes field appears along with the keyboard so that you can type 
your notes. After you tap Save or Cancel, the Add Event screen appears 
again for changing event options.
 
13. Tap Done in the upper-right corner of the Add Event screen to save 
the event (or Cancel in the upper-left corner to cancel the event).
 
 The new event now appears in your calendar in the lower portion of the 
Calendar screen when you select the day, as shown in Figure 13-4 (left 
side).
To edit an event, tap the event in the lower portion of the Calendar screen, and 
then tap Edit in the upper-right corner of the Event screen. The event informa-
tion appears and is ready for editing or deleting, as shown in Figure 13-4 (right 
side). To edit the event information, follow Steps 3–13 in this section.
The Delete Event button appears only when you’re editing an event. After 
tapping Delete Event, a warning appears to confirm the deletion — tap Delete 
Event again or tap Cancel. The Calendar screen appears.

Yesterday’s settings (and today’s)
You can set alerts for meeting invitations and choose how many weeks of 
events to sync back to (to clear out old events). Choose Settings➪Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen and then scroll the Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars settings screen to the Calendars section, as shown in Figure 13-5 
(left side).
To set the option for how far back in time to sync your calendar events, tap 
Sync and choose a period of time (such as Events 2 Weeks Back).
If you have a Microsoft Exchange account set up with Calendars enabled, you 
can receive and respond to meeting invitations from others in your organiza-
tion that also use Exchange. To set a sound as an alert for receiving a meeting 
invitation, tap the Off button for New Invitation Alerts to turn it on.
You can also turn time zone support on or off. When time zone support 
is on, event dates and times are displayed in the time zone of the city you 
selected. When time zone support is off, events are displayed in the time 
zone of your current location as determined by the network time. You might 
want to turn it on and select your home city so that dates and times are dis-
played as if you were in your home city, rather than where you actually are. 
For example, if you live in San Francisco and you’re visiting New York, turn-
ing on Time Zone Support and selecting San Francisco keeps the dates and 
times in your calendars on San Francisco time. Otherwise, they would switch 
to New York time.

typed. Select the city to return to the Time Zone Support screen and then tap 
the Mail button in the upper-left corner to return to the settings screen — or, 
if you’re finished making changes, press the Home button to leave settings 
altogether and return to the Home screen.
 
You can set your iPod touch to play a beeping sound for your calendar alert. 
Choose Settings➪General➪Sounds and tap the Off button for Calendar Alerts 
to turn it on. (Tap it again to turn it off.)
Using Your Contacts
The bits of information that you’re most likely to need on the road are peo-
ple’s names, addresses, and phone numbers. You can use the Contacts app 
on your iPod touch to store this information and keep it all in sync with your 
computer. (For sync info, see Chapter 6.)
To view contacts on an iPod touch, tap the Contacts icon on the Home 
screen. The All Contacts screen appears. If you’ve organized contacts into 
groups, you can tap the Groups button in the upper-left corner of the screen 

180
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
to show the Groups screen, and 
then tap a group to see just that 
group, or tap All Contacts to return 
to the All Contacts screen. 
The contact list is sorted automati-
cally in alphabetical order by last 
name (in bold) but displayed so that 
the first name comes first, as shown 
in Figure 13-6. Scroll the list of con-
tacts with your finger or tap a letter 
of the alphabet along the right side 
to go directly to names that begin 
with that letter. Then tap a contact 
to see that person’s info screen. 
The contact’s info screen shows all 
the information about reaching that 
contact. Tap an e-mail address to 
bring up the Mail app and send an 
e-mail to that contact. Tap a Web 
site address to load that page into 
Safari. Tap a physical address (with 
a street address) to bring up the 
Maps app and locate the contact on 
the map.
Orders to sort and display
You can change which way the contacts sort so that you can look up people 
by their first names (which can be time-consuming with so many friends 
named Elvis). Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then scroll the 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen to the Contacts section (refer to 
Figure 13-5, left side). Tap Sort Order and then tap one of these options:
 
✓ First, Last: Sorts the contact list by first name, followed by the last 
name, so that Brian Jones sorts under the letter B for Brian (after Brian 
Auger but before Brian Wilson). 
 
✓ Last, First: Sorts the contacts by last name, followed by the first name, 
so that Brian Jones sorts under the letter J for Jones. (Jones, Brian 
appears after Jones, Alice but before Jones, Norah.)
You can also display contacts with their first names followed by their last 
names, or last names followed by first names, regardless of how you sort 
Figure 13-6: Scroll the alphabetical list or tap a 
letter along the right side.

Contacts, Calendars settings screen to the Contacts section. Tap Display 
Order and then tap one of these options:
 
✓ First Last: Displays the contacts list by first name and then last name, as 
in Paul McCartney.
 
✓ Last, First: Displays the contacts list by last name followed by a comma 
and the first name, as in McCartney, Paul.
Soul searchin’
Can’t remember the person’s full 
name or last name? You can search 
for any part of a person’s name in 
Contacts by tapping the Search 
entry field at the very top of the list 
of contacts. The Search entry field 
appears with the onscreen keyboard, 
as shown in Figure 13-7, and sugges-
tions appear as you type.
Tap a suggested name to open the 
Contacts record for that person. You 
can then edit or delete the contact 
information.
Adding, editing, and 
deleting contacts
You meet people all the time, so why 
not enter their information immedi-
ately? You can enter new contacts, 
edit existing contacts, and even 
delete contacts directly on your iPod 
touch, and keep your contacts in 
sync with your computer. (For sync 
info, see Chapter 6.)

Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
Instant voice and text messaging
The iPhone gets all the glory for its commu-
nicating abilities with its phone and SMS text 
messaging services provided by the service 
carrier (AT&T in the U.S.), but the iPod touch is 
no slouch in this department — in fact, the iPod 
touch can make you carrier-free. All you need is 
a Wi-Fi connection that accesses the Internet.
Skype is a service that lets you make phone calls 
over the Internet. Calls to other Skype users are 
free, but calls to other landlines and mobile 
phones require some money on your part. The 
Skype for iPhone app (free) works on the iPod 
touch to give you phone service and instant text 
messages to anyone else on Skype. All you need 
is a Wi-Fi connection and a microphone for your 
iPod touch (for voice calls). You can use the 
Apple In-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic 
(available in the Apple Store) or products from 
other companies, such as V-MODA Vibe II with 
Microphone Headphone/Headset for iPhone/
iPod, or TouchMic Handsfree Lapel Microphone 
and Adapter, which adds a microphone and 
volume control to any regular headset. 
If all you need is instant messaging, try the AOL 
Instant Messenger (AIM) app, which is popu-
lar in the U.S. You can send and receive instant 
messages on your iPod touch, view your buddy 
list, and rearrange the entries in groups or sepa-
rate them as favorites. If you’re using a lot of dif-
ferent chat clients, the IM+ app may be a better 
choice — it supports AIM, Yahoo! Messenger, 
MSN, Google Talk, Jabber, ICQ and MySpace. 
Palringo is another excellent multifunctional 
instant messaging app that supports MSN, 
Yahoo! Messenger, AIM, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ, 
Jabber, Google Talk, and iChat.
If you’re looking for an iPod touch app that lets 
you chat with Yahoo! Messenger folks and also 
connects with various other social networks, 
check out the oneConnect! app, which lets you 
keep an eye on your Facebook, Flickr, Last.fm, 
Twitter, Bebo, Dopplr, MySpace and YouTube 
accounts. There are even a few social networks 
set up specifically for iPhone and iPod touch 
users — for example, WhosHere (see figure) 
is a social proximity application that connects 
you with people who are nearby or anywhere 
in the world. You can send unlimited, free 
text and image messages to other WhosHere 
 participants.
To edit a contact, tap the contact to see the contact’s Info screen, then tap 
Edit in the upper-right corner of the Info screen to show the circled minus (–) 
sign and plus (+) sign buttons. 
You can edit or delete any information for a contact while leaving the rest of 
the information intact. Tap any field to edit the information in that field. Tap 
the circled minus (–) sign next to the information to reveal a Delete button; 

185
 Chapter 13: A Day in the Social Life
tap the Delete button to delete the information, or tap the circled minus sign 
again to leave it alone. 
To change a photo, tap the existing photo in the upper-left corner of the 
Info screen. A pop-up menu appears for you to tap Choose Photo, Edit 
Photo, Delete Photo, or Cancel. Tap Choose Photo to choose a new photo as 
described in Step 13 earlier. To move or scale the photo, Tap Edit Photo to 
show the Move and Scale screen. Then pinch the image with your fingers to 
zoom out or unpinch to zoom in, and drag the image with your finger to show 
only a portion of it. Tap the Set Photo button in the bottom-right corner of 
the Move and Scale screen to save the edited image (or touch Cancel). You 
return again to the Info screen.
Tap Done in the upper-right corner of the Info screen to finish editing and 
return to the contact information.
To delete a contact entirely, tap Edit, scroll down to the bottom and then tap 
Delete Contact. Remember, if you do this, the contact will also be deleted 
from your contact list on your computer when you sync your iPod touch.
Recording Voice Memos
The Voice Memos app lets you record audio through an external microphone 
(such as the Apple In-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic). You can then 
send recordings to others by e-mail, or sync them back to your computer’s 
iTunes library. After syncing with iTunes (as I describe in Chapter 5), the 
recordings appear in the music portion of your iTunes library in the Voice 
Memos playlist (created for you if you don’t already have one).
To start recording, tap the Voice Memos app on the Home screen and then 
tap the red dot button on the left side of the VU meter on the microphone 
recording screen. (You can also press the center button on the control 
capsule of the Apple In-Ear Headphones to start recording.) The red dot 
changes to a Pause button, as shown in Figure 13-10 (left side), and the list 
button on the right side of the VU meter changes to a Stop button. Tap the 
Pause or Stop button to stop recording.
Tap the list button on the right side of the VU meter to see the Voice Memos 
screen with your list of recordings, as shown in Figure 13-10 (center). Select 
a recording, and you can then tap Share to send it by e-mail, or tap Delete 
to delete it. After tapping Share, tap Email Voice Memo to open a new e-mail 
with the recording (or tap Cancel). See Chapter 11 for details on sending 
an e-mail.
You can also tap the Play button on the left of the recording to play it, and 
tap the right arrow on the far right side of the recording to open the Info 
screen for that recording, as shown in Figure 13-10 (right side).

Figure 13-10: Record your voice (left), select a saved recording (center), and open the Info 
 
screen (right).
How can you specify what the 
recording is about, besides its date 
and time? You can assign a label to 
the recording by tapping the record-
ing’s information in the Info screen. 
A list of labels appears, including 
Interview, Lecture, and Memo, as 
well as Custom for setting your own 
label. Tap a label to assign the label 
and then tap Info in the top-left 
corner to return to the Info screen. 
The Info screen also lets you trim the 
recording to be shorter — tap Trim 
Memo to view the playback time-
line, as shown in Figure 13-11, and 
tap along the timeline to set a stop 
time. Then tap Trim Voice Memo (or 
Cancel to cancel). 
Tap Voice Memos in the top-left 
corner of the Info screen to return 
to the Voice Memos screen, and 
tap Done in the top-right corner to 
return to the microphone recording 
screen.

 Chapter 13: A Day in the Social Life
Socializing on Networks
Connecting socially over a digital network isn’t new — I connected to friends 
way back in the pre-Internet dark ages by using exotic-sounding networks 
such as Usenet, bulletin board systems (BBS), The Source, CompuServe, the 
WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link), and EIES (Murray Turoff’s server-based 
Electronic Information Exchange Service). What’s new is that more sophisti-
cated social networks have appeared and gone mainstream very quickly, with 
MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter leading the pack.
You can use your iPod touch to stay in touch with your connections on these 
and many other social networks — viewing and typing messages, chatting, 
uploading and sharing photos, joining groups, and so on. All you need is a 
Wi-Fi connection so you can hop onto the Internet.
You’ve got a Facebook friend
Facebook is the fastest-growing free-access social networking site as of this 
writing, with more than 200 million active users worldwide. If you’re one of 
them (as I am), you already know that you can add friends, send them mes-
sages, and update your personal profile with photos, videos, links, and all 
sorts of Facebook widgets that extend the service’s functions. Although you 
can do all this using a browser on your computer and using Safari on your 
iPod touch, the site itself is far too cumbersome for easy access on your iPod 
touch. What’s needed is a “baby Facebook” on the iPod touch.
And that’s exactly what Facebook for iPhone is: This app — which also runs on 
the iPod touch — lets you check your friends’ status updates and photos, start 
a conversation in Facebook Chat, and upload images from your iPod touch.
 
 After downloading the Facebook app (see Chapter 4 for details on download-
ing apps), tap the Facebook icon on the Home screen and then log in to your 
Facebook account, as shown in Figure 13-12 (left side). Your Facebook home 
screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-12 (right side), showing your news feed 
(top stories, status updates, and photos). If you have any notifications, a 
number appears on top of the Notifications tab (see Figure 13-12, right side). 
After logging in, the Facebook app remembers your username and password 
so that you don’t have to type them to log in again. (Of course, that means if 
anyone grabs your iPod touch they’ll have access to your Facebook account — 
use a passcode to lock up your iPod touch, as I describe in Chapter 3, so that 
no one can use it without the passcode.) If you don’t want the Facebook app 
to remember your login info, tap the profile icon to see your profile screen and 
then tap the Logout button in the upper-left corner of the profile screen.
Along the bottom of the Facebook screen are the Home icon for returning to 
the Home screen, the profile icon (with your first name) for showing your 
profile, the Friends icon to access a list of your Facebook friends, and the 
Inbox icon to check your messages. You can also tap Chat to chat directly 
with any of your friends who are online. 

188
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
 
 
Figure 13-12: Log in to your Facebook account (left) to see your home 
 
news feed (right).
The Facebook app even lets you upload and share photos: Tap the profile 
icon to see your profile and then tap Add a Photo. You can then pick a photo 
from your iPod touch photo albums, tag the photo with a person’s name, 
and type a caption. Tap Upload to upload the photo, which is placed in the 
Mobile Uploads section of your profile photos.
MySpace odyssey
So you want to be a MySpace cowboy or cowgirl? MySpace, owned by Fox 
Interactive Media, was the most popular mainstream social networking site 
until Facebook came along. Today, it’s the number-two service, and it’s still 
an awesomely huge network. MySpace focuses on music, movies, and TV 
shows — just about every band in the universe has a MySpace page, and it’s 
easy to add music to your profile.
You can use Safari on your iPod touch to access MySpace, but like most social 
networks, the home page you see is far too cumbersome for easy access on 
your iPod touch. The MySpace Mobile for iPhone app is much easier to use and 
works fine on your iPod touch as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection. It lets 
you send and receive messages, check status updates and photos, stay 
up-to-date on bulletins, and upload images from your iPod touch.
 
 After downloading the MySpace app (see Chapter 4 for app downloading 
details), tap the MySpace icon on the Home screen and log in to your MySpace 
account, as shown in Figure 13-13 (left side). As you log in, you can turn on the 
Remember Me option so that after logging in, the MySpace app remembers 
your username and password so that you don’t have to log in again.

189
 Chapter 13: A Day in the Social Life
After you log in, your MySpace Home screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-13 
(right side), with menu selections for viewing and editing your profile, check-
ing the status and mood messages from your friends, checking friend updates, 
adding comments, reading bulletins, reading blogs, and changing your settings.
Along the bottom of the MySpace screen are the Home icon for returning to 
the Home screen, the Mail icon to check your messages, the Requests icon 
to view and respond to requests, the Friends icon for a list of your MySpace 
friends, and the Photos icon to upload photos to your MySpace page. To add 
photos, tap the Photos icon to see the photos already on your MySpace page 
and then tap the Add Photos button. You can then pick a photo from your 
iPod touch photo albums.
 
 
Figure 13-13: Log in to your MySpace account (left) to see your Home 
 
screen (right).
Dedicated follower of Twitter
The most talked-about newcomer to the social network scene is Twitter, a 
free social messaging utility for staying connected with people in real time. 
With Twitter, you can post and receive messages that are 140 characters 
or less — called tweets. All public tweets are available to read on the public 
timeline, or you can read just the ones posted by the Twitter members you 
follow. You can post a tweet that can be read by all of your followers and by 
anyone reading the public tweets.
Members use Twitter to organize impromptu gatherings, carry on a 
group conversation, or just send a quick update to let people know what’s 
going on. Companies use Twitter to announce products and carry on 

190
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
conversations with their customers. You can use Safari on your iPod touch 
to access Twitter, but there are alternatives that offer a better Twitter 
experience on your iPod touch.
 
 For example, you can use the Twitter for iPhone Web service (http://
twitterforiphone.com) with your iPod touch to easily flip through all of 
your messages with the flick of a finger. Twitter for iPhone offers a menu, as 
shown in Figure 13-14 (left side), for checking recent posts, updating your 
status, sending direct messages and replies to others on Twitter, browsing 
friends, and adding new friends (called followers). 
There are several iPod touch–compatible apps in the App Store for access-
ing Twitter, but my favorite as of this writing is Twitterific — the free version 
includes advertising (see Figure 13-14, right side), but a premium version is 
also available without ads. The free version of Twitterific does all the basic 
stuff you’d expect a Twitter client to do: You can read messages from people 
you follow, post messages of your own, and get alerted to private direct mes-
sages and public replies. 
And wherever you go, “tweetness follows.” Twitterific taps into the iPod 
touch’s built-in location services so that, with your permission, it can let 
your followers know where you are and let you know when your followers 
are posting from a nearby location. You can set options for viewing mes-
sages, optimize the interface for left-handed operation, and use its own mini-
browser to view linked Web pages without having to quit the app and run 
Safari. You can also copy a link to the last-opened Web page in Safari on your 
iPod touch into a tweet — a very useful trick if you like to include Web links 
with your tweets. Tweet dreams!

Resetting, Updating, and Restoring
In This Chapter
▶ Resetting your iPod touch system
▶ Updating iPod touch software with the newest version
▶ Restoring your iPod touch settings
▶ Restoring an iPod touch to its factory condition
T
his no-nonsense chapter may not be fun, but it’s necessary. Humans 
aren’t perfect, and neither are the machines they make. If your iPod 
touch stops working as it should, or an app causes it to freeze up, you can 
turn to this chapter. You also find out how to reset your network settings and 
the keyboard dictionary.
This chapter also covers updating the firmware and software 
on your iPod touch. (Firmware is software encoded in hard-
ware.) All software devices need to be updated now and 
then — it’s a good thing, because new versions fix 
known bugs and add improvements. 
Finally, I describe how to restore your iPod touch 
to its factory default condition. Restoring to fac-
tory condition is a drastic measure that erases any 
music or information on the iPod touch, but it usu-
ally solves a software glitch when nothing else does.
Powering Down and Resetting
Sometimes problems arise with electronics and software 
that can prevent an iPod touch from returning from an app or 
from turning on properly with all its content and playlists. If your iPod 
touch freezes while running an app, press and hold the Home button below 
the screen for at least six seconds, until the app quits. If the iPod touch still 

192
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
doesn’t respond, turn it off by pressing the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button on 
the top and then press the same button again to turn it back on.
If that doesn’t work, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the top for a 
few seconds until a red slider that says Slide to power off appears on 
the screen. Slide the slider with your finger to turn off the iPod touch. Then 
press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple logo appears. The iPod 
touch starts up again.
Resetting your iPod touch system
You probably won’t be too surprised to discover that, on the off chance your 
iPod touch gets confused or refuses to turn on, you can fix it by resetting it 
and restarting the system — just like computers and other iPods. Resetting 
does not restore the iPod touch to its original factory condition, nor does it 
erase anything — your content and settings remain intact.
To reset the iPod touch, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home 
button at the same time for at least ten seconds, until the Apple logo appears.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music 
and data files.
Resetting your settings
You can reset all or part of your iPod touch settings while leaving your con-
tent and personal information intact. To see your resetting options, choose 
Settings➪General➪Reset from the Home screen. The Reset screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 14-1.
You have several options for resetting: 
 
✓ Reset All Settings: To return your iPod touch to its original condition 
with no preferences or settings while still keeping your content or 
your personal information (including contacts, calendars, and e-mail 
accounts) intact, tap Reset All Settings.
 
✓ Erase All Content and Settings: To erase everything, first connect the 
iPod touch to your computer or a power adapter and then tap Erase 
All Content and Settings. This operation can take hours! It wipes out 
everything by overwriting the data stored on the iPod touch. You can’t 
use the iPod touch until it finishes. It may be easier and faster to do a 
full restore from iTunes, as I describe later in this chapter, in the section 
“Restoring your iPod touch.”

193
 Chapter 14: Resetting, Updating, and Restoring
 
✓ Reset Network Settings: You 
can reset your network settings 
so that your previously used 
networks are removed from the 
Wi-Fi list. This type of reset is 
useful if you can’t find any other 
way to stop a Wi-Fi network 
from connecting automatically 
to your iPod touch — just tap 
Reset Network Settings, and 
you’re automatically discon-
nected from any Wi-Fi network. 
(Wi-Fi is turned off and then 
back on.) For more details about 
choosing Wi-Fi networks, see 
Chapter 4. 
 
✓ Reset Keyboard Dictionary: To 
reset the keyboard dictionary, 
tap Reset Keyboard Dictionary. 
This erases all words that have 
been added to the dictionary. 
(Words are added when you 
reject words suggested by the 
onscreen keyboard and type 
the word — see Chapter 2 for 
details.)
 
✓ Reset Home Screen Layout: If you rearranged the icons on your Home 
screen (as I describe in Chapter 2), you may want to set them back 
to their original positions. To reset your Home screen to the default 
arrangement, tap Reset Home Screen Layout.
 
✓ Reset Location Warnings: Location warnings are requests by apps to 
use the Location Services. The iPod touch stops displaying these warn-
ings the second time you tap OK. If you want the iPod touch to start 
 displaying the warnings again, tap Reset Location Warnings. 
Updating Your iPod touch
You should always keep your iPod touch updated with new versions of the 
software that controls the device. iTunes automatically checks for updates 
of this software and lets you update your iPod touch without affecting the 
music or data stored on it. 
Figure 14-1: Options for resetting your iPod 
touch settings and clearing all content.

194
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
Make sure that you use the newest version of iTunes. To check for the avail-
ability of an updated version for Windows, choose Help➪Check for iTunes 
Updates.
If you use a Mac and you enabled the Software Update option in your System 
Preferences, Apple automatically informs you of updates to your Apple soft-
ware for the Mac, including iTunes, Safari, iCal, and Address Book. All you 
need to do is select which updates to download and then click the Install 
button to download them. iTunes includes updates for all generations of 
iPods and can detect which iPod model you have.
Checking the software version
To determine which version of iPod software is installed on your iPod touch, 
choose Settings➪General➪About. Next to the word Version is information 
that describes the software version installed.
 
You can also determine the software version on your iPod touch by using 
iTunes. Connect the iPod touch to your computer and select it in the iTunes 
Source pane (in the Devices section). The iPod touch summary page appears 
to the right of the Source pane, and the software version appears next to the 
Software Version heading at the top of the page.
Updating with newer software
iTunes tells you whether your iPod touch has the newest software installed. 
Connect the iPod touch to your computer and select it in the iTunes Source 
pane (in the Devices section). The iPod touch Summary page appears to the 
right of the Source pane, as shown in Figure 14-2, and the Version section of 
the page tells you whether your iPod touch software is up-to-date and when 
iTunes will check for new software. 
If an update is available, a dialog appears to ask permission to download it. 
Go ahead and click OK to update the iPod touch software; you’ll be happy 
you did. After updating the software, iTunes continues syncing with the iPod 
touch until it is finished.
 
You can also check for new software at any time by clicking the Check for 
Update button on the Summary page.

Figure 14-2: Use iTunes to update or restore your iPod touch.
Restoring Your iPod touch
You can restore your iPod touch to its original factory condition. This opera-
tion erases its storage and returns the iPod touch to its original settings. If you 
intend to change the computer you’re using for syncing your iPod touch, you 
have to restore the device, especially if you’re switching from a Mac to a PC as 
your sync computer.
To replace content that was erased by the restore operation, sync your iPod 
touch from your computer’s iTunes library, as I describe in Chapter 5.
Restoring previous settings
iTunes provides protection and backs up your iPod touch settings so that 
you can restore them. This backup comes in handy if you want to apply the 
settings to a new iPod touch or to an iPod touch that you had to restore to its 
factory conditions.

196
Part V: Staying in Touch and Up-to-Date 
Whenever you synchronize your iPod touch, iTunes automatically copies all 
the settings you use to customize your iPod touch and its apps, including 
Wi-Fi network settings, the keyboard dictionary, and settings for contacts, 
calendars, and e-mail accounts. 
To restore your settings, connect your new or restored iPod touch to the 
same computer and copy of iTunes you used before, so that iTunes remem-
bers the backup settings. iTunes should open automatically. (If it doesn’t, 
open iTunes manually.) Then follow the step-by-step instructions in Chapter 1 
for connecting your iPod touch to iTunes and setting it up. As you continue 
through the setup screens, iTunes provides the option to restore the settings 
from a previously backed-up iPod touch or to set up the iPod touch as new. 
Choose the option to restore the settings and then click Continue to finish 
setting up your iPod touch.
To delete the backed-up settings for your iPod touch, open iTunes and choose 
iTunes➪Preferences (on a Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (on a Windows PC). 
Click the Devices tab, select the iPod touch in the Device Backups list, and 
then click Remove Backup. You don’t need to connect your iPod touch to 
do this.
Restoring to factory conditions
Restoring an iPod touch erases its storage and sets all settings to their origi-
nal default values. It’s the last resort for fixing problems, and it’s the only 
choice if you want to switch computers for syncing.
To restore an iPod touch, follow these steps for both the Mac and Windows 
versions of iTunes:
 
1. Connect the iPod touch to your computer.
 
 iTunes opens automatically.
 
2. Select the iPod touch in the Devices section of the Source pane and 
click the Summary tab if it isn’t already selected.
 
 The iPod touch Summary pane appears to the right of the Source pane.
 
3. Click the Restore button.
 
 An alert dialog appears to confirm that you want to restore the iPod 
touch.
 
4. Click the Restore button again to confirm the restore operation.
 
 A progress bar appears, indicating the progress of the restore operation. 
iTunes notifies you when the restore is finished.

197
 Chapter 14: Resetting, Updating, and Restoring
 
5. Sync your iPod touch with content from your iTunes library.
 
 Sync your iPod touch with the content in your library or manually 
manage your content, as I describe in Chapter 5. 
 
6. Sync your iPod touch with personal information (contacts, calendars, 
notes, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks).
 
 Sync your iPod touch with your personal info, as I describe in Chapter 6. 
 
7. When you finish syncing, eject the iPod touch by clicking the Eject 
button next to its name in the Source pane.
Now, with iPod touch restored, refreshed, and re-synced, you’re ready to rock!

Part VI
The Part of Tens

You’ve reached the last part, the part you’ve 
come to expect in every For Dummies book: 
This is the part that neatly encapsulates just 
about all the interesting aspects of this book’s 
topic. Like the compilers of other important 
lists — David Letterman’s Top Ten, the FBI’s 
Ten Most Wanted, the Seven Steps to Heaven, the 
12 Gates to the City, the 12 Steps to Recovery, The 
13 Question Method, and the Billboard Hot 100 — 
I’m serious about the ritual of putting together the 
For Dummies Part of Tens.
And so, I offer in Chapter 15 ten tips not found 
elsewhere in the book, including keeping your 
 battery juiced and your screen clean; rating your 
songs, deleting apps, videos, and podcasts from 
your iPod touch; and using international key-
boards for different languages, including 
handwritten Chinese.
In Chapter 16, the last chapter of this book, I’ve 
compiled ten great apps for the iPod touch that 
shook the iPod world and changed it forever. 
These consist of the apps not mentioned else-
where in this book that you can obtain from the 
App Store — many of them free.

Ten Tangible Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping your battery juiced and your screen clean
▶ Rating your songs
▶ Deleting apps, videos, and podcasts from your iPod touch
▶ Using international keyboards for different languages
T
his book is filled with tips, but I’ve put in this chapter ten truly handy 
ones that didn’t fit in elsewhere but which can help make your iPod 
touch experience a completely satisfying one.
Saving the Life of Your Battery
Follow these simple rules: 
 
✓ Don’t keep an iPod touch in a snug carrying 
case when charging — that snug case can cause 
overheating.
 
✓ Top it off with power whenever it’s convenient. 
 
✓ Set your iPod touch to automatically go 
to sleep by choosing Settings➪General➪
Auto-Lock from the Home screen. 
Everything else you need to know is in Chapter 1.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Keeping Your Screen Clean
If the iPod touch display has excessive moisture on it from humidity or wet 
fingers, wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If it’s dirty, use a soft, slightly damp, 
lint-free cloth — an inexpensive eyeglass cleaning cloth sold in vision care 
stores or pharmacies is a good choice. By no means should you use window 
cleaners, household cleaners, aerosol sprays, solvents, alcohol, ammonia, or 
abrasives — they can scratch or otherwise damage the display. Also, try not 
to get any moisture in any of the openings, as it could short out the device. 
Getting Healthy with Nike
Use your iPod touch as a workout companion with Nike+ running shoes and 
a Nike+ iPod Sport Kit. Its sensor fits inside your Nike+ shoe under the insole. 
The current-generation iPod touch includes a receiver, but the first-generation 
iPod touch requires a separate receiver. 
When you have the kit and the shoes, activate the app on your iPod touch — 
choose Settings➪Nike + iPod and tap Off for the Nike + iPod option to turn 
it on. You can track your pace, time, and distance from one workout to the 
next, and you can pick songs and playlists to match. You can even sync your 
workout data with nikeplus.com, see all your runs, and share motivation with 
runners across the world. 
Rating Your Songs
Ratings are useful — the Shuffle and Genius features are influenced by rat-
ings, and you can define smart playlists with ratings to select only rated 
songs so you can avoid the clunkers and spinal tappers. In fact, when you 
try to put a music library on your iPod touch that’s larger than the device’s 
capacity, iTunes decides which songs to synchronize based on — you 
guessed it, ratings.
iTunes lets you rate your songs, but so does your iPod touch. You can rate 
any song on your iPod touch as you listen to it. Ratings you assign on your 
iPod touch are automatically resynchronized back to your iTunes library 
when you connect your iPod touch again. 

203
 Chapter 15: Ten Tangible Tips
To assign a rating to a song on your iPod touch, follow these steps:
 
1. Start playing a song (see Chapter 7 for details).
 
 The Now Playing screen appears.
 
2. Tap the List button to display a list of the album or playlist contents.
 
 The List button is in the upper-right corner.
 
3. Tap the title of any song in the track listing or leave selected the song 
that’s playing.
 
4. Drag across the ratings bar at the top of the track listing to give the 
song zero to five stars.
 
 The upper limit is five stars (for the best).
Deleting Apps from Your iPod touch
You can turn off the synchronization of certain apps in your iTunes library 
before syncing your iPod touch to iTunes, as I describe in Chapter 5, so 
that the apps disappear from your iPod touch. But you can also delete apps 
directly from your iPod touch.
Touch and hold any icon on the Home screen until all the icons begin to 
wiggle (as if you’re about to rearrange them or add Home screens). To delete 
an app, tap the circled X that appears inside the app’s icon as it wiggles. Your 
iPod touch displays a warning that deleting the app also deletes all its data; 
tap Delete to go ahead and delete the app and its data or tap Cancel to cancel.
To stop the icons from wiggling, press the Home button on the device, which 
saves any changes you made to your Home screens.
Deleting Videos and Podcasts 
from Your iPod touch
Need more room on your iPod touch? You can delete a video or podcast epi-
sode directly from your iPod touch by flicking left or right across the video or 
podcast episode selection and then tapping the Delete button that appears, 
as shown in Figure 15-1. 

204
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Your video or podcast episode is 
deleted from your iPod touch only. 
When you sync your iPod touch with 
iTunes, the video or podcast episode 
is copied back to your iPod touch. 
If you want to prevent the video or 
podcast episode from appearing on 
your iPod touch after syncing, dese-
lect it first before syncing your iPod 
touch, or switch to manually manag-
ing music and videos, as I describe 
in Chapter 5. Note: If you delete a 
rented movie from an iPod touch, 
it’s gone forever (or until you rent it 
again).
Measuring Traffic in Maps
The Maps app not only shows you 
the route to take, but in some areas 
it can also show you traffic patterns 
so you can avoid the jams. The traf-
fic data is constantly updated and 
aggregated from a variety of Internet 
sources by Google. It is available 
for more than 30 major U.S. cities, 
including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington.
To use Maps, tap the Maps icon on the Home screen. The Maps app 
appears (refer to Chapter 12). You can obtain directions first, as I describe 
in Chapter 12, or just display any location on the map that has highways. To 
show traffic information, tap the Underneath button (the curled page icon 
in the bottom-right corner) to see a menu underneath the map and then tap 
Show Traffic. 
When the map shows traffic, highways are color-coded according to the flow 
of traffic: 
 
✓ Green for highways moving faster than 50 miles per hour (mph)
 
✓ Yellow for 25–50 mph
 
✓ Red for less than 25 mph
Figure 15-1: Flick left or right across the video 
or podcast episode to see the Delete button.

205
 Chapter 15: Ten Tangible Tips
If you don’t see color-coded highways, you may need to zoom out to see high-
ways and major roads.
To stop showing the traffic, tap the Underneath button and then tap Hide 
Traffic.
Turning On International Keyboards
You can turn on keyboards for differ-
ent languages and use them simul-
taneously. To turn on international 
keyboards, choose Settings➪
General➪Keyboard from the Home 
screen and then tap International 
Keyboards (scroll the list to find it). 
The international keyboards appear, 
as shown in Figure 15-2.
You can turn on any of the key-
boards you need — tap Off to turn 
each one on. To access languages 
with more than one keyboard, such 
as Japanese, tap Japanese first and 
then tap the specific keyboard layout 
(QWERTY or Kana).
You can then switch keyboards 
while typing information by tap-
ping the globe icon, as shown in 
Figure 15-3, that appears to the right 
of the .?123 key when more than one 
international keyboard is turned on. 
The language of the newly active 
 keyboard appears briefly in the 
spacebar.
Each time you tap the globe icon, the keyboard layout switches to the next 
language you’ve turned on, in the order that they appear in the international 
keyboards list. 
Figure 15-2: Turn on international keyboards.

206
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
For example, if you turned on 
English, English (UK), German, 
and Japanese Kana (for a total of 4 
keyboards), tapping the globe icon 
switches from English to English 
(UK). Tapping it again switches 
to German, and tapping it again 
switches to Japanese Kana. Tapping 
the globe icon one more time 
switches back to English.
To use the Japanese Kana keyboard, 
use the keypad to select syllables. 
For more syllable options, tap the 
arrow key and select another syllable 
or word from the window. With the 
Japanese QWERTY keyboard, you 
can use the QWERTY layout to input 
code for Japanese syllables. As you 
type, suggested syllables appear, and 
you can tap the syllable to choose it.
Drawing Chinese 
Characters
The iPod touch offers keyboards for both Traditional and Simplified Chinese, 
with Handwriting and Pinyin layouts for both. Turn on international key-
boards as described in the preceding section and tap Chinese (Simplified) or 
Chinese (Traditional). Then tap Off to turn on Handwriting or Pinyin. (You 
can turn both on.) 
For the Handwriting layouts, use the touchpad to enter Chinese characters 
with your finger, as shown in Figure 15-4. 
As you draw character strokes, matching characters appear in a list, with the 
closest match at the top. When you choose a character, its related characters 
appear in the list as additional choices. 
For Simplified Pinyin, use the QWERTY keyboard to enter Pinyin for Chinese 
characters; as you type, suggested Chinese characters appear. Tap a charac-
ter to choose it or continue entering Pinyin to see more character options. 
Figure 15-3: Switch to another language.

Figure 15-4: Drawing Chinese characters.
Stopping a Wi-Fi Network From Joining
Your iPod touch remembers your Wi-Fi connections and automatically uses 
one when it detects it within your range. If you’ve used multiple Wi-Fi net-
works in the same location, it picks the last one you used. (For details on 
choosing a Wi-Fi network, see Chapter 4.)
But if your iPod touch keeps picking up a Wi-Fi network that you can’t prop-
erly join, such as a private network that requires a password you don’t know 
or a commercial network that charges for access, you can tell your iPod touch 
to forget this particular network, rather than turning off Wi-Fi itself. This is 
very useful if a paid service has somehow gotten hold of your iPod touch and 
won’t let you move on to other Web pages without typing a password.
Choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from the Home screen and tap the circled right-arrow 
(>) button next to the selected network’s name. The network’s information 
screen appears. Tap the Forget This Network button at the top of the screen 
so that your iPod touch doesn’t join it automatically. Then tap the Wi-Fi 
Networks button at the top-left corner to return to the Wi-Fi Networks screen. 
You can always select this network manually, and you can still continue to 
use other Wi-Fi networks.

Ten Apps That Shook 
the iPod World
In This Chapter
▶ Apps that show how an iPod touch can control your world
▶ Apps that demonstrate the iPod touch experience to the hilt
▶ Apps I use all the time that aren’t mentioned elsewhere in this book
I
t’s not fair. Only ten apps? As I write this, over 50,000 apps from almost as 
many software companies are competing for attention in the App Store. I 
could write an entire book about just the ones that have shaken my world — 
right down to the very routines I live by. (Maybe they’ll let me write that 
book in the future.) Instead, the publisher dragged me kicking and 
screaming to the back of the book, and told me we’d run out 
of room and that we had to keep it to ten.
How did I pick these ten? I included apps I think are 
important as an introduction to the iPod touch ex-
perience, along with the apps that I use every day.
I left out of this list the ones I’ve already described 
in other chapters and on the Cheat Sheet of this 
book — Facebook, MySpace, Twitterific, Skype, 
and the messaging apps (Chapter 13); Google Earth 
(Chapter 12); Wikipanion and other wiki readers 
(Chapter 10); Pandora, Truveo, and other apps that 
stream video (Chapter 8); PocketGuitar and other apps 
that help you make music (Chapter 7); a variety of games 
that use time (Chapter 3) or the accelerometer (Chapter 2); 
and the apps for fun and travel (Cheat Sheet). I also left out, of 
course, Apple’s apps that are supplied with the iPod touch. And yet, all 
of these apps, and especially the ones from Apple, are responsible for shak-
ing up the iPod world.

210
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Remote
The Remote app from Apple (free) turns your iPod touch into a remote con-
trol for iTunes and Apple TV. It was the first app to demonstrate how the 
iPod touch could be transformed by software into a completely different 
functional handheld device. The Remote app works with your Wi-Fi network, 
so you can control playback from anywhere in and around your home.
Enigmo
Voted the best game at the 2008 Worldwide Developers Conference and 
winner of various awards, Enigmo (not free) is a unique 3D puzzle game in 
which you direct animated flowing streams of water, oil, and lava, using your 
iPod touch to move and rotate the various puzzle pieces in order to divert 
the flow of the falling droplets so that they can reach their target.
Tap Tap Revenge
With a name obviously inspired by Japan’s megapopular Dance Dance 
Revolution, the original Tap Tap Revenge (free) takes its cues from the addic-
tive Guitar Hero, putting your rhythmic skills to the test. You tap through 
the beats of the music or shake left and right as the arrows fall. Tap Tap 
Revenge 2, also free, offers more than 150 free tracks to download as well as 
an immersive 3D experience.
Flick Fishing
Okay all you old-timers, bait those hooks! Flick Fishing’s animated environ-
ment all but puts the “Gone fishing” sign on your office door. Flick Fishing 
(not free) lets you cast a line with just a flick of your wrist and reel it in, but 
you have to be careful to avoid snapping the “line” and losing the “fish.” Of 
course, larger fish are stronger and not so easily reeled in.
Ocarina
By far the most famous of strange new iPhone apps that defy characteriza-
tion, Ocarina (not free) — the app that turns your iPhone into an ancient, 
flute-like instrument and lets you share the music you make with others — 

211
 Chapter 16: Ten Apps That Shook the iPod World
now works with the iPod touch as well. Without any musical training, you 
can touch the holes of the ocarina to make music or blow into an external 
microphone.
iBeer
It would be remiss of me to not include the best of the sight gag (and sound 
gag) apps. Although I’m not a fan of embarrassing noises, I do like visual 
gags, and iBeer (not free) has taken the lead in downloads. Your iPod touch 
behaves, well, like a glass of beer. It takes full advantage of the accelerometer 
so that you can tilt to sip from it, shake for more foam, and even pour beer 
from one iPod touch to another.
Google Mobile
Searching with Google has always been part of Safari (see Chapter 10). 
Google Mobile (free) provides instant access to Google Search, Gmail, Google 
News, Docs, Calendar, Talk, and other Google apps. You get relevant search 
suggestions as you type, and you can use location search to find businesses, 
services, weather, and movie info, and then see these suggestions on Google 
Maps.
Mobile News
Don’t like the news you read in the papers? Rather than going out and making 
some of your own, try The AP Mobile News Network app (free) — powered 
by the Associated Press — which offers access to local and national news 
from trusted sources. AP is typically the source for many newspaper articles. 
I read all my news on my iPod touch: It’s free, it saves paper, and it’s updated 
more frequently.
Stanza
The Stanza app (free) changed my reading habits — I not only read more 
classics (which are mostly free), but I also read everywhere I go. You can 
download a vast selection of over 50,000 free classics and over 50,000 con-
temporary works and read them right on your iPod touch. Sort by title or 
author or create custom collections to build reading lists and keep track of 
all your books. Although other readers have appeared (notably the Amazon 
Kindle Reader and eReader), Stanza is my favorite.

Tony’s Tips
Tony’s Tips for iPhone Users Manual (not free), developed and published by 
yours truly, is an app that provides helpful tips for using your iPhone or iPod 
touch with iTunes and MobileMe. I add new tips and revise the information 
regularly as Apple updates the software — the information is online, and the 
app that connects to it lets you search for and read topics and save pages for 
offline reading.
