About the Authors
Dennis C. Brewer is also the author of Security Controls for Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 404 IT Compliance: Authorization, Authentication, and Access (Wiley).
He earned a BSBA degree from Michigan Technological University and a
Novell Network Engineer Certification, and he spent over a dozen years as an
information technology specialist with the state of Michigan. Over the last
ten years, Dennis has worked on networking and computer technology pro-
jects from the level of hands-on integration, maintenance, and operations to
developing policy and charting future direction. He retired from his position
as an information technology security solutions specialist in January 2006
from the state of Michigan, Department of Information Technology, Office of
Enterprise Security. He currently operates his own IT consulting practice and
works on additional book projects.
Dennis’s on-the-ground and on-the-sea experience with electricity, wiring, build-
ing design, and construction, repairing, and maintenance includes 12 years in
the U.S. Navy Reserve (where he attained the rank and rating of Chief Petty
Officer, Interior Communications Electrician) and 12 years in the Michigan
National Guard as a Combat Engineer Officer (which he retired from as a
Captain in 1993).
Dennis currently resides in the quiet little town of Laurium, in the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan, with his wife, Penny. Their shared hobbies and pas-
times include reading, camping in the “little house,” biking, walking when
weather permits, and auto rides in sun, rain, sleet, or snow through the high-
ways and byways of the Keweenaw peninsula (which almost always includes
sightings of white-tailed deer, an occasional black bear or wolf, or a bald
eagle busying itself “fishing” the mouth of the Eagle River, where it empties
into Lake Superior). Dennis says, “There is nothing more rewarding than
watching the sun set over the big lake after an engaging afternoon of writing,
except for maybe helping someone install a home network!”
Paul A. Brewer has earned a state of Michigan Masters Electrician License
and Michigan Residential Builders License. He studied electrical engineering
at Michigan Technological University, in Houghton, Michigan. He is currently
the vice president of the electrical contracting firm of All Systems Electric
(run by his sons) located in Ishpeming, Michigan, and he also works on writ-
ing projects. 
While in the U.S. Navy, Paul worked on electro-mechanical systems of the
submarines of the Sunshine Squadron out of Key West Florida and later out of
Charleston, South Carolina, as an Interior Communications Electrician Petty
Officer Second Class. He also worked as an expediter for a general contractor
and as an electrician in several states. For the final three years that Callahan
Mining Company operated the Ropes Gold Mine near Ishpeming, he ran the

electrical department for a developing underground mine; he also ran his
own electrical contracting firm from 1976 to 2005. While at the Ropes Gold
Mine, he designed and built an automatic control system that was CCTV mon-
itored and could load skips by remote control. In addition, he maintained the
high- and low-voltage distribution systems and the dewatering pumps as they
advanced deeper with the mine’s descent. In his contracting business, he has
completed wiring projects that included department stores, offices, restau-
rants, homes, saw mills, and roller mills. On off-the-grid sites, he has installed
generators, solar panels, and battery-powered inverter systems, which
includes volunteering his time to the U.S. National Park of Isle Royal to install
a solar-inverter–powered system on the beautiful island national park in Lake
Superior.
Paul currently resides in the city of Ishpeming, Michigan, in the Upper
Peninsula. He takes advantage of the area’s seasonal amenities: skiing, skat-
ing, and — when the freeze precedes the snow — clears off the lake in front
of his house to share the rink, where everyone is welcome to skate. Presque
Isle Park in Marquette is a favorite place to ski in the winter. In the summer,
he hits the rollerblade trails and concerts in the park. Paul says, “The park
deer population in past years included two albino deer, which once cooper-
ated by showing themselves when I took my only sister, Peggy, and her hus-
band, Joe, to see them.”
Dedication
Paul A. Brewer: I dedicate this book to our late brother, Edward Leslie
Brewer. Ed, the oldest of us five children, was the spark that ignited our inter-
est in the subject of electricity. As an extensive reader of all matters, Ed’s
knowledge of the electrical code book is best described as “a walking code
book.” When I first started in the business, he steered me to the right track
by freely and enthusiastically giving me the code-compliant way to do a job.
In later years, I still found good advice upon request and sometimes it came
unsolicited. I do miss him.
Dennis C. Brewer: This book is dedicated to all those (too many to count or
mention by name) who showed me how to actually do or make something
with hand tools, power tools, and motorized equipment — particularly to my
older brothers, Edward, Alfred, and Paul for their early encouragement
toward learning to use tools and the trades. I also dedicate this book to those
who want to learn how to do new things and pass that fresh knowledge, skill,
or ability on to someone else who could benefit from the doing.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Paul A. Brewer: I would like to thank my family for their support, acknowl-
edging my three beautiful daughters and their spouses: Joyce and Joe, Paula
and Dave, and Sandy. I would especially thank my two sons, Gary (and his
wife Lisa), and Ricky, who both by chance also happen to be electricians, for
helping me with this book. I received help from many vendors; the vendors
that went out of their way to be of assistance, include Rex TV, Midwest Security,
and Wal-Mart, all of Marquette, MI. I want to thank the owners, as well as the
contractors, of the many projects we wired and photographed. Our electrical
suppliers were very helpful, especially Joe Rahoi at Prime Supply and Holly
Bluebaugh, Scott Schwenke, and Paul Klarich at UP Electric Supply. I am grate-
ful to my friend, John Wirtanen, for the entertaining tales he tells and also for
the wisdom and water that I received at his establishment.
Dennis C. Brewer: Thanks to my wife, Penny, for her relentless patience and
support; my friend Joe, for always asking the tough technical questions; my
oldest son, Jason, for the inspiration to always do quality work; my youngest
son, Justin, for pointing out that sometimes designs need to go a little bit out-
side of the lines; and my mother, Verna, for reminding me recently that find-
ing the right answer to a problem is worth some degree of celebration.
I want to thank the many electrical, electronic, and networking product 
vendors and sales representatives who answered or found answers to my
questions. They know who they are because I will give each of them a copy o
f this book!
From both authors: Thanks to our literary agent, Carole McClendon, at
Waterside Productions for all of her valued assistance with this project.

Introduction
T
housands of years ago, a home was little more than a sheltered place in
which to sleep. Later, indoor fireplaces and ovens allowed people to cook
inside their homes. In recent centuries, homes sprouted washrooms and sinks,
thanks to indoor plumbing, and in the last 100 years, electrical and telephone
systems have become standard features.
Homes have come a long way since their humble beginnings as crude shel-
ters. In the 21st century, digital lifestyles will influence home design as never
before. The modern home is a place for high-fidelity entertainment, advanced
communications, and automated convenience. This book shows you how to
bring your home into the new millennium. We show you how to install whole-
home remote controls, cable TV systems, computer networks, public address
systems, multi-room sound, backup power, and the latest phone systems.
Wiring Your Digital Home For Dummies offers illustrations, diagrams, and 
job-site photographs to help you better understand the sometimes complex
wiring topics. We’ve packed this book with practical advice on what to include
in new-home designs and techniques that work whether you’re building a
new home or updating an existing one. Even if you’re not a do-it-yourselfer,
this book helps you better understand digital systems, allowing you to make
more informed decisions as you work with your architect or builder.
About This Book
If you’ve ever started a sentence with, “I wish my home were wired for (insert
fantasy here),” then Wiring Your Digital Home For Dummies is for you! This
book is organized into parts and chapters, creating the framework that builds
and binds the book together. You needn’t approach the book in one single
way — we expect that you will jump from section to section based upon your
needs and plans.
We wrote this book both with the construction trade professional and the
novice in mind. For the do-it-yourselfer, we’ve packed in lessons learned from
a combined 80-plus years of working as electricians, technicians, and com-
puter and networking geeks. We hope you can relate to these lessons as you
complete your projects.

If you’re a professional, Wiring Your Digital Home For Dummies provides a
heads-up on features you may want to include in the next home you wire, and
it gives some insights about what your residential customers will ask you to
do in the days and years to come. For builders, architects, engineers, design-
ers, and electricians, this book is not only a reference but also a marketing
checklist. As a builder, use it to work with the buyer the next time you’re asked
to quote a price for a new home. Electrical contractors will want to use this
book when working with the builder to offer options in the wiring contract.
Conventions Used in This Book
When we refer to or paraphrase some section of the code, we mean the
National Electrical Code (NEC) sponsored by the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA). Often we use the word must without referring specifically
to the code. This usually means either the code requires it or the circuit
won’t work correctly any other way. Wiring to code means meeting a mini-
mum standard. Most of the time this minimum standard is sufficient.
In some cases, we refer you to helpful resources on the Internet. Web
addresses are printed this way: www.wiley.com.
What You Don’t Have to Read
It’s perfectly okay to skip items you already know or don’t care about. For
example, if you already know the code inside and out, then you can probably
skip stuff that is marked with the Code Stuff icon (although we think that a
quick refresher is always a good idea).
In some cases we include sidebars, which provide nice-to-know information.
Sidebars don’t contain critical information, so you can safely skip them if
they don’t meet your current need.
And finally, it’s a good idea to read all paragraphs marked with Warning icons.
The information in those paragraphs is critical and will prevent mistakes that
could cost you — or hurt you.
Foolish Assumptions
Whether you know nothing about wiring, everything about wiring, or you’re
somewhere in between, all we assume about you is that you want to better
2
Wiring Your Digital Home For Dummies 

understand modern home wiring and how best to make it work with digital-age
conveniences. You might be looking to build a new home or planning to upgrade
your existing home. You might be an architect or engineer responsible for
designing and selecting parts for someone else’s home. You may be a builder 
or electrician looking to market digital-home features in your future jobs.
Whatever your reason for picking up this book, we think that when you’re
done reading you’ll be in a better position to articulate and act on your own
ideas and specific needs as you work to create your ideal digital home.
How This Book Is Organized
As electricians and technicians, we’re very interested in the parts that make
up the whole of the house wiring job. A home works well only when all its
systems and subsystems work in harmony with one another. Every technical
job eventually comes down to nuts and bolts, pieces and parts, step one fol-
lowed by step two, and tab A going onto slot B. Our entire wired world is
based on bringing the right parts together at the right time in the right way.
Like wiring systems, this book is an assembly of parts that work together to
make the whole. The parts, chapters, and topics break subjects down into
bite-size pieces that you can easily use.
Although each part and chapter covers a unique topic, you may notice some
overlapping subject material. We did this so you catch the complementary
relationships between such things as (for example) security alarms and sur-
veillance cameras.
Use the table of contents or index to skim for topics of immediate concern or
to refresh yourself on information of interest after your first read. This book
can be a valuable reference as you work though projects for many years to
come. The table of contents, chapter titles, section headings, and icons help
you quickly find the information you’re seeking.
Part I: Installing Power Distribution 
and Basic Wiring
Regardless of where your electrical power is coming from — a potato, a coin
battery, or the power company — you need to get the power to the place that
most needs it, and you must keep it under control at all times. The same goes
for phone service and other systems. The chapters in Part I provide the
groundwork for bringing the wires into your home and then distributing them
to your various living spaces.

Introduction

 Chapter 1: Use this chapter to reach out for your digital future and 
find inspiration for planning your new digital home or next remodeling
project. This chapter also provides tips on selecting a contractor, and
we show you which tools you’ll need.
 Chapter 2: From the red tape of building permits to dealing with the
power company, this chapter is all about getting services to your home,
be it power, phone, cable, or Internet. We show you how to set up tem-
porary services at a construction site, and how to install permanent ser-
vice entrances and distribution panels for power, phone, and cable TV.
 Chapter 3: This chapter tells you how to get the right kind of wires to
the lights, phones, TVs, and computers in every nook and cranny of
your home.
 Chapter 4: Bare electrical wiring isn’t pretty or safe. This chapter shows
you how to make the final connections, install attractive trim, and make
sure everything works perfectly.
 Chapter 5: Written for the control enthusiast in all of us, this chapter
explains why you will need a 100-pocket vest to carry all of the remote
controls for your home. No, not really. But Chapter 5 does help you get
complete control of anything electrical, including lights and appliances.
Part II: Adding Communication, 
Audio, and Video Systems
Part II covers the convenience and luxury items that help you get the most
enjoyment out of your investment.
 Chapter 6: In this chapter we chat with you about phone stuff, including
traditional analog systems as well as digital, Internet-based phone sys-
tems. We show you how to install a home telephone exchange system
that lets you make calls from the kitchen to the garage, and we show
how to use your Internet service to affordably call distant relatives and
friends. This is the quintessential chit-chat cheaply chapter.
 Chapter 7: This chapter discusses intercom systems that let you ask
who’s at the door while you’re in the kitchen and push a button to let
Mr. McMahon in with the million-dollar check, if it’s really him.
 Chapter 8: This chapter is all about the wiring that brings entertainment
to a video screen near you. We show how to run TV cable throughout the
home while maintaining great video-signal strength. We also introduce
home fiber optic services, which are becoming increasingly available.

cations services beyond the confines of your home’s wall to outbuild-
ings and outdoor living spaces.
 Chapter 17: This chapter briefly covers some additional ways to bring
network and other services to the outdoor landscape. We also show you
how to build your own driveway traffic light as a just-for-fun project.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Following the standard For Dummies roadmap, we included a Part of Tens. In
fact, we liked the idea so much that we included three full chapters of Tens,
making this really a Part of 30. These chapters are a ready reference long
after you’ve read the rest of the book ten times.
 Chapter 18: This chapter takes you away on a World Wide Web search
to ten of our favorite wiring and digital technology Web sites. Expect to
find lots of great online information and links to even more helpful sites.

so be sure to read this chapter before you pull your first foot of wire.
 Chapter 20: At some time in your life (if it hasn’t happened already),
you’ll be inundated with requests for assistance. Someone is bound to
ask you for help; you might even have a problem of your very own to
solve. When that happens, bring Chapter 20 to the rescue with its ten
universal troubleshooting tips.
Part VII: Appendixes
This part of the book contains the appendixes, which is where we stuck infor-
mation that was important but didn’t fit in the rest of the book.
 Appendix A: This appendix provides a list of product sources, showing
you where to go to find the supplies you need for any wiring project.
 Appendix B: This appendix delves into electrical theory, wire proper-
ties, and provides ampacity tables from the National Electrical Code.
 Appendix C: This appendix gives you an overview of what’s on the CD
that’s included with this book. It also provides installation instructions.

Icons Used in This Book
We use various icons in the margins to help organize some of the material
and identify our intentions.
Whenever you see the Tip icon, it’s our way of keeping your forehead some-
what rounded. If you don’t read these tips, you may flatten your forehead
with repeated smacking as you keep saying, “Now, why didn’t I think of that?”
Tips are our way of putting you and your project on the fast track to comple-
tion, with less effort and (hopefully) fewer mistakes.
If this book included quiz questions, paragraphs next to the Remember icon
are the answers. We repeat these important things because they’re worth
remembering.
If you watch racing events, you’re likely familiar with the caution flag. When
this flag comes out, it’s time to slow down and look for speed bumps, oil
slicks, or debris ahead. The Warning icon is our caution flag. Think of these
as must-read items. Once you read and understand these warnings, the green
flag will be out for you on the next turn.
Sometimes you feel like you’re in the know, and sometimes you don’t. When
you want to know more about the whys, hows, and wherefores of the techni-
cal side of home wiring, read these technical background and detail exposé
items with wild-hearted expectation. Or feel free to skip them altogether.
Whenever you see this icon, pay particular attention to ensure that you follow
the rules laid down by the building authority. In most cases the code we refer
to is the NEC sponsored by the NFPA, which is adopted as the law of the land
by code-enforcement authorities all over the United States (and even some
other countries). We believe the code authors meant for you to do things the
way they’re explained in Code Stuff paragraphs. Whenever in doubt about a
code question, check the latest code book or handbook, a licensed electrical
professional, or consult with the governing code-enforcement authority.
Where to Go from Here
Although we don’t recommend pulling out sections of the book to reorder the
chapters, you can read them in any order you like. If you’re a total wiring
novice, you probably want to start with the first four chapters. They provide
a foundation of knowledge, skills, and abilities that support the rest of the
book (and the rest of your work). After that, follow your muse (or your imme-
diate construction plans) to the topics that interest you most.

A
esthetically, a digital home is a warm, welcoming abode — a place
where you love to spend time and enjoy life with your family and close
friends. The digital home has just the right lighting in every space, whether
that space is used for reading, computing, or a favorite hobby. A digital home
is a place where technology enhances and eases your lifestyle and maximizes
the enjoyment of your surroundings. A modern digital home is a habitat where
elements of shape, infrastructure, and control combine to meet your needs
with a maximum of convenience.
Functionally, a digital home is one that takes full advantage of the latest tech-
nologies for electronics, networking, communications, and electromechanical
devices. The well-wired contemporary digital home also anticipates coming
advances and adapts easily to future changes. Each digital home is unique,
tailored to the needs and desires of the individual homeowner; yet a well
thought-out digital home contains wiring and electronic equipment that
meets accepted standards of construction and design.
Are you ready to start planning your digital home? This chapter shows you
some of the benefits of a digital home and gets you started with the designing
and planning process. We go over some of the features you may want to incor-
porate and help you decide whether you want to be your own contractor.

Living on Digital Easy Street
Close your eyes and imagine yourself in the ultimate digital home. It’s
Saturday and no one has to go to work or school. You are awakened to a sun-
drenched morning by the quietly rising sound of a string quartet playing a
classic movement by Tchaikovsky. As you enter the bathroom, the lights
come up to a warm glow automatically. The sink water is instantly warm with
the first twist of the 24-carat gold-plated faucet as you wash your face and
take care of dental hygiene. After you emerge from your shower, the rack-
warmed towels are an arm’s reach away.
The kitchen welcomes you with the fresh wafting aroma of Tanzanian pea-
berry coffee, and your favorite morning news show tunes in on the flip-down
television screen the instant you enter the breakfast nook. After the news,
you walk out to the patio and read the newspaper editorials. As you leave the
kitchen space, the TV turns off automatically. It is a sunny morning but still a
little chilly outside, so you press a remote control button to light the gas fire-
place and kick on its built-in circulation fan. As the rising sun warms the
morning air, you press another button to turn off the fireplace.
It’s a nice morning, so you pull out your hand-held computer and type a few
e-mails, which you send via your wireless network. Later, you use the PC
workstation in your kitchen to copy some digital photos from your camera
and send them to grandma in Arizona. While online, you check the local
Doppler weather radar image to see if any clouds are in the area. There are
none, so you decide to take a walk in the park.
When you return home in the evening, you find that the microwave has just
cooked a light dinner moments before your return. Later, you watch a newly
released DVD in your home theater. After the movie the auto-vac-bot begins
its quest for stray popcorn fragments, gliding almost silently across the floor.
Lights in rooms and hallways sense your presence and automatically turn on
and off as you pass through, ready to turn in for the night.
The scenario presented here illustrates just some of the possibilities of the
modern digital home. Your dream home may look a little different, but with
proper planning the possibilities are virtually limitless. The next few sections
help you start your plan for your own digital home.
12
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Planning Your Digital Dream Home
It may seem easier to design and build your digital dream home from the
ground up, but any home can be adapted to include modern wiring, controls,
appliances, computers, and other technology. As you start planning your digi-
tal home, you need to consider several factors:
 Budget: What can you afford? Does your home have enough space for
the features you want?
 Features: Make a list of the features you want.
 Appliance locations and sizes: Choose where you want certain appli-
ances, and determine what size each appliance should be.
 Outlets: Determine the type, location, and number of outlets you need
before construction begins.
Define your requirements in writing to help focus you and your contractor on
meeting the design objectives. Page though this book chapter by chapter,
taking note of the items you want to include in your own digital home. Also,
go through each room in your home (or your home plan) and make a list of
features you want in each of those rooms. Be specific in your plan, because it
influences the wiring installed in each room.
Designing for new construction
When building new homes, contractors often tend to do things the way they
have done them in previous homes. As the homeowner of a new house — or
a do-it-yourselfer building your own home — it is absolutely critical that you
 Include your digital home plans in the design specifications.
 Communicate to everyone involved the need for neatness and attention
to detail.
For example, wiring runs should be made so that they minimize crosstalk
(interference between power supply wires and communication wires).
Different wiring types should have adequate separation, particularly on long
parallel runs.
The NEC (National Electrical Code) requires a minimum separation of 4" between
communication cables and open conductor power wires. (Open conductor is a
wiring system used prior to the 1950s and is often referred to as knob and tube
13
Chapter 1: Designing Your Digital Dream Home

wiring.) To minimize crosstalk, however, we recommend at least 6" between
communication cables and any type of power wires. More separation is better.
Remodeling an existing residence
Homeowners often undertake remodeling projects involving one or two
rooms. If you’re planning a project, consider rewiring and including addi-
tional elements that can take advantage of newer technology.
The demolition and removal of old wiring, fixtures, and equipment is an
added cost to consider when undertaking a remodeling project. If you aban-
don wires because they cannot be fully removed, take extra care to ensure
that those abandoned wires cannot be accidentally reenergized later. To do
this, cut the wires off flush with the box surface they protrude through, or 
cut them off in a few places along their route.
When planning your remodeling project, schedule the work so that one trade
is not too far ahead of or behind the others. If you’re working with a contrac-
tor, make sure he takes this into account. For example, the rough-in wiring
must be done and the boxes mounted before new drywall is started. Pay
close attention to the timeline and to job dependencies.
Completing single-focus projects
You may not have the time or budget to build, remodel, or upgrade your entire
home to accommodate a digital lifestyle all at once. Instead, you may want to
focus on one living space or one project at a time. Perhaps you have become
serious about getting all the value possible from your home computers and
want to build a home network to share Internet connections, printers, and fax
services. Or maybe you’re not satisfied with only two separate smoke alarms
in the whole house. Situations like this make for perfect single-focus projects.
You can complete many a project without major destruction and reconstruc-
tion. We show you some of these projects in Chapters 11 and 17.
Regardless of your project scope, include
 Starting with the floor plan, then onto the fixture, appliance, and furni-
ture layouts, in that order, to determine where the wiring infrastructure
will go.
 Separating different wiring types.
 Planning routes for power and communication cabling before drilling.
14
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

 Specifying exact locations for appliances, utilities, services, and outlet
boxes.
 Planning racks, shelves, and mountings.
 Purchasing or gathering the required tools and equipment.
 Accounting for any job dependencies and the necessary work sequence.
 Determining how your plan alternatives affect the overall budget.
 Visiting the site often to ensure your plans are being implemented 
properly.
Choosing the Contractor — 
or Being Your Own
When using a professional contractor, the most important thing (besides
writing the check) is knowing what you want included in your home and
articulating your needs accurately to a reputable builder or contractor.
Defining the work is the same whether you decide to go the do-it-yourself
route or hire a contractor. And, of course, you need to choose a competent
contractor.
Selecting a contractor
“How,” you wonder, “can I be sure I am choosing the right builder or contrac-
tor for my project?” Thanks for asking! Table 1-1 offers some of the things to
consider asking or finding out about your prospective contractor.

the contractor who says, “Oh, I didn’t know you
wanted x, y, and z done, too. That’s going to cost
an arm and a leg.” Know his schedule before
you sign — when he will start and when he
expects to finish.

Find out what your state laws are regarding worker’s compensation. If the
contractor on your project doesn’t have insurance, you may become liable
for any on-the-job injuries experienced by workers on your project.
Being your own contractor
Doing major construction work is not for the timid . . . well, not for the too
timid, anyway. If you already have the skills and some experience, the deci-
sion to be your own contractor may be easier. If this is your first construction
or remodeling project and you are willing to learn, the knowledge you gain
will lead to increased confidence tackling future projects as well. The bottom
line is this: Can you cheerfully take full responsibility for the outcome? If so,
then you are ready to begin.
Adequate preparation is often the only thing that separates the professional
from the do-it-yourselfer. One expects a professional electrician or network
installer to come to a job site equipped with the time, talent, tools, pieces
(screws, nails, brackets, and the like), and important parts needed to get the
job done in one quick visit. The do-it-yourselfer, on the other hand, usually
has to run to the hardware store often for special tools or extra parts.
Careful planning can prevent delays. Visualize yourself doing the work one
step at a time. Collect all of the tools and equipment you need beforehand,
along with the components, wire, hardware, and other things you need to
finish the task. Use your project plan to make a list of the things you need,
and check the items off the list as you buy them.
Gathering Tools and Equipment
You’re going to need a lot of tools — some basic, some specialized — to com-
plete your project. Some of these tools are worth owning so they’re readily
available for minor repairs. You may want to rent more expensive, seldom-
used power equipment, especially in the case of specialty tools like heavy-
duty cement saws or core drills. The following sections list some of the hand
tools, power tools, and test equipment that you need as you build and main-
tain your digital home.
Hand tools
Acquiring more hand tools is usually a good thing, because they typically get
used a lot. Before you become your own contractor you will need to own or
have access to a basic issue of hand tools, including
18
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

 8" diagonal wire cutter
 9" lineman’s pliers
 Stubby and long-handled screwdrivers for each of the following sizes: #2
phillips, 1⁄8", 1⁄4", and 3⁄8" flat-blade
 Wire stripper
 Cable stripper
 Hack saw and assorted blades
 Hole saw
 RJ-45 (Ethernet cable) crimper/cutter
 RG-6 (coaxial TV cable) crimper
 Bubble level
 Folding ruler and tape measure
Power tools
In addition to a basic set of hand tools, you need some power tools. Power
tools can be expensive, but the ones listed here are used so frequently that
you should own them.
 Drill: Look for a drill that can make it through 2" × 4" framing and 2" × 8"
floor joists. A right-angle power drill is best because the right angle gives
you leverage against the twisting action, making drilling easier and safer.
 Hammer drill: This comes in handy when mounting service panels and
backboards to masonry or concrete. If you don’t want to invest in a
hammer drill, you can also use a .20-caliber power fastener.
 Circular saw: Find a saw with comfortable grips for both hands so you
can easily control the cut.
 Rechargeable battery-powered screw gun: This tool is handy for
drilling screws to quickly mount junction boxes and other items. Make
sure you have an assortment of driver tips, including a lot of extra
Phillips head tips; they are used most frequently.
 Reciprocating saw: With a reciprocating saw and carbide blades, many
tough cutting jobs become no more difficult than cutting cold butter.
 Expendable items: Shop for drill bits, assorted machine bits, and 3⁄4", 1",
and 11⁄2" ship augers. To drill though floor joists purchase 11⁄2", 2", and 21⁄2"
self-feed bits. You also need extra hack saw blades, work gloves, eye pro-
tection (goggles or a clear face mask), HEPA dust mask and filters, and a
fully stocked first-aid kit.

Chapter 1: Designing Your Digital Dream Home

Test equipment
You need a multimeter, and need to decide between digital and analog:
 Digital multimeters come with a selector switch to measure AC/DC volt-
ages, ohms, or low-amperage currents. This version is inexpensive and
popular.
 Analog multimeters come with a selector switch for measuring voltage,
ohms, and current. Analog makes a better troubleshooting tool, partly
because you don’t have to constantly digest the changing digits.
You also need these goodies:
 Neon test light
 Low-voltage test light/continuity tester
 Category 5 network cable tester

 Putting in your electrical service
I
f you want to fill your home with a lot of cool digital gadgets, it goes with-
out saying that your house must be connected to an electrical power
source. Technology doesn’t run on magic beans.
You have to equip your home with an electrical distribution system to sup-
port your digital lifestyle. The distribution system — generally referred to as
your electrical service — receives big power from the utility company (unless
you use an alternative power source) and splits it into usable chunks. You
must choose the service’s location and proper size, and then get all the
required permits. Other considerations, such as whether you install over-
head or underground service, may be up to you or your power company.
This chapter helps you plan for and install your electrical service. It also
introduces the equipment you’ll use, explains some electrical terms, and
looks at how electrical power is produced and sent to your home.
Understanding the Power You Need
As you probably already know, most electricity is generated at power plants.
Those plants typically run on coal, natural gas, nuclear power, hydroelectric
generators, or hamster wheels. The electricity is transmitted to your local
power company, which then distributes it to individual customers like your-
self. Most likely, your home is fed by 60-cycle 120/240-volt alternating current
(AC). What does this mean? Read on.

Alternating stuff
When a power plant generates power, it does so by rotating a magnet so that
it passes by a coil. The voltage rises as the magnet nears the coil, then
decays as the magnet continues past the coil. As the magnet’s opposite pole
nears the coil, the voltage builds in the opposite direction. (Voltage is
explained in the next section.) The voltage mimics a sine wave like the one
illustrated in Figure 2-1, and is said to be alternating current because it alter-
nates between positive and negative; first the electrons flow in one direction
through the circuit and then in the opposite direction. When the current
alternates 60 times per second, it is called 60 cycle. By the way, these cycles
are also called Hertz, after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz, who was the
first person to artificially produce radio waves.
Current that doesn’t alternate between poles is called direct current (DC). DC
power flows in one direction. The current from a battery (from the one in
your car to the one in your iPod) is direct current.
Transforming current with transformers
When AC comes from the power company, it’s sent in thousands of volts.
Devices called transformers step that power down to the 120/240-volt power
used in your home. These transformers work on a simple ratio. A transformer
with 100 turns on the input coil (primary) and 10 turns on the output coil (sec-
ondary) has a 10:1 step-down ratio. For every 10 volts fed into the primary,
you get 1 volt out of the secondary. Transformers are reversible, meaning that
a transformer with a 10:1 ratio can step voltage up from 1 volt to 10 volts.
Because electricity has to travel long distances before getting to your home,
the power company uses transformers to lessen line loss. Most power is gen-
erated at 15–25 kilovolts (KV) and stepped as high as 236 KV for transmission
over long distances. The very high voltage is stepped down to a few thousand
volts in residential areas, and then further stepped down to 120/240 volts at
or near your home. If 236 volts are lost over the lines of the 236 KV system,
this represents a line loss of 1⁄10 of 1 percent. But if the system were a straight
240 volts from the supply to the point of use, you would wind up with only
4 volts in your home.
So, your power company supplies your home with transformed AC power.
However, most of the digital stuff in your home runs on DC power. This is why
you usually plug them into your AC power outlets with AC adapters, which
are power cords with small rectangular blocks on them. The block on an AC
adapter includes a transformer that steps down the 120-volt AC wall power to
a lower voltage, which varies depending on the device. The AC adapter also
includes a device called a rectifier, which converts AC voltage to DC voltage.

Amps and volts and other terms
Making the permanent connection to the electricity supplied by your power
company happens just once, so getting it done right is important. We recom-
mend that you invest some time in getting familiar with the terms and equip-
ment you need to do the job properly. It’s good to know this stuff, even if an
electrical contractor is doing the work for you, because you want to make

sure that you get an installation that will meet your home’s needs. Some of
the electrical terms you’ll encounter include:
 Amps: Short for amperes, a measurement of electrical current flow. Amps
measure the amount of current a conductor can carry. The measurement
also specifies the size (electrical capacity) of electrical items, such as a
100-amp panel or a 20-amp breaker.
 AWG (American wire gauge): The diameter of a wire. Wire diameter is
also expressed as the Brown and Sharpe Wire Gauge (B&S). To deter-
mine the actual diameter of a wire in mils (a mil is 0.001 inch) use 5 ×
92(36-AWG)/39. For sizes 1/0 through 4/0 use –1 to –4.
 CMA (circular mil area): The wire’s diameter is expressed in mils
squared. CMA helps determine how much current a conductor can
carry.
 Breaker: Common term for a circuit breaker. Circuit breakers close and
open circuits. Circuit breakers have current ratings in amps to denote
how many amps are allowed to pass before the breaker is tripped. When
a breaker trips, the circuit is open and no current flows.
 Conduit or cable: The medium by which you bring power from point to
point. Conduits or cables contain conductors (wires) that actually carry
the power.
 Current: The flow of electrical energy, as measured in amps.
 Distribution panel: The equipment that parcels out power to different
circuits and locations. This panel is also sometimes called a breaker
panel or service panel.
 Fuse: Works like a circuit breaker, but is a one-time-use device.
 Ground: Earth or connected to earth; this term also refers to the bare
ground conductors or wires with green insulation on the conductors.
The ground wires aren’t intended for carrying any current unless there’s
a fault condition. A ground wire’s purpose is threefold: to ensure the
breaker trips on a fault condition; to divert lightning strikes to ground;
and to protect the equipment user from becoming the path to ground.
 Grounded: Denotes something connected to ground. The white or neu-
tral conductor is referred to as the grounded conductor because the neu-
tral conductor is the only current-carrying conductor connected to
ground in the service-entrance panel. The difference between the ground
wire and the grounded conductor (or neutral wire) is that when every-
thing is working normally, the neutral wire carries the return current and
the ground wire carries no current at all.
 Grounding: The process or action of connecting to ground.
24
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

 Junction: The point where wires or cables are joined together. Junctions
are located in junction boxes with the exception of some outdoor cables.
Overhead services cables for example connect to the home’s entrance
cables without using a junction box.
 Meter: Watt-hour meter. The power company uses this device to mea-
sure your home’s power usage. Test meters also measure volts (volt-
meter), amps (ammeter), ohms (ohmmeter), or power factor meter.
 Meter socket: The box the power company uses to plug in its usage meter.
 Power: The product of volts multiplied by amps expressed in watts (W)
or volt amps (VA). The ungrounded conductors that carry power are
also sometimes called the power wires or energized conductors.
 Service: The conductors and equipment bringing power from the utility
to the premises’ service disconnect.
 Service disconnect: The one to six disconnects that interrupt all power
from the power company. This is usually a single main circuit breaker in
the service panel. If any disconnect is installed ahead of the service panel,
this disconnect then becomes the service disconnect and the service
panel becomes a branch panel.
 VA (volt amps): Measurement of power. VA is the product of volts times
amps.
 Volt: The international measurement of electrical potential. One volt is
the measurement of the electromotive force necessary to carry one amp
of current across a resistance of one ohm.
 Watt: The product of volts times amps in a DC circuit. In an AC circuit,
wattage is the product of volts times amps times the power factor.
25
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services
Fluorescent lights and rotating equipment
As we mention in this chapter, 60-cycle AC volt-
age actually goes to 0 volts 60 times per second.
When 60-cycle AC voltage is used to power fil-
ament lights (standard light bulbs), the filament
doesn’t cool off fast enough to go completely
dark. In early U.S. systems that used 25-cycle
current, a flicker could easily be seen in fila-
ment bulbs; 60-cycle AC current is too fast for
the eye to detect a flicker in filament lights.
Unlike filament lights, fluorescent lights actually
go out when the cycle crosses 0. When fluores-
cent lights illuminate rotating equipment — like
in a workshop or manufacturing plant — a
strobe condition can occur. (This effect is similar
to what you see in movies when wheels or pro-
peller blades seem to be turning backwards.
When this happens in movies, the frame speed
is nearly matched with the cycle of the rotating
item.) A rotating piece of equipment under a flu-
orescent light can appear to be standing still
when it is, in fact, turning. If you illuminate your
work area with fluorescent lights, either take
extra care around spinning tools and equipment
or consider using filament lights instead.

Meeting Power Company
and Code Requirements
You’re going to have to jump through some hoops to get power to your home.
We’ve worked in various jurisdictions all over the United States, and the only
thing they have in common is that they’re all different. The only way to sort
out your exact requirements is to make phone calls or personal visits to your
power company’s building code office and meet with the building inspectors.
The following sections help you ask the right questions of the regulatory offi-
cials when you talk to them.
Getting permitted
A homeowner can do his own wiring in his own home without hiring a
licensed electrical contractor. In most areas, or jurisdictions, the owner must
be living in the home or intend to live in the home. Minor electrical work —
such as replacing a single outlet or installing a new ceiling fan — doesn’t
require a permit in most jurisdictions. But if you do more extensive work,
you’re usually required to get a permit. The process usually goes as follows:
1. Find the authority that has jurisdiction, which can be your
• Township
• City
• County
• State
• Tribe
The quickest way to find the right jurisdiction is to start at the lowest
level, either township or city. If they don’t perform the inspections they
can refer you to who does. The power company serving your area may
know this information.
2. You fill out the required form and take it, or mail it, along with the
permit fee, to the authority.
Some jurisdictions have the forms available online.
3. The authority reviews the form, accepts your money, and issues the
permit.
Mailed permits are sometimes returned for additional information. Make
sure you fill in the form completely.
26
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Some jurisdictions have a flat fee for a new construction home-wiring
project. In some jurisdictions, you have to itemize the number of cir-
cuits, receptacles, fixtures, and so forth to determine the inspection fee.
4. The electrical inspector visits your project site and checks the work.
If a discrepancy (code violation) is found, you’re notified in person, by
phone, or in writing; you’re told how and when to correct the problem. A
new home may have four or more inspections, one each for temporary
power, electrical service, electrical rough in, and electrical final (trim
out). Each of these inspections may require one or more follow-up
inspections, extending the total to eight or more.
Installing in light of code requirements
When you install electrical service for a home, whether it’s new construction
or an upgrade, the electrical code requires that you do a load calculation to
determine the correct size for your electrical service. Most jurisdictions
don’t enforce this requirement, but for safety’s sake it’s worth doing. The
minimum service size allowed to supply a residence is one that carries a total
electrical load of 100 amps. With all the circuits needed in a modern home,
we recommend installing a 200-amp service panel with 40 circuits unless the
load calculations require a larger one.
Load is calculated in volt amps (VA), which is the product of volts times amps.
For a residence, the load calculation includes a general lighting load of 3 VA per
square foot of habitable space, plus any additional loads present. For the ser-
vice load, the first 3,000 VA are calculated at 100-percent usage and any remain-
ing load is calculated at 35-percent usage. The usage percentages are called
demand factors. Demand factors are applied because it’s unlikely everything
will be on at the same time. If the load calculation is in excess of 120,000 VA, the
demand factor is 25 percent for the remainder of the load in excess of 120,000
VA. You must also add in a minimum small-appliance load of 3,000 VA for the
kitchen and 1,500 VA for the laundry. The results are added to determine the
total calculated load.
Table 2-1 shows a sample load calculation for a 2,000-square-foot home. As
you can see in the table, the total calculated load is 19,125 VA. To determine
the minimum amperage you need for your electrical service, divide the calcu-
lated VA load by 240, which is typical residential voltage:
19,125 VA ÷ 240 volts = 79.69 amps
The sample load calculation in Table 2-1 calculates 2,000 square feet at 3 VA
per square foot equaling 6,000 VA and adds the two kitchen circuits (3,000 VA
plus the 1,500 VA laundry circuit). All of these total 10,500 VA. By code, only
27
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

the first 3,000 VA of this 10,500 load is calculated at 100-percent usage. By
using the allowed demand factor, the remaining 7,500 VA is calculated at 35
percent adding 2,625 VA to the load and yielding a subtotal load of 5,625 VA.
In addition to the calculations, we have included an 8,000-VA load for the
electric range and a 5,500-VA load for the electric dryer. Adding these loads
brings a total of 19,125 VA. If the range or dryer were gas, you’d eliminate
them from the calculation. If your project has any additional loads, such as a
furnace or air conditioner, they have to be added to the load calculation.

As you can see, the 2,000-square-foot home in Table 2-1 needs at least (a
rounded-up-to) 80-amp service. Code requires at least a 100-amp service for
residences. Code also dictates the minimum number of circuits required to
serve the 2,000-square-foot load calculation. Using the code requirements
for circuit calculation for 2000 square feet at 3 VA per square foot requires a
minimum of four 15-amp 2-wire circuits or three 20-amp 2-wire circuits. Doing
the math for the 15-amp circuits: 2,000 × 3 = 6,000 VA ÷ 120 volts = 50 amps.
50 amps ÷ 15 = 31⁄3, so round up the result to 4 circuits. Doing the calculations
for the 20-amp circuits, the steps are: 6,000 VA ÷ 120 = 2.5; round up the result
to 3 circuits.
28
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Some electrical contractors do use the result of these calculations to wire
the home, and why not — it’s code. But it is also doing a job on the cheap.
Remember, the code is a minimum. We believe it is much better to have more
circuits than the required minimum. Some electrical inspectors say that you
can only have 11 receptacles on a 20-amp circuit and 8 on a 15-amp circuit.
But that confuses commercial requirements with residential requirements. For
commercial buildings whose load is unknown, the receptacle load is calculated
at 180 VA per receptacle. Residences have no limit to the number of recepta-
cles you can put on a circuit. You need only provide at least the calculated min-
imum number of circuits as explained earlier in this chapter.
For a 2000-square-foot home, code requires you to have
 Three or four general lighting circuits to supply lights and receptacles
 Two 20-amp circuits to serve the 3,000-VA kitchen receptacles
 One 20-amp circuit to supply the 1,500-VA laundry receptacle(s)
 One 20-amp circuit to supply the bathroom receptacle(s). (This circuit,
although required, doesn’t have to be included separately in the load
calculation.) This circuit can serve one or more receptacles; it can also
be used to serve more than one bathroom.
These minimum circuits are required by code. In Chapter 3, we talk about
why we recommend many more circuits than the required minimum.
Choosing a circuit panel
Manufacturers produce residential panels in various sizes, including 100-,
125-, 150-, and 200-amp versions. The 100- and 200-amp panels are the most
popular. It is usually cost-effective to choose a 200-amp panel, especially if
you envision a lot of electrical expansion in your home later. The 100-amp
panels have a maximum of 32 circuit-breaker spaces, and the 200-amp panels
have up to 40 spaces. These panels are equipped with a main circuit breaker;
if the panel’s main breaker turns off all the power in the residence, or if it’s
one of up to six such panels in a group that does it, it must be marked as a
service disconnect. If they’re sub-panels, a MAIN marking label is appropriate.
The electrical code limits the number of circuits in a panel to 42. Here we
mean a circuit is a space where a single pole breaker can be installed. For a
single-phase system, if more than 40 spaces are required, you must install
more panels. The largest three-phase panel has 42 circuit spaces. The code
also requires that all power be turned off with no more than six hand opera-
tions. Additionally, these disconnects are required to be grouped for one
occupancy. The electrical code doesn’t define an occupancy, which assumes
the word is commonly defined. We take occupancy to mean an independent
dwelling unit, such as a single-family house or an apartment.
29
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

Figure 2-2 shows a Square D 200-amp 40-circuit panel. Over the years, many
manufacturers and styles have come and gone, but Square D uses the same
breaker and panel style that they introduced many years ago. We like the con-
sistency of this company. A new Square D breaker made today will fit in
panels that were installed 40 years ago.
Very large houses commonly have panels in scattered locations. By code, the
disconnects for these remote panels must be grouped and marked as service
disconnects, and each disconnect must be marked for the location it serves.
At some accessible location inside or outside the home there must be one to
six marked service disconnects that turn off all the power to the home. The
main breakers in any remote panels shouldn’t be marked as service discon-
nects. They must be marked with information that states from what source
panel they’re fed.
Choosing a distribution-panel location
Your distribution panel should be somewhere both safe and convenient. It
should not be blocked by obstructions, not only because you need to access
it easily during installation and maintenance, but also because you may need
to access it quickly in an emergency.
Figure 2-2:

30
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Building codes make the following requirements for panel location:
 The area in which the panel is located must have at least 61⁄2' of head-
room. If the top of the panel exceeds 61⁄2', the clear working-space
requirement is extended to the top of the panel.
 There must be at least 30" of clear wall space from the floor to the ceil-
ing. (Don’t worry, the panel doesn’t have to be centered.)
 Pipes or ducts may not run above or below the panel.
 If something has to be run over the panel, it must be beyond the front of
the panel. To clarify: If a 4"-deep panel is mounted to the wall and a pipe
has to be run over the panel area, the pipe must be more than 4" away
from the wall and be higher than 61⁄2'. If necessary, you can install a false
ceiling so long as the required 61⁄2' of headroom is maintained.
 The floor space must be clear to 3' in front of the panel. The combina-
tion with the 30" above and the 61⁄2' height defines a clear working area
that is 30" wide by 3' deep by 61⁄2' tall.
 The area must be lit.
 The panel can’t be in a bathroom. Code defines a bathroom as an area
with a basin and one or more of the following: a toilet, a tub, or a
shower. You can’t install the panel in a clothes closet.
Normally, the panel’s main breaker serves as the service disconnect. If so, 
the conductors feeding the panel are service-entrance conductors. By code,
service-entrance conductors have to be terminated in the panel as near as
possible to their point of entry to the building. This usually dictates that the
panel be installed on an outside wall or on a stub or partition wall that con-
nects to an outside wall. Service-entrance conductors can be run on the sur-
face outside of a building to any necessary distance, and then brought into a
building and terminated in the panel.
The power company usually overfuses the service-entrance conductors. Their
fuse is sized to protect their transformer, not your service-entrance conduc-
tors. If your service-entrance conductors become shorted, they’re likely to
burn before the power company’s fuse blows. Code considers service-entrance
conductors to be outside of the building if they’re encased in 2" of concrete. In
a basement or on-slab construction, you can run the conductors below the
slab to a central location remote from the meter location.
Installing Electrical Services
Electrical service can be installed underground or overhead, both of which we
cover here. We believe the electrical service should be inconspicuous and not
detract from the aesthetics of the house exterior, which means we generally
31
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

favor underground service. The next few sections describe some considera-
tions for service installation, whether you’re setting up temporary service
during construction or permanent service for the residence.
Setting up temporary service
When you build a new house, the first electrical consideration is temporary
power. Temporary power can be overhead or underground. You and the power
company generally determine which. It’s not uncommon to have overhead ser-
vice for your temporary electricity and underground service for the permanent
installation. In some areas, the power company will supply and install the tem-
porary power for a fee. Their fees are usually quite reasonable.
Figure 2-3 shows a typical temporary electrical-service assembly. This partic-
ular one only has a few receptacles. On a busy site, we run a portable cord
from the main service panel to a freestanding panel that has a dozen or so
receptacles, as shown in Figure 2-4. The freestanding panel can be located
somewhere within the site.

32
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

When you add up the cost of a temporary service panel using new equipment,
the power company hook-up charges, and the permit fee, you are usually look-
ing at a cost of several hundred dollars. Consider these alternatives:
 If your project is in a site that has a next-door neighbor, buy power from
that neighbor. It would be unusual for you to use more than a couple of
dollars’ worth of electricity per month as you build the house.
 Check with an electrical contractor to see if rental equipment is available.
 Use a portable generator.
Looking up to overhead electrical service
The best overhead service is a mast service through the roof. In most cases,
mast-type service has a mast through the roof and a cable from the meter
socket into the panel. By code, the power-company connection to the house
must be below the service-entrance fitting. This code requirement often isn’t
enforced, but is very important to observe. When the mast goes through the
roof, this requirement is always met because the power company has no
choice but to connect to the mast below the service head. If the overhead
service doesn’t penetrate the roof, the power company often anchors the ser-
vice drop from the pole above the service head.

Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

The power company typically puts a drip loop in the conductors to prevent
rain from following the conductors to the meter socket. Unfortunately, the
insulated surface of the entrance cable acts like a hose, especially if the service
drop is anchored above the service head. Small voids in the stranded conduc-
tors allow water to run into the meter socket. Eventually this water can get
into the service panel, fouling the breakers and causing rust both in the circuit
breakers and the panel housing. When the power company installs your ser-
vice, try to ensure that they anchor the service drop below the service head.
Overhead service is usually either 100- or 200-amp service. An experienced
electrician requires about 7 hours of labor to install 100-amp service, and an
additional 3 hours for 200-amp service. If this is your first installation, don’t
feel bad if it takes you about twice as long to do the installation.
When installing the service, follow these general tips:
 Installing the conduit hub backward on top of the service panel moves
the conduit about 1⁄2" farther from the wall. This may reduce the amount
of drilling you have to do and generally makes the job easier.
 When using aluminum conductors, use #2 wire for 100-amp service or
4/0 for 200-amp service. For copper conductors, reduce the wire size by
one size. Aluminum is a lot cheaper than copper, but copper is a better
conductor.
 If your 200-amp service is connected to a mast, the mast will usually be a
2" conduit. You can use Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) or Intermediate Metal
Conduit (IMC) conduit. IMC is about 1⁄3 lighter than RMC, costs less, has a
thinner wall, a larger inside diameter, and a higher tensile (harder to
bend) strength. But RMC is made of mild steel, making it much easier to
thread with a hand-held pipe threader.
 You can connect 100-amp service to a mast conduit as small as 11⁄4",
although many contractors simply use 2" conduit for all masts.
 If your mast is 75' or more from the service pole, use at least 2" conduit.
If the pole is 150' away or more, use a 21⁄2" conduit. This prevents the
mast bending in high winds.
 Choose a meter socket that matches your service size (100- or 200-amp).
Most power companies no longer provide a meter socket, so you may
have to buy your own. Most power companies have a list of meter sock-
ets they find suitable. Make sure you heed any special height require-
ments from the power company for the meter socket.
Some wire assemblies, such as Sweetbriar assemblies, are Underground
Residential Distribution (URD) twisted-wire assemblies sized as 4/0-4/0-2/0.
This means that the power and ground conductors are 4/0 and the neutral
conductor is 2/0. The smaller neutral is justified because the neutral in a
34
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

120/240-volt or 120/208-volt system only carries the imbalance of the load
between the phase conductors. Any 240-volt load, such as an electric
range or dryer, contributes no current to the neutral conductor.
 Don’t use an outdoor disconnect if you can avoid it. Outdoor disconnects
are an inconvenience and possibly subject to vandalism. Sure, you can
lock an outdoor disconnect, but at some point the key will probably
get lost.
Figure 2-5 shows a typical overhead 200-amp electrical service. In this depic-
tion the service panel is in the basement. It could just as easily be installed in
the wall behind the meter socket.
If the service panel is installed on the wall behind the meter socket, stagger
the panel one stud cavity to either side of the meter socket. You usually have
no good way to come out of the back of the meter socket directly into the ser-
vice panel if both are mounted back to back.

Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

In Figure 2-5 you see the three conductors with about 2' of slack. The wire
slack allows the power company to connect to your service. The conductors
leave the conduit through a rainproof cap called a weather head or service-
entrance fitting, which clamps to the conduit and has insulated holes for the
conductors to pass through. The Neoprene roof flashing fits tightly to the
conduit and is cemented to the roofing. The flashing is slipped over the con-
duit before the weather head is installed. Below the meter socket, the 2"
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) conduit is glued to a 90° fitting called an LB. The L
stands for 90 degree and the B denotes the cover is on the back. You could
use LR, a 90° fitting with the cover on the right. The LL has the cover on the
left. Getting the heavy conductors in either of these fittings is impossible. The
2" PVC sweep is a factory-made 90° elbow.
In Figure 2-5, the tight-fitting hole through the roof sheeting holds the mast in
place. Code requires that a conduit be secured within 3' of a box or fitting.
For this reason you can only have 3' of mast projecting above the roof sur-
face. If the mast extends higher than that, you must secure it with a guy wire
(attached high on the mast and anchored to the roof).
Because the mast connects to the socket by a threaded hub, a support on the
wall is not required. However, some inspectors require an additional support
anyway. The conduit from the bottom of the socket to the panel is 2" PVC
conduit. Using service-entrance cable instead of PVC is less expensive and a
lot less labor intensive. If this is a traffic area or the cable could be otherwise
damaged, PVC is a better choice.
Going underground
Underground electrical service is the cleanest looking, because you don’t
have unsightly cables dangling between a utility pole and your house.
Installing it is easier, too. Unlike overhead electrical service, high winds, ice,
snow, and falling trees don’t affect underground service.
In most jurisdictions, the power company does the rest once these things are
completed:
 The underground meter socket (pedestal) is installed. (The meter socket
extends from about 18" below grade to about 5' above grade.)
 The conductors are connected from the meter socket to the panel and
inspected.
In addition, the power company usually also brings in the underground phone
and TV cable. If the utility company doesn’t install the underground service lat-
erals, you have to trench from the utility underground source to your socket
location and install your own laterals. (The electrical service lateral is the
buried wire that brings power from the utility’s transformer to your meter
socket.) The electrical code requires a depth of 18", but we recommend a
36
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

depth of 24" or more. In most cases the phone and cable companies supply
wire, but you have to install. In addition to the wires, you have to bury a cau-
tion tape 12" above the service lateral conductors. This tape is like what you
see all over the latest TV police dramas, except that it’s red and marked,
“Danger buried power lines.”
The electrical service conductors will be AWG 2 for 100-amp service or AWG
4/0 for 200-amp service. These lateral conductors must be approved for direct
burial, with markings on the wire indicating this approval. We recommend a
wire assembly called Sweetbriar, which is a 4/0-4/0-2/0 URD twisted three-wire
assembly. Sweetbriar assemblies are described in the previous section.
Mount the underground meter socket in accordance with power company
specifications. Underground meter socket mounting height can vary from 2'
to 6', depending on the utility company’s wishes. Figure 2-6 shows the layout
of a typical underground service installation. As you can see, the house looks
a lot nicer without an overhead cable and mast.
Not shown on the underground service detail are the service lateral conduc-
tors running 24" below the grade line. On this detail we’re using 4/0 service-
entrance style U cable (SEU). This cable requires a 11⁄2" 2-screw connector on
the back of the socket where the cable leaves. It also requires the same con-
nector where it enters the top of the panel. We point out in Figure 2-6 the
steps for making a recess behind the meter socket to accommodate the con-
nector and making a hole through the rim joist that fits the SEU cable. This
recess allows the panel to mount flush to the wall.
Connecting the electrical
distribution panel
After the overhead or underground service is in place, your next step is to
connect the service to your electrical-service disconnect. In most cases, the
main breaker in the distribution panel is actually the service disconnect. The
disconnect must have the neutral conductor connected to ground. This is the
only place where the neutral wire should be grounded.
 Power wires: The voltage across these two wires (usually black or red)
is 240 volts to supply large loads, such as a range or a clothes dryer.
The voltage between either of these power wires and the neutral wire is
120 volts.
 Neutral wire: Always white, this wire provides a return path for the 120-
volt loads that aren’t balanced across the loading of the two power wires.
 Ground wire: Either bare or green, this wire carries fault currents back
to the neutral in the panel and trips the breaker when a fault, or short, is
present. We cover grounding in more detail in the next section.
37
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

After the service disconnect, the system changes from a three-wire system to
a four-wire system: two power wires, a neutral, and a ground. Each of the four
wires serves a specific purpose:
If the service panel is mounted on a concrete wall, a backboard may be
installed to make panel installation easier. This backboard should be treated
plywood if there’s a chance that the wall could become damp. The branch
circuit wires (home runs) must be secured within 12" of the panel. In some
jurisdictions, you may be allowed to install a pair of 2" PVC conduits into the
ceiling space to accommodate the branch circuit wires.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

If the premises are to be equipped with a backup generator that powers the
whole house, the wiring from the meter socket must terminate in a service-
rated transfer switch, which then offers separate connections from back-up
power or normal power to the service panel. The transfer switch’s main
breaker becomes the service-entrance disconnect. From the transfer switch to
the main distribution panel, four wires must be run because now the neutral
and ground have to be separate conductors according to code. The distribu-
tion panel inside the house becomes a subpanel, and its main breaker can’t be
labeled as a service-entrance disconnect.
Grounding your service
The subject of electrical system grounding is the most confusing and misunder-
stood subject in electrical wiring. Here we explain a little about panel ground-
ing. We think it’s important, when explaining, to start at the transformer (like
the one shown in Figure 2-7) serving the house to get a complete picture.
39
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services
Residential voltages of the past
When electrical service was first installed to
residences in the United States, the service
usually supplied 100 volts. In the early 1900s,
220-volt service was introduced to serve large
power loads such as electric stoves and water
heaters. These systems retained 110-volt ser-
vice by center tapping a 220-volt transformer
and running three wires to the home, giving the
configuration you see in Figure 2-7. Other early
power systems supplied 115/230-volt or 117/235-
volt service. Many U.S. homes still only have
two-wire 120-volt service. Most of these were
installed prior to the 1950s.
A careful reader may notice that we use 110-
and 120-volt references interchangeably. Also,
when working with older appliances and equip-
ment, you may see markings that rate the
devices for older voltage systems. Fortunately, if
you need to connect a 110-volt appliance to 120
volts, or a 220-volt item to 240 volts, doing so is
perfectly safe.

The center tap on the transformer shown in Figure 2-7 is grounded at the 
service-entrance panel and is called the neutral. Just to make things confusing,
this neutral at this point is also the ground. As we mention earlier in this chap-
ter, this grounding of the neutral is only true at the service-disconnecting
equipment. In the wiring system beyond the service entrance, the wiring
changes to a four-wire system.
If the service disconnect is also the main panel breaker, the neutral (white
wire) from any light, receptacle, or appliance is connected to this neutral/
ground wire. All green or bare conductors from any of the circuits are
also connected to this neutral/ground connection point. Because so many
conductors must connect to the service-entrance neutral/ground, a connection
strip or bar with many terminals is usually used. You may even have multiple
bars connected by jumper wires to provide a sufficient number of connection

locations for the incoming neutral and ground wires. A filled 40-circuit panel
would have to accommodate a total of 80: 40 grounds and 40 neutral wires.
The neutral is a current-carrying conductor. The ground wire doesn’t carry
any current under normal conditions. The ground wire only carries fault
current if a grounded part comes in contact with an energized conductor.
Current flow on the ground will clear as soon as the circuit breaker trips.
When anything is required to be grounded, it has to be solidly connected to
the neutral/ground on the service disconnect. Electrical code requires this
point to be grounded by one of the allowable methods:
 If you have a municipal water system that uses metal piping (it seems
every municipal system in the U.S. does), you have to connect the
ground to the piping system if there is more than 10' of buried piping.
This is a good ground. Your grounding electrode conductor has to be
connected within 5' of where this piping enters the building. Continuity
of the grounding path cannot depend on water meters or filters, which
means you have to install jumpers around these removable items. The
4 AWG or 6 AWG jumper is connected to a ground pipe clamp on either
side of such items.
Connecting to water pipes does have one potential drawback. In a resi-
dential neighborhood, it connects you to your neighbors’ electrical ser-
vice if they’re connected to the same power company transformer. If a
neighbor experiences an open neutral condition, the water piping to
your house becomes that neighbor’s neutral. Of course, the opposite is
also true. Plumbers see sparks or get shocked when working on these
energized pipes. In northern climates when welders are used to thaw
frozen pipes, wiring connected to these pipes (like yours) can burn. If
the person sent to thaw the frozen pipes asks you to unplug the TV, you
may be in trouble.
 If you have a pump instead of city water, your piping from the pump to the
house is probably plastic. In this case, the electrical code allows you to
use an 8' ground rod that tests 25 ohms’ resistance or less for a ground.
Without the test you can just use two 8' ground rods driven 6' apart to
ground the service disconnect neutral. Electrical code also requires you
to use ground rods to augment the city water piping system.
If a pair of ground rods is your only connection to earth, you’re at risk
of being electrocuted during a lightning storm, a power-company trans-
former failure, or an accidental contact between your service drop and
the high voltage lines. In such an instance, anything connected to the ser-
vice ground — such as the piping in your house — can become energized.
Although these events are rare, you should be aware of the risk.
If your water is supplied by a well, you probably have 30' to several hundred
feet of well casing in contact with the earth. That is a good ground. If lighting
strikes, it could find the well casing via the wiring to the pump and burn the
41
Chapter 2: Bringing In the Services

pump motor and controls. If you have a good ground available on your site
(such as a metal well casing or any large amount of metal in direct contact
with the earth), use it. If connecting to a well casing, you should run an AWG
6 or larger bare wire to the well casing. Run this wire in the trench along with
the plastic water piping and pump power supply cables. The best way to
connect the ground wire to the casing is an exothermic weld. The next-best
connection is a terminal lug connected with a self-drilling/tapping screw.

 Understanding codes and standards for electrical installations

 Drilling joists and framing
 Running the wires
A
s you can tell by the title, this chapter is all about running the rough
wiring for your digital home. The rough wiring includes the wiring and
parts inside the walls that are eventually hidden behind drywall and plaster.
Rough wiring connects the electrical service entrance (see Chapter 2) to the
various switches and receptacles in your home. (The rough wiring also
includes specialized wiring for cable TVs, telephones, computer networks,
and sound systems, but we cover those subjects in more detail in later chap-
ters.) When your home is complete, you won’t see the rough wiring, but
you’ll appreciate the benefits of a high-quality wiring job every day.
If you’re going to tackle the wiring job yourself, this chapter guides you
through the process. If you plan to hire a contractor, you should understand
the rough-in wiring — know how it works and how it should be installed. This
chapter takes you through the planning and installation of rough-in wiring of
your home’s electrical system. For now, we focus on drilling home runs, care-
fully selecting locations for components, and mounting boxes and wiring.
Laying Out Receptacles (Legally)
Whether you’re building a new home or retrofitting an existing house, your
wiring job should start with the floor plan. Carefully consider how each room
in the home will be used. Where will appliances, lights, and desks be? The fol-
lowing sections guide you through the special considerations involved in
planning and installing receptacles. As always, special attention is paid to
code compliance to ensure that your home is safe and passes inspection.

Spacing receptacles
The National Electrical Code (NEC) requires that no spot along a wall be more
than 6' from a receptacle. For example, the first receptacle in any room must
be 6' or less from the door. The next receptacle on the wall must be 12' or less
from the first receptacle, and so on, continuing along the perimeter of the
room.
This spacing is often called the Six-Foot Rule. Some people take this literally
and place a receptacle every 6', which may be overkill in most rooms. To
eliminate confusion, we call it the Six- to Twelve-Foot Rule. Of course, code
dictates only minimum requirements; in most situations we recommend plac-
ing receptacles about 8' to 10' apart. Other code requirements include
 In any habitable room, any wall space that is 2' or longer must have a
receptacle.
 Rooms not designed for habitation — closets, pantries, and so forth —
aren’t required to have receptacles, but you may include some.
 Hallways 10' or longer are required to have a single receptacle.
 No spot along the wall above kitchen counters may be farther than 2'
from a receptacle. The maximum space between above-counter recepta-
cles is 4'. Any isolated counter space 12" or wider must have a recepta-
cle. A break in the counter space — such as a sink — counts as the start
of a new space. At least one receptacle must be within 2' of the sink.
 At least two circuits must be dedicated to supplying the kitchen and
dining room receptacles, and these receptacle circuits can’t supply any
lighting circuits or receptacles in other locations.
 Receptacles must be as evenly spaced as possible.
We recommend paying special attention to symmetry when installing recep-
tacles. For example, try to space outlets evenly on either side of a window.
Also consider special needs in every space, such as furniture placement. For
example, in Figure 3-1 a 2" × 6" framing extension was added to the normal
support framing; the quad receptacle box was moved 51⁄2" to the left to
accommodate future furniture placement. The loose Cat 5 network cables will
be stapled to the framing on the right later, before the wallboard is added.
The receptacle box is mounted by driving nails through the angled-edge
flanges and into the stud.
Underwriters Laboratory (UL) — the organization that tests and sets stan-
dards for electrical devices — requires that household appliances have cords
at least 6' long. An exception to this is kitchen appliances, which may have 2'
cords. Consider this limitation when spacing your outlets.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

When to use GFI receptacles
Ground Fault Interrupter (GFI) receptacles are also sometimes called Ground
Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets. A GFI is a safety receptacle that opens
the circuit if 5 milliamps (mA) or more of the current on the power conductor
is bleeding, or running, to ground and not traveling back on the neutral con-
ductor. The electronics in the GFI monitor the current on both the power and
neutral conductors for an equal load.
Milliamps is abbreviated as mA; 1 milliamp equals 1⁄1,000 of 1 amp.
If someone comes in contact with the power from a GFI receptacle, some cur-
rent may travel through his body to ground. If this current reaches 5 mA, the
GFI immediately trips and the power is cut off. Although 5 mA provides a pretty
hefty shock, it shouldn’t be fatal. The 5-mA level is used because a healthy
person can withstand a 10-mA shock for about 10 seconds and survive.
Some people believe that GFIs are solely for personal protection. Just because
a circuit is GFI protected doesn’t necessarily make it human safe. Some GFIs
have higher current ratings and are designed to protect heavy electrical
equipment. Be cautious: Always test GFIs before betting your life on them.
Figure 3-1:
Spacing is
an important
considera-
tion when

receptacles.
45
Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

GFI-protected receptacles are required in places with significant grounding
and shock hazards. You must use GFIs in the
 Kitchen: Above-counter receptacles in kitchens must be GFI protected.
The kitchen receptacles require their own circuit(s), and can have no
other outlets.
 Bathroom: Bathrooms are required to have a GFI within 36" of the
vanity. The bathroom receptacles must be GFI protected and require
their own circuit(s), and can have no other outlets outside the bath-
room. Figure 3-2 shows a GFI receptacle installed on the side of a vanity.
Note that this outlet is positioned so it won’t interfere with a large
mirror or medicine cabinet. The box was mounted at 38" measured from
the floor to the bottom of the box.
 Basement and exterior: All basement receptacles and exterior recepta-
cles must be GFI protected. Finished basement areas such as family
rooms do not require GFI protection for receptacles.
 Wet-bar sink: Here, the receptacles are installed for countertop use
within 6' of the outside edge of a wet-bar sink.
 Crawl space: Receptacles at or below grade level must be GFI protected.
 Garage, tool shed, storage area, and similar on- or below-grade struc-
tures not intended for habitation: An inaccessible receptacle, such as
for a garage door opener installed in the overhead, is exempt.
A change that was introduced in the 2002 code is that an appliance-garage
receptacle doesn’t count as a counter receptacle for spacing but can be con-
nected to the kitchen-required small-appliance circuit. An appliance garage is a
section of cabinetry built between the upper and lower kitchen cabinet to con-
ceal and park various appliances, such as a toaster or coffee maker, when not
in use. We generally install a quad receptacle inside the appliance garage. The
appliance garage has a roll-up door. The code requires you have at least two
circuits to supply the kitchen and dining room receptacle circuits. These cir-
cuits can’t supply other outlets in other locations, nor can they supply lighting.
46
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 
Silent C
Like most electrical trade professionals, we
prefer to drop the C from the GFCI acronym and
just call it GFI. Besides, one letter saves the
publisher some ink.

Figure 3-3 shows a sketch of an appliance garage. Although two duplex recep-
tacles are in the appliance garage, you must install a receptacle on both sides
of the appliance garage within 2', as shown. These receptacles must be GFI
protected.
Code lets you replace a two-prong receptacle with a GFI receptacle without
having a ground wire present. This allows you to plug in grounded (three-
prong) plugs. Installing a GFI receptacle to get a third prong doesn’t give you
a grounded receptacle. You only have a grounded receptacle if a continuous
wire runs from the receptacle ground screw terminal to the ground bar in the
service panel. If this connection isn’t present, using a surge-protected outlet-
strip at a receptacle without the ground wire doesn’t give you surge protec-
tion. In this case you should install surge protection at the service panel to
protect the whole house.
Figure 3-4 shows a panel surge protector next to a double Decora switch for
size comparison. This surge protector costs about $50.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Setting box heights
Once you’ve figured out where you want to install receptacles, the next step
is to decide how high you want to mount the boxes. Traditionally, outlets are
placed relatively low, where they are less visible, but sometimes you may
want to mount them a bit higher.
The electrical code doesn’t specify a height for receptacle boxes, except to
say that they have to be less than 51⁄2' above the finished floor. Receptacles
above kitchen counter tops may be no more than 20" above the counter top.
This requirement is a change in the 2002 code. Earlier codes set the above-
counter distance at 18". The earlier 18" requirement didn’t allow for the
installation of multi-outlet strips installed on the bottoms of upper cabinets.
Wiremold makes a product perfect for this use. Its outlet assembly — shown
in Figure 3-5 — is similar to a computer power strip, but it lacks a cord.
Wiremold strips are available in a variety of sizes and outlet spacings.
In older houses that had to be retrofitted for electricity, the receptacles were
usually cut into the baseboards. The baseboards of these older homes were
frequently solid wood between 6" and 10" tall. The 3⁄4"–thick baseboards pro-
vided a rock-solid mounting point for receptacle boxes. In later homes that
were wired during construction, outlets were usually placed about 12" above
the floor. If your project has existing receptacles, you may want to match the
height of the existing receptacles. If there aren’t too many existing recepta-
cles, you may want to abandon or ignore them and chose a different mount-
ing height. A height of 12" is typical but not mandatory.

Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

Figure 3-6 shows a new receptacle cut into a wall at a higher level than the
baseboard receptacles, which were installed in 1920. If the baseboards are
painted, the original receptacle could be removed and the hole simply patched.
But the room in Figure 3-5 is quarter-sawn oak paneling from floor to ceiling,
and a patch would have been less appealing than simply leaving the outlet in
place.
Switch boxes are usually mounted at about 4' above the floor. Thermostat
boxes can be mounted at 5'. For commercial wiring, the American Disabilities
Act (ADA) requires that receptacles be mounted at least 18" above the floor,
and switches must be mounted so handles are no higher than 48". You don’t
have to meet these requirements in your own home. The electrical code
requires that switches and circuit breakers used as switches be located so
you can operate them from an accessible location: Install them so the switch
handle is 6' 7" or less from the floor.
Most of the figures in this book show the receptacle boxes mounted 16" high,
and switches and kitchen-counter receptacle boxes mounted 48" high. These
measurements are from the rough flooring to the bottom of the electrical box.
For an 8' ceiling, some drywall installers prefer that switches be mounted at a
distance of 485⁄8" between the ceiling and the top of the box, so that they only
have to cut the lower sheet of drywall when the 4' × 8' or 4' × 12' sheets are
hung horizontally.

Making sure the box is flush
When you mount a receptacle in a switch box, the electrical code requires
that each box extend out through the building’s wall finish to within 1⁄4" of
being flush with the drywall surface. The box should be set exactly even with,
or back slightly from, the finished surface to ensure that the finish plate sits
flat on the wall. Before applying the drywall or other finish, check each box
with a straight edge and a level to ensure that they are, uh, straight and level.
If the stud is slightly twisted or angled, the box may stick out from the dry-
wall even if the measurement at the point of attachment is correct. Dealing
with these kinds of problems is easier if you do so before hanging the dry-
wall. Watch for this when checking your boxes, and adjust their mounting as
necessary.
Mounting boxes during rewiring projects
Installing boxes as part of a rewiring project can be a little tricky, because
there’s usually wall finish in the way. This means you have to spend some
extra time finding the hidden wall studs, and then carefully cutting holes in
the finish so the new boxes can be mounted.
We recommend that you cut the openings so that one side of the box is 1⁄2"
or less away from the stud. This way the box can be mounted directly to the
framing using drywall screws through the side of the box. Cutting slightly
away from the stud makes the box angle in slightly, helping make it flush with
the wall surface. This is especially helpful if the stud is angled slightly, which
is a common problem.
To install a box in an existing finished wall, follow these steps:
1. Locate the stud using a stud finder, and then approximate and mark
its center.
2. Mark the top and bottom of the box on the wall, using the actual box
as a template.
3. Drill a pilot hole about 2" away from the stud center.
You know the drill: Wear eye protection before you start and make sure
you’re very careful while using power tools.
4. Use a reciprocating saw to slowly cut along the top line of the box
toward the stud.
Hold the reciprocating saw with the blade tip angled toward the stud.
Use a 14-teeth-per-inch blade to ensure a clean cut. When the cut is near
the stud, you should be able to feel the stud — first turn the saw off, and
then angle the blade toward the stud.
51
Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

5. Once you locate the stud, saw within 1⁄4" of it.
6. For the bottom of the box, repeat steps 3 through 5.
7. Use the box as a template again to draw the complete box cutout on
the wall.
8. Drill a 1⁄4" hole at the side away from the stud.
9. Make the vertical cut for the far end of the box away from the stud.
It is especially important in lath-plaster walls to make the far vertical cut
first. If you cut the vertical on the stud side first, the lath will flap with
the motions of the saw blade and make it very difficult to cut.
10. Make the vertical cut on the stud side and remove the loose wall piece.
You’ll probably also have to drill a hole here to begin the saw cut.
The finished hole should be 1⁄16" larger than the box. If you need to install a
second box such as a cable TV or phone wall jack, it is easy to do that in the
same opening between the two studs, on the opposite stud.
Depending on the type of finish used on the wall, you may need to take extra
care to avoid damaging the finish. This is especially true when you’re cutting
into a finish that you won’t retouch, such as paneling or tile. Different types
of finish call for different precautions:
 Paneling: Make a 1⁄8"-deep cut with a utility knife on the horizontal plane,
across the grain. This keeps the paneling from chipping as you saw. Saw
on the inside of the knife cut.
 Tile: Cover the area beyond the cut with duct tape, using the tape as the
cutting guide. Keep the saw shoe firmly against the tile surface.
 Painted plaster: Hold the shoe slightly away from the surface to prevent
marring the paint. Don’t use tape for protection on painted plaster walls
because the paint will come off with the tape.
Old-work boxes have flanges on the front to fasten to wall surfaces. We think
they’re okay for phone or TV cable wiring, but we don’t recommend them for
switches or electrical receptacles. A box fastened to the framing is a far supe-
rior mounting method, and can stand the greater force of plugging in cords.
Stud-mounted boxes are also easier to trim to the wall.
In Figure 3-7, the three-gang switch box and the central vacuum outlet were
mounted to the stud on the right. For the receptacle, a 2 × 4 was screwed to
the door framing to provide a secure mounting some distance away for that
box to clear the 4" wide trim. On this second-floor installation, the wires were
fished down the wall from the attic.

Calculating box fill
As you plan and install the boxes that hold your home’s switches and recep-
tacles, you need to calculate box fill, the space in cubic inches that devices
and wires need inside the box. Receptacle and switch boxes come in various
sizes, so make sure you choose boxes big enough to hold everything you
plan to stuff inside.
Count the number of wires that will be in the box:
 Each insulated wire counts as one wire equivalent.
 All bare wires (ground wires) added together count as one wire equiva-
lent, whether there are 1 or 100 ground wires.
 Each device (switch or receptacle) counts as two wire equivalents.
Table 3-1 lists the number of cubic inches filled by common wire sizes
used in home wiring. You can see by the table that a wire equivalent
for 14 AWG wire is 2 cubic inches while a wire equivalent for 6 AWG is
5 cubic inches. The larger the wire size you are using, the larger the
required box.

6 AWG

For example, assume you have a box that contains a 14/2 cable with ground,
as well as a 14/3 cable with ground. (14/2 means the cable contains two insu-
lated 14 AWG conductors; 14/3 means the cable has three insulated conduc-
tors.) This gives a total of five insulated conductors, two bare grounds, and
one receptacle. All the bare grounds count as one wire. The receptacle
counts as two wires. Each insulated conductor counts as one wire equivalent.
5 Insulated Conductors + 1 Ground Wire + 2 Receptacles = 8
Wire Equivalents
This example box is filled with eight wire equivalents. Multiply the wire
equivalents by the cubic inch capacity required for 14 AWG wire:
8 × 2 cubic inches = 16 cubic inches
For this example, you need to use a box that has a minimum volume of 16
cubic inches. When in doubt, err on the side of providing a little extra space.
Drilling Holes for Wiring
When you’ve decided where and how high to mount your switch and recepta-
cle boxes, it’s time to drill some wiring holes.
Drilling the framing
We recommend running your wires about 4" above where you plan to mount
your receptacle boxes. This means that if you plan to install your receptacle
boxes 16" above the floor, add 4" for the box, plus the 4"-space above the
box; you should drill the holes 24" above the floor.
54
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

While you’re at it, follow these guidelines when drilling your holes:
 Make sure that all of your wire holes are drilled at the same height.
Measure them if necessary. Also take care to avoid drilling at an angle;
the straighter the holes, the easier it is to pull the wires through. Drill
each hole so the distance from the front of the stud is the same on
every stud.
 Run all wires at right angles to or parallel to framing. Don’t run wires at
angles between wall studs, floor framing, or ceiling framing, and don’t
drill angled holes. Most often you’re running wiring at right angles to the
framing members to get to a wall cavity some distance away. Once you
reach a wall cavity where a box is needed, then you make a 90° angle
within that stud to reach the box.
 Drill to fit the stud.
• In a 2" × 4" wall stud, drill wire holes in the center of the 4" face of
the stud.
• In a 2" × 6" wall stud, the hole must be at least 11⁄4" back from the
wall face.
 The hole size depends on how many wires you intend to run in the hole,
including electric, phone, cable, and special communication systems. In
Chapters 7 and 9 we discuss which wires shouldn’t run parallel to power
wires, but in general you should avoid running computer network and
amplifier-input cables right next to power wires. If the hole will need to
accommodate a single three-wire cable, use a 3⁄4" drill bit.
The electrical code requires the wire be supported within 12" of where
the wire enters the box. By giving 4" of clearance between the wire run
and the box, you have enough room to staple the wire to the wall stud
just above the box.
 When installing wire runs under tall windows, drill through the studs
below the window rough in, or go up and over the window framing. For
windows that go very low to the floor or for doors, you have no choice
but to go up and over the frame.
Be diligent about drilling holes in the center of 2" × 4" studs, and at least 11⁄4"
back on wider studs. This lessens the chance of a drywall nail or screw punc-
turing a wire and causing a short in the circuit. On specialty walls such as
those using 2" × 2" studs or 3⁄4" stripping on foundation walls, use steel plates
to protect the wires if you can’t meet the 11⁄4" setback. These plates are com-
monly known as nail plates. A standard nail plate is 11⁄2" × 3" 14-gauge steel
plate. Plumbers also use nail plates to protect copper and plastic piping from
damage by drywall mounting nails.
55
Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

Drilling joists
In homes with basements, most of the wiring home runs are run in holes
drilled in the floor joists. Home runs are the supply wires that travel from the
first load on the circuit back to the electrical panel. If your home doesn’t
have a basement, all of the home runs come out of the top of the panel and
run along the top of the lower cord of the roof trusses. In multi-story build-
ings, the joists between floors are drilled to provide home runs.
When drilling joists, follow these basic rules:
 Drill holes large enough to easily accommodate all the wires you need to
pull through, while also drilling as few holes as possible to avoid weak-
ening the joists.
 As with holes drilled in wall studs, holes in joists should be in a straight
line.
 In 2" × x" lumber floor joists, leave 2" from the bottom of the drilled hole
to the lower edge of the joist.
 In manufactured joists, follow the manufacturer’s drilling specifications.
Manufactured joists usually have 11⁄2" to 31⁄2" flanges on the top and
bottom, attached to a web of 3⁄8" oriented strand board (OSB) ranging
from 10" to 20" high. Most manufacturers allow a 11⁄2" hole anywhere on
the web, and a 2" hole no closer than 12" to the end support. Larger
holes must be farther away from the weight-bearing end of the joist.
While drilling down through a floor supported by manufactured joists,
don’t drill through manufactured joist flanges.
Your electrical inspector probably won’t worry too much about holes
drilled in manufactured trusses, but your framing inspector will.
 In both lumber and manufactured joists, drill the holes low for wires
crossing the joist, and run the wires high, 1" or so from the floor for the
wires running parallel along the joists. This keeps the wires away from
any additional holes you may have to drill later.
 If the joists are open frame, no need to drill. Staple the wires to the top
of the bottom cord of the joists on the cross-joist runs and to either side
on parallel runs.
Some electrical inspectors will lower, or derate, the rated capacity of grouped
conductors. This is because grouped conductors heat each other up, making
them unable to carry their rated current without overheating. After 10 or 20
years of overheating, the insulation can become brittle and break off if the
conductor is bent. The National Electrical Code requires electrical conduc-
tors that are grouped together to be derated to a lower amperage capacity.
56
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Table B. 310.11 of the 2002 code lists derating factors based on wire capacity
and grouping. In reality, heating is seldom a problem because most loads are
transient, meaning that not all conductors in a bundled group will carry their
full loads at the same time. Using the code 50-percent table for load diversity
and having fewer than 40 conductors, you can have 15 amps on a 14 AWG
conductor and 18 amps on a 12 AWG wire. Still, keep this in mind when plan-
ning your wire runs. Avoid grouping conductors that carry heavy or continu-
ous loads.
57
Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring
Running wires for rewiring
For rewiring, the receptacle wires should go
from box to box, just as in new construction. We
covered rewiring box mounting in the
“Mounting boxes during rewiring” section.
Once the box opening is cut, you still have to get
wires to it before mounting the box. For homes
that have a crawl space or basement, locate the
stud cavity that you cut into for a box and then
drill a hole up through the flooring and the wall-
framing bottom plate. You have to be quite exact
here. If you miss, you’ll drill a hole up through
the finished floor and ruin it, whether the floor
is carpeted, tiled, or hardwood.
To validate your measurement for partition
walls, try our method:
1. Using a wire coat hanger in place of a drill
bit, drill a hole from upstairs to locate the
place in the basement to drill up.
The makeshift drill bit is an 8"- or 10"-long
piece of the straight part of a wire clothes
hanger. This 3⁄16" wire drills a hole surpris-
ingly well, and because a wire hanger is
smooth, it won’t catch carpet threads and
cause a run. When drilling through hard-
wood flooring, we pull the quarter-round
molding slightly away from the baseboard
and drill between it and the baseboard so
we don’t leave a little hole in the floor.
2. Remove the drill motor and leave the
hanger protruding 6" so you can easily
locate the wire marker in the basement.
3. Calculate the distance from your marker. If
you drilled the hole straight, measure the
distance from the marker to the stud cavity
center and drill up from the basement.
4. Run the wires and mount the boxes.
When drilling to wire a box on the inside of an
exterior wall on an old construction, you usually
have to drill through an 8 × 8 timber at an angle
to wind up in the wall cavity. If you drill at too
low an angle, you’ll drill through the siding. If
you drill at too steep an angle, you’ll drill through
the floor. All we can say is review your
trigonometry and measure twice, drill once.
If you have no access from below, the wires
have to be fished down from the attic or upper
crawl space. You can still use the wire hanger to
locate the stud cavity. Here the hanger has to
be long enough to be seen through the insula-
tion. The hole you make in the ceiling can be
patched with a drop of plaster or spackling
compound.
Rather than run wires from box to box, some
electricians install a powered junction in an
accessible area and then branch out to each
receptacle. This layout resembles a star or a
spoked wheel. This method saves a little wire,
but it seems messy.

Pulling Wires
So you’ve mounted your switch and receptacle boxes, you’ve planned your
wire runs, and you’ve drilled all of your holes. But you look at your progress
thus far and think, “Something’s missing. . . .”
Wires! Yes, it’s time to pull some wires through the holes that you carefully
drilled in your studs and joists. Running wires is a big job, but it can be
accomplished by following these basic steps:
1. Pull the conductors from box to box.
As you pull the wires, you might have to mark some of them. The best
way to mark wires is to simply write on the wire jacket with a ballpoint
pen or permanent marker. Remember that the first 8" or so of sheathing
is going to be removed. You remove 3' or 4' of the protective sheathing at
the panel. Some electricians ring cut the cable’s protective sheathing and
slip it off, and then slip it back over the black (or red) conductor after
rough in to retain the previous marking. You don’t need to identify the
grounds because they ultimately all connect together. Neutrals also
usually don’t need to be identified, except in the case of AFI and GFI
circuits at the panel.
2. Cut the wires at each box.
Cut the wires so there’s at least 6" — and preferably 8" — of free conduc-
tor extending from the face of each box.
3. After pulling a single room, go back and strip each conductor’s outer
sheathing.
Code requires that the protective sheathing surrounding the insulation
on the conductors extend 1⁄4" into the box. This prevents chaffing
between the box and the sheath from harming the conductor insulation.
4. Insert the wires into the boxes.
5. Secure the wires, with one staple, directly above each box.
The staple must be within 12" of the box.
6. If you haven’t already, mark each wire’s use.
You may have to mark some of the wires again if you marked them ear-
lier. Marking isn’t necessary for just the power in and power out at most
receptacles. Marking is useful for a feed through GFI or some of the
switching.
58
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Don’t try to save wire as you run it. Code requires at least 6" of slack. If you
wind up with a foot of slack rather than 6" to 8", that’s okay. A little extra
length allows you to easily install the wires onto the receptacles a few inches
away from freshly painted walls. You can easily push the slack back into the
box after connecting the receptacle. Of course, you can only do this if the box
has sufficient volume, which is covered in the earlier section, “Calculating
box fill.”
Figure 3-8 shows a roughed-in box. Notice that the slack in one of the wire
sets is about 8", and the other wire has about 12" of slack. The wires running
to the switch box (not shown) have to run over the right side because the
box is as deep as the stud and the wire has no room to run behind the box.
Wiring to Code
It should go without saying that the National Electrical Code (NEC) has a few
things to say about how a home should and shouldn’t be wired. It’s impossible
for us to tell you every single code requirement here, so spend time studying
Figure 3-8:
Leaving a lot

easier.
59
Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

the actual code to make sure you do the job right. Remember, the NEC isn’t
just a bunch of arbitrary requirements designed to make your life more diffi-
cult as an installer; the guidelines are designed to make your house as safe as
possible. We recommend using the Handbook of the NEC Codebook. It has the
complete code text in addition to explanatory notes and diagrams.
In this section, we highlight a few specific requirements to keep in mind as
you rough in your wires. Earlier sections in this chapter detail code require-
ments for locating and installing switch and receptacle boxes. Other wiring
requirements include:
 Bedrooms: Arc Fault Interrupter (AFI) circuits are only required on bed-
room circuits. An AFI is a circuit breaker that monitors the current; it rec-
ognizes the characteristics of an electric arc and trips when it detects
one. Brush motors like those found in vacuums, mixers, or drills produce
an arc when running. Sometimes false tripping can occur if using these
types of devices on AFI breaker-controlled circuits. We recommend that
the bedroom hall receptacle(s) be supplied by non-AFI circuits to power
vacuum cleaners for cleaning the bedrooms if false tripping occurs.
 Smoke detectors: If a smoke detector is installed in a bedroom, it must
be on an AFI circuit. Of course, smoke detectors must also have battery
backup power as well. The electrical code doesn’t specify where smoke
detectors should be placed, but building codes usually require them in
all bedrooms and bedroom hallways. Consider using one or more combi-
nation carbon monoxide-smoke detectors. Make sure the interconnect
feature works with your smoke detectors.
Smoke detector systems are required to have an interconnect feature. If
one detects smoke, all interconnected detectors sound an alarm. The
interconnect wire is usually orange, which should be connected to the
red conductor on a three-conductor cable.
 Bathroom, laundry, kitchen, or dining-room receptacle circuits: All of
these circuits must be supplied by 12 AWG wire. This is also true of any
receptacle circuit that will have more than a 12-amp load. Lighting cir-
cuits in these locations can be wired with 14 AWG wire.
 GFI wiring: When pulling the wires, the power wires at a box can usually
be marked with the letter P — except when the wiring connects a GFI
receptacle to a second receptacle. On a GFI feed-through system, the
power-in wire connects to the line terminal, and the power-out wire con-
nects to the load terminals on the GFI receptacle. It is important to iden-
tify the in-out wires at rough in so the GFI is connected properly.
 Existing wiring: The electrical code doesn’t mandate that you bring an
existing residence up to code. It only requires that any new work you
do conforms. However, the existing wiring in your home isn’t immune
60
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

from scrutiny. If an electrical inspector finds something she considers
hazardous, she may instruct you to correct the problem. Such problems
may include bare wires, open splices, or extension cords used for per-
manent wiring. If you refuse to solve these problems, the inspector can
order the power company to disconnect your power.
 Existing receptacles: If you plan to replace a receptacle in a kitchen,
bathroom, garage, or other location where a GFI outlet is required, you
must replace the outlet with a GFI unit. This is true even if the old recep-
tacle was installed before GFI outlets were required. If the house uses
older two-wire conductors, mark the new GFI receptacle with No ground
is present. You can feed other three-prong receptacles from this
ungrounded two-wire circuit. They will be ground-fault protected, but
mark them with No ground is present; GFCI protected.
Diagramming
Diagrams are a crucial part of your wiring plan. You may draw up the dia-
grams yourself, or a contractor, electrician, or designer may provide them. In
any case, it’s important that you know how to read and use wiring diagrams.
Figure 3-9 shows a few of the common symbols used on electrical diagrams
and blueprints — for a more complete listing, see Color Plate 6 in the color
insert pages in this book.
Figure 3-10 shows a basic wiring diagram for a bedroom with nine recepta-
cles. The receptacles are indicated by the standard receptacle symbol, which
looks like a circle with two legs. The home run, which goes to the panel, con-
nects to the receptacle behind the door. This wall is long enough that the
receptacle is mounted beyond the door swing, meaning you can see it when
the door is open. On a shorter wall, the door may hide this outlet, making it
essentially useless. But as stated earlier in this chapter, any wall longer than
2' in a habitable room must have an outlet by code.

Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

The wiring from the home-run receptacle goes up and over the doorway
during rough in to connect to the other receptacles in the room. Each recep-
tacle is connected to the next in turn. The wire run ends at the receptacle on
the left side of the bedroom door.
As you run the wires, mark your progress on your diagram or blueprint. After
you make a few runs, draw lines from point to point on your diagram to
remind you what’s done and what isn’t. Include in your markings the kind of
wire you used. We use this system:
 Cross the line at a right angle with a long line for a power wire.
 Cross the line about half the length for a neutral (white) wire. For
instance, two longs and a short indicate the connecting wire is a three-
conductor wire.
 Don’t mark for the ground. For simplification it is convention to omit
grounds in diagramming for wiring, understanding that ground wires
must be present.
This helps make sure the circuits are complete. On your documents, feel free
to get as elaborate or colorful as you want.

Some diagrams may look simple even though they involve rather complex
wiring. Figure 3-11 is typical of what you may see on an electrical blueprint
for lighting. Some electricians wire these lights just the way they’re shown,
but this is a mistake. This consumes a lot of time. This type of diagram is
intended to simply convey which switches control which fixtures.

tion. This diagram shows wiring both for lighting and smoke detectors. Note

 The wires marked as 14-3 are 14-3 Romex. This is a 14-gauge, three-
conductor wire. The 14-3s serve three functions:
• Those to the paddle fans are switch legs. The black brings power
to the light, the red powers the fan from the wall-mounted speed
control, and the white is a common neutral for both fan and light.
• Those between smoke detectors power the detectors on the black
and white, and the red enables the interconnect feature.
• Those between the three-way switches are the three-way intercon-
nects. The red and white are the travelers, and the black is the
common. (See Chapter 4 for more about three-way switches.)

Wiring the rest of the house
The previous sections focused on two bedrooms. Now you will look at the
remainder of this house. The home of interest is a 2,000-square-foot home.
For an experienced electrician this will require about 140 hours to rough in
and 55 hours to trim it out.
Turn to the color insert pages in this book and check out Color Plate 8 to see a
whole-house wiring diagram. A circuit number labels each fixture or receptacle
and some switches, indicating which circuit breaker controls this circuit. The
switches that don’t have a circuit number don’t have a power wire — mostly
three- and four-way switches. This circuit numbering is what a designer would
typically include on a blueprint. The electrician would bring the home run
to where it is indicated and then run a wire in the easiest or shortest route
from that point to all of the boxes with the same number. In many cases the
electrician may change the indicated home-run box if he discovers a better
alternative.
The living room of this house has three floor receptacles. Floor receptacles
require a special box and cover, which come in different styles for carpet, tile,
and wood floors.
Wiring dryers and ranges
Wiring standards for ranges and dryers have changed in recent years. During
World War II, they dropped to three circuits in an effort to conserve copper.
The third conductor — the white or bare wire, depending on the type of
cable used — served as both a ground and a neutral. In any other wiring
system this arrangement is prohibited. Although there were never any prob-
lems with this wiring method, folks stuck on technicalities wanted the stan-
dard changed back to four wires, and in 1999 they got their way. Now any
new residential construction requires a four-wire feeder to a range or dryer
and a four-prong receptacle for each.
If you’re replacing the service panel on a three-wire configuration, the local
authority may require you to update three-wire power plugs to four-wire
plugs. Any new installation of a 240-volt circuit — whether the home is exist-
ing or new construction — must use a four-wire configuration. The plugs in
question are
 A 40-amp circuit — usually for an electric range — requires 8-3 Romex
with a ground.
 A 30-amp circuit — usually for an electric dryer — requires 10-3 Romex
with a ground.
 These 30-amp and 50-amp 240-volt receptacles require two-gang boxes
for four-prong receptacles.
65
Chapter 3: Roughing In the Wiring

Figure 3-13 shows a three-prong plug for an electric range. This picture was
taken through the range’s bottom drawer opening. This opening is typically
7" high and 19" wide. Notice that the receptacle is to the right of center to
help it clear the cable going into the stove-junction box. Notice that the box
needs to be mounted 3–4" from the floor to allow the cord to be easily
plugged in. The install for a four-prong, 50-amp cord is better if the box is
mounted so the receptacle can be mounted horizontally.
Figure 3-14 shows a modern range connected to a three-wire pigtail. In this
photo the ground (neutral) is disconnected to reveal the strap that connects
the ground to the stove body. This connector strap must be in place with a
three-wire connection. In a four-wire connection the bonding strap must be
disconnected. If in doubt, have an electrician help with the installation.
Rather than cutting or removing this strap, we suggest you just disconnect it
from the neutral terminal and leave it attached to the ground screw. If this
range is ever reinstalled on a three-wire system it may prompt an installer to
reconnect it properly.
Wiring closets
The electrical code has special rules about clearance on closet lights. A
major concern with closet lights is that an item on a shelf may tip against an
exposed lamp and cause a fire. To light a narrow closet, we recommend
installing a florescent strip fixture above the closet door. We recommend a 4'-
long fixture because the 48" bulbs are usually cheaper than 24" or 36" bulbs.
Figure 3-13:

240-volt

range.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

A florescent fixture must have at least 6" of clearance from a storage area,
while an incandescent light must have 12" of clearance. For a walk-in closet, a
center ceiling fixture with 12" of clearance from the shelf is permitted and is
probably a better choice.
The closet lighting can be fed from the nearest receptacle. We recommend
placing the switch outside the closet and controlling it with a pilot switch like
the one shown in the color insert pages in this book as Color Plate 1. Don’t
confuse a pilot switch with a lighted switch. The handle is lighted on a pilot
switch when the light is turned on. The handle of a lighted switch is lighted
when the light is turned off. The installation for this type requires that you
have a neutral in the switch box to provide the return path for the pilot light.

T
hroughout this book, we show you all the ins and outs of a digital home’s
advanced electrical systems. Most of the wires, junction boxes, breaker
panels, and other parts are vital yet ugly, so they remain hidden. When
people actually use the electrical system, they mainly flip the system’s
switches and plug items into the receptacles.
This chapter is about your electrical system’s public face: the switches and
power receptacles you use every day. We start by helping you pick components
that complement your home’s décor. Then we show you how to properly install
those components so they’re safe and ready to use. Selecting and installing
switches and receptacles is often called the trim-out phase of construction,
because these parts are an integral part of your home’s cosmetic trim.
Selecting Device Styles and Colors
Your first step as you trim out your home’s electrical system is to choose the
color and style of your visible devices. These visible devices include switches,
receptacles, and sensors. The least expensive choices are, of course, the old
standby toggle-type light switch and the ubiquitous standard oval duplex
receptacle. It’s hard to go wrong with the same parts that are found in zillions
of homes around the country.

You may, however, want to spruce up your home with more decorative
switches and receptacles. Many are now available in the decorator style of
design, which features rectangular receptacles and paddle switches rather
than toggle switches. Decorator components usually cost about twice as
much as standard components.
Color Plate 2 (turn to the color insert pages in this book) shows receptacles
and switches from the Decora collection by Leviton. Most ground fault inter-
rupt (GFI) receptacles are decorator design. We think decorator-style compo-
nents are a better choice than the old standby styles. Paddle-style switches
are easy to operate even when your hands are full, and many dimmer
switches are only made in decorator style.
In addition to standard and decorator devices, many more expensive spe-
cialty devices are available. One style features a snap-on cover requiring no
screws. Spend some time at your local electrical supplier to see what wiring
devices are available.
After choosing a style for the switches and receptacles, you should choose 
a color. The standard colors are brown, white, ivory, and almond. Almond
seems to be the most popular color right now, followed closely by white and
ivory. Ten years ago, ivory was predominant. Many more colors are available,
but it may be hard to find special devices in a specific color. For instance, a
specific dimmer, fan-speed control, or volume control may be offered in only
one of the standard colors.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 
Pre-marking pays off
When wires are marked in an understandable
way, connecting them properly to switches and
receptacles is easy and even fun. As we
describe in Chapter 3, things can get messy
when you are installing wiring, but the job will
be easier if you spend some time before you
start running the wires taking careful notes and
labeling every single wire. Don’t fear being
redundant.
The time you spend organizing, marking, and
understanding everything during the rough-in
phase will save you a lot of time during the trim-
out phase. After the drywall and finish are in
place, whatever is behind them can quickly
become a mystery. Unraveling that mystery can
take a lot of time and create headaches, unless
you’re working with good notes and clear
markings.

Most people choose one color and use it throughout the home, but this con-
vention isn’t written in stone. For example, almond-colored components
might look great in the kitchen and living room, but almond might be too pale
against the paint in the dining room. For certain rooms, you may want to cus-
tomize the switches and receptacles by painting them or by covering them
with contact paper or wall paper.
Working with Receptacles and Switches
In this section, we describe installing the actual device you’ve chosen in the
previous section. We go through the various connection details with diagrams
and photos. We supply some time estimates to give you some idea of how
much time this phase of your project will consume.
Installing receptacles and GFIs
Installing duplex receptacles should be a breeze. Most jurisdictions have no
standard for how duplex receptacles should be installed, but in some juris-
dictions, the inspectors require the receptacle to be installed with the ground
terminal up; see Figure 4-2, later in this chapter. The logic is that if a piece of
metal falls on the outlet between the receptacle and a plug, it can bridge
across the hot and neutral contacts if the outlet is installed ground down. We
think this is nonsense. One manufacturer offers a four-outlet receptacle with
one outlet ground up, one ground down, and two horizontal opposite to each
other. Most 15-amp and 20-amp angled cord ends have the cord hang prop-
erly if the receptacle is installed ground down. We also believe that standard
receptacles look better with the ground installed down.
Figure 4-1 shows a Bryant quad receptacle. This is an Underwriters
Laboratory-listed wiring device. As you can see, a receptacle is oriented with
the ground terminal up, down, right, and left: You have four mounting
options. This wiring device mounts on a 4" × 4" box. With the adapter to the
right of the quad receptacle, it can be mounted on one of the following:
 Single-gang box: Designed for a single standard receptacle or switch
 Two-gang box: Designed to hold two standard receptacles or switches
Because of the multiple receptacle orientations, this receptacle can accom-
modate several plug-in adapters and still leave receptacles free.
71
Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

All 30-amp and 50-amp angle cord ends hang properly when the receptacle 
is installed ground up. The 125-volt, 15-amp, and 20-amp cord ends may be
manufactured with ground-up or ground-down orientation. For permanently
installed appliances such as washers and gas dryers, you have to check your
appliance’s cord orientation. The great majority of 15-amp and 20-amp cord
plugs are oriented properly if the receptacle is installed with the ground ter-
minal down. The receptacles for these appliances should be installed about
40" measured to the top of the box. At this height the appliance hides the
receptacle and the receptacle is high enough to be reached.
Figure 4-2 is a photo of a 50-amp and a 15-amp receptacle installed with the
ground terminals oriented up. You can see the 50-amp cord is hanging prop-
erly and the 15 amp cord isn’t. The 15-amp receptacle should have been
installed with the ground terminal oriented down to make the installation
look better. A careful look at the 50-amp receptacle reveals the manufac-
turer’s engraved name upside down. The point is to get you to think of the
total picture and get the installation correct the first time; consider what
comes next.
An industrious, experienced electrician with a screw gun can install up to 30
receptacles in an hour. A novice or first-timer who can install five receptacles
in an hour is doing pretty well, because experience and skill greatly affect
labor time. If you can install 15 receptacles per hour, it takes about 5 hours 
to trim out a 2,000-square-foot home. The trim-out time includes installing
switches, receptacles, TV and phone jacks, lights, trimming the electrical
panel, and making final connections to mechanical systems such as a furnace
and air conditioner.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

If the outlets were roughed in properly (by properly we mean that enough
slack is present and the conductors are plainly marked so that the trim out 
is just a simple repetitive exercise for each one; see Chapter 3), installing a
receptacle is a simple matter of following these steps:
1. Connect the two white conductors in each box to the neutral termi-
nals on the receptacle.
The neutral terminals usually have white or silver screws.
Most receptacles have two sets of wires roughed into the receptacle
box, because power receptacles are usually daisy chained together. One
set of conductors brings in power from the previous outlet in the chain,
and the other set sends the power on to the next receptacle.
2. Connect the two black conductors to the power terminals on the
receptacle.
The power terminals usually have darker or brass screws.

Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

3. Wrap one of the green (or bare) wires around the receptacle’s ground
terminal screw.
When you wrap the ground wire around the ground terminal, wrap it so
a tail about 3" long sticks out.
4. Connect the other green wire to the ground wire’s tail using a yellow
wire nut.
Wrap the wire so that when you tighten the screw, it draws the wire
tighter, rather than pushing the wire out from under the screw.
Wrapping both ground wires around the ground terminal’s screw is
against code. Alternatively, you can connect the two green (or bare)
ground wires along with a pigtail (a short piece of green or bare wire)
and wire nut, and then connect the single pigtail wire to the ground ter-
minal on the receptacle. Whatever method you choose, make sure the
ground wires are connected solidly through to the next box.
5. Cut the blue wire! Cut the blue wire!!
Just kidding. There shouldn’t be a blue wire, but if there is, don’t cut it.
If you install a GFI receptacle with only one power and one neutral wire,
simply connect the power-supply wire to the line terminals on the receptacle.
If the GFI receptacle is protecting downstream standard receptacles, the
wires feeding the standard receptacles must be connected to the GFI outlet’s
load-side terminals. These downstream load wires should be marked during
rough in. A daisy-chain electrical circuit is said to be directional. Power flows
from a power source to outlet 1, 2, and so on. In a 15-outlet chain, outlet 15 is
downstream of outlet 14. Outlets 2 through 15 are downstream of outlet 1.
When standard outlets are properly connected downstream of the load termi-
nals of a GFI-protected outlet, the downstream outlets are also GFI protected
and are labeled as such.
The simple way to mark downstream load wires is to strip both the white and
black wires 3⁄4" during rough in. Connect these load wires to the GFI before
stripping the line (power) wires to avoid getting them mixed up. Alternatively,
you may want to mark the line and load wires with mailing labels.
The electrical inspector is probably going to use a tester like the one shown
in Figure 4-3 to make sure the GFIs and receptacles are connected properly.
Two GFI receptacles appear nearby in the figure. The face-down receptacle
shows yellow tape with a warning from the manufacturer prompting you to
connect the device properly.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

Installing switches
The first time you install a switch and everything works properly when you
try it, a smile will probably appear across your face. Connecting every wire in
a four-gang switch box to the correct terminal when nothing is marked can be
a challenge for any electrician. Don’t do that to yourself. When you rough in
the switch boxes, install and connect every wire that you can. Visualize the
plaster in place and imagine the passage of time between rough in and trim
out. This can be a month or more, so connecting what can be connected and
marking wires will save you a lot of headaches later.
Make some wiring rules and keep to them consistently. For example, in most
wiring scenarios, the power wire should go on top, but on a single-pole (On-
Off) switch, it makes no difference. Additional rules that we suggest are in
Table 4-1. The next few sections describe how to install the most common
types of switches used in your home.

In the 2002 code, most lights or fixtures are called luminaires. Luminaires are
described as fully completed light units. A porcelain lamp holder, for exam-
ple, is not a luminaire until you screw in the light bulb.
Single-pole switches
Single-pole switches are the easiest to install. This assumes, of course, that
you understand that a neutral wire goes to the light fixture and completes the
circuit. Not counting the ground wire, you must connect only two wires, and
it doesn’t matter which goes where. One wire is the power source and the
other brings power to the light. When you turn on the switch, both wires are
energized.
A single-pole switch wiring has two wiring options. The circuit wires (hot 
and neutral) can be brought into the light-fixture box or to the switch box.
Generally, bringing the circuit into the switch box is easier. This is especially
true for multiple-gang switch boxes and multiple light fixtures controlled by
the same switch.
Three-way switches
Suppose you want to control a single light fixture from both ends of a hallway.
You can do this by installing three-way switches at each end of the hallway.
Three-way switch wiring has five popular wiring layout options, three of
which we will consider here.
76
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

The circuit for a three-way switch normally requires four wires:
 Black: Power
 White: Neutral or, sometimes, traveler
 Green or bare: Ground
 Red: Traveler
Three-way switches are technically single-pole double-throw switches, or
double-on with no off position.
Figure 4-4 shows the wiring diagram for a three-way switch circuit. The
ground (green or bare) wire is omitted both in the text and the diagram for
clarity. Bear in mind the ground wires are always connected together and
connected to all wiring device ground terminals.
To wire the three-way circuit shown in Figure 4-4, follow these steps:
1. Install a two-conductor cable (14-2 Romex with ground) between the
light fixture and the first three-way switch.
This switch is called switch number 1 in Figure 4-4.

Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

2. Install three-conductor cable (14-3 Romex with ground) from the first
three-way switch to the second three-way switch in the circuit.
This switch is called switch number 2 in Figure 4-4.
3. Connect the red and white wires to the brass screws on each three-
way switch assembly, as shown in Figure 4-4.
• In the second three-way switch, you’ve connected the red and
white travelers to the traveler terminal screws. You have one wire
left to connect (the black wire) and one terminal left to connect it
to (the common terminal).
• In the first three-way switch, you’ve connected the travelers to the
two traveler terminal screws.
The brass terminal screws are called the traveler terminals and the
common terminal screw is usually dark brown on a three-way switch. In
any case, two screws are colored the same (travelers) and one is colored
different (common).
4. On the remaining switch terminal (common), connect either one of
the wires of the two-conductor cable from the light.
The remaining wire of this two-conductor cable connects to the black of
the three-conductor from the second three-way switch.
On this switch wiring setup, you have a two-conductor cable bringing
power into the light-fixture box, in addition to the two-conductor cable
from the three-way switch.
5. At the fixture box, connect the white power wire (neutral) to the fix-
ture’s white (neutral).
6. Connect, with a wire connector, the black power wire to the white
wire that runs to the first three-way switch.
7. Connect the one remaining wire (black) to the fixture’s black wire.
This is the black of the cable that runs to the first three-way switch.
In the preceding steps, you used the white wires as travelers and to bring
power from the fixture to the first three-way switch. Whenever you use a
white wire as a power wire (not a neutral), mark it with colored electrical
tape — any color but green — or color it with a permanent marker — again,
any color but green.
Keep in mind the common terminal on a three-way switch is always connected
within the switch to one or the other traveler terminals. From the common termi-
nal in the figure, you see an arrow close (not connected) to a traveler terminal.
78
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

This shows the common flips from one traveler to the other traveler when the
switch is operated. In one position it connects to one of the traveler terminals
and operates the switch, and the common is connected to the other traveler. We
describe this switch elsewhere as a double on.
If reading the following paragraph doesn’t turn on the light (pardon the pun),
draw this diagram on paper and follow the text. Picture power connected to
one of the three-way switch commons. The three-way switch connects this
power to one of the travelers. If the other three-way switch is connected to
the same traveler that connects to the light, the circuit is complete and the
light comes on. If the opposite switch is moved to its alternate position, the
light goes out.
The travelers are like two roads going to the same place. Moving the three-
way switches is analogous to events. In the spring you can’t take the lower
(red) road because the bridge washed out. In the winter you can’t take the
high (white) road because an avalanche took out the road. The light is on
when a continuous path goes from the power wire through the switches, 
then through the lamp back to the neutral.
 The three-way switch diagram in Figure 4-4 shows both commons on the
three-way switches connecting the commons to the whites. You can see
that if one of the three-way switches is operated, there’s no longer a cir-
cuit. Now one of the commons will be connected to the red. Further, you
can see the circuit to the light fixture can be restored by operating either
switch. You can also see that the circuit still behaves the same by con-
necting the travelers on the opposite switch common terminals. It doesn’t
matter which traveler color connects to which screw, it still works the
same.
In some wiring schemes the switch box may have a red wire bringing
power up to the light. In these cases, you have to distinguish this red
power wire from the red traveler wire. Just stripping the red power wire
back 3⁄4" should be sufficient, or you can mark the switch-leg red wire
with black tape. If you do neither, remember the red traveler will be run-
ning with the white traveler (part of the same Romex) from the other
switch.
 The second wiring layout for three-way switches, shown in Figure 4-5,
brings the electrical circuit to the first three-way switch. The power neu-
tral would connect to the white wire going to the fixture box. In the fix-
ture box, the power neutral connects to the lamp neutral. The black
circuit wire connects to the black of the three conductor to the second
three-way switch. Everything else is the same.
79
Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

 The third variation, shown in Figure 4-6, brings power to the second
three-way switch in a very different way than the previous two layouts.
In this scheme, the traveler wires are going to be black and red, so you
can use the white wire as neutral. We seldom use this layout, but it’s
nice when the first three-way switch and the fixture are far from the
second three-way switch, and the first three-way switch’s area has 
no power.
As briefly mentioned earlier, other wiring schemes bring the three-conductor
wires though the fixture box(es). We never use these messy and complicated
wiring layouts. The numerous connections waste time and increase the possi-
bility of errors. A wiring problem usually involves removing a light fixture or
paddle fan to solve the problem.
There is a three-way wiring layout that connects power to the travelers. The
power to the loads is taken from the three-way commons. This system works,
but as the different three-way switches are turned on, the load’s neutral and
hot wires are swapped. That is, in one position, one conductor is neutral; in
the next position, the same wire is hot. Don’t use this switching arrangement!
It is a code violation. Before four-conductor cable was readily available, this
wiring was often used to have power for a receptacle and three-way switching
at a remote location by just running three-wire cable.

Four-way switches
After you understand how three-way switches work, wiring four-way switches
is a piece of cake. Three-way switches allow you to control light from two
locations. Four-way switches are used to control lights from three or more
locations.
Four-way switches have four terminals and are always used in conjunction
with and in between (electrically) two three-way switches. You can install any
number of four-way switches in a circuit between the two three-way switches.
Four-way switches come in two types:
 Through wired: This is the most common. The pair of travelers from
one three-way switch connect to one end of a four-way switch, and then
the pair of travelers connected to the other end of the four-way switch
run to the next switch in the circuit (whether it’s a three- or four-way
switch).
 Cross wired: On a cross-wired four-way switch, one three-way switch’s
traveler pair goes on one side of the four-way switch, and the travelers
from the other three-or four-way switch connect to the other side.
Although the travelers are red and white just like connections on a
three-way switch, the colors are less important than the proper pairing.

Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

Figure 4-7 shows a four-way switch wiring layout. The wiring schematic is 
the same whether through wired or cross wired — you just have to identify
which switch type you have to properly connect it. The manufacturer usually
helps by marking one traveler pair one color and the other pair another
color. To reiterate, our terminology here of a pair is the red and white (trav-
elers) from one location. In the explanation we consider a four-way switch
connected between two three-way switches.
The three-conductor cable from the first three-way switch goes to the four-
way switch location. From there, a second three-conductor cable goes to the
second three-way switch location. A quick mental drill: If you connect the two
three-conductor cables together, color to color, in this four-way box, you have
the three-way wiring working. In a sense, all a four-way wiring and switch
does is connect the travelers in to the travelers out. With the four-way switch
in one position the connection is color to color. In the other position the
colors are reversed. In the four-way box, the black wire in connects to the
black wire out — not to the switch at all. The four-way switch in one position
connects the red traveler in to the red traveler out and the white in to the
white out. In the alternative position, it connects the red traveler in to the
white traveler out and the white traveler in to the red traveler out.
Pilot switches
Pilot switches have a pilot light built into the switch, illuminating when the
load (a light or fan, for example) is turned on. They can be used on single-
pole, three-way and four-way switching arrangements.

Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

 A single-pole pilot switch outside a closet can remind you to turn off the
closet light.
 An entry-porch switch may control exterior lights, and a pilot switch
reminds you when the exterior lights are on.
 A pilot switch can control the lights in a basement, crawl space, or attic.
 You may also want to install a pilot switch for equipment that normally
doesn’t give a visual clue when it’s on, such as heat tape.
The single-pole pilot switch is just like a standard single-pole switch, except
that now it matters where the power and load (light) wires are connected.
The wiring scheme for both single-pole and three-way systems requires a
neutral at the pilot switch location. The three-way pilot wiring requires the
pilot neutral be connected to the power neutral wire for that circuit. A three-
way pilot switch can only be used on one of the two three-way locations. In
both instances, when you bring a neutral to the switch box, you also bring
the power wire to that box.
Lighted switches
Lighted switches illuminate when the light (load) is turned off and are avail-
able in single-pole, three-way, and four-way configurations. A lighted switch
doesn’t require a neutral. Lighted switches can be installed on any single-pole
switch, three-way switch arrangement, or four-way switch wiring scheme.
You don’t have to use lighted switches at every switch location in three-way
and four-way schemes.
Lighted switches are most useful in areas that are normally dark. For exam-
ple, an interior bathroom or hallway may be dimly lit even in the middle of a
sunny day, which makes a lighted switch helpful. Lighted switches let you
find the switch in the dark. Install these lighted switches anywhere that find-
ing a switch in the dark is a problem. On a three-way or four-way wiring
scheme with all lighted switches installed in all locations, all switches illumi-
nate when the light is turned off.
Dimmer switches
You can install dimmer switches on any incandescent lighting system. Most
dimmers change the incoming AC voltage to DC and then vary the value of
the DC voltage. For this reason, you shouldn’t connect a dimmer to a recepta-
cle. If you plug a device such a cell phone charger into a dimmer-controlled
receptacle, it could burn out the dimmer and may damage the charger.
Dimmers can be used to vary the speed of AC-DC brush motors like those 
in electric drills and fans. Generally, however, you should reserve dimmer
switches solely for use with incandescent lights.
83
Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

Dimmers are generally available for 600- to 2000-watt applications. If you
want to control a fixture with a dozen 60-watt lamps, a standard 600-watt
dimmer won’t suffice. Always use a dimmer rated for larger wattage than you
need. This reduces heat in the switch, making the dimmer last longer. Higher-
wattage dimmers have cooling fins, which you can usually remove to fit the
dimmer into a multiple-gang switch arrangement. Of course, removing a fin
reduces the dimmer’s wattage capacity. If you’re going to dim a lot of watts,
wire to a single-gang location.
Dimmers are made in single-pole, three-way, four-way, and multiple-switch
versions. Some of these have full-range dimming in all locations. Special dim-
mers can dim low-voltage and fluorescent lighting. To dim fluorescent light-
ing, the fixture must have a dimming ballast that matches the dimmer. Some
of the specialty dimmers are very sensitive to lightning, which of course is
just another reason to install surge protection at your home’s service panel.
Timer switches
Timer switches come in various types. These switches are generally a single-
pole Decora design and fit in a one-gang switch box.
Check the load and type rating to make sure the timer is adequate for your
application. For example, some timer switches are for incandescent loads
only, while others will control lights or motors.
Some common uses for specific timer switch types include
 Interval: Turns on a load for a specific time interval. Commonly used to
control a heat lamp or fan.
 Time delay: Can have delays ranging from two minutes to an hour.
Turns on instantly, but delays turning off after you move the switch to
the off position.
 Variable countdown: Usually just a rotary knob that you can set for
times from a few minutes to many hours. You’ve probably seen these in
motel bathrooms to control the heat lamp.
 Programmable: Can be set on intervals within a 24-hour cycle. Although
it has indoor uses such as office lighting and fans, it’s most often used
for outdoor lighting.
If you want outdoor lights to come on at dusk, we recommend installing a
photo sensor along with the timer. For example, suppose you want the lights
to come on at dusk and turn off at midnight, and then turn back on at 6:00 AM
and stay on until dawn. Set a programmable timer to turn on at 6:00 AM and
turn off at midnight. When used with a photo sensor, the lights are only on
during the dark times between 6:00 AM and midnight.

Infrared sensors
Infrared sensors, occupancy sensors, and motion sensors are all different names
for the same device. These sensors act like switches that turn on when you
or your pet squirrel walks into the sensor’s field of detection. The sensors
most often control incandescent or fluorescent lighting, and some are rated
to control motors. These devices add convenience and should save power,
especially in areas where lights tend to be left on unnecessarily. Some motion
sensors have ambient light sensors and don’t turn on if the area is already
lighted from windows or a skylight.
Many fixtures have built-in motion and light sensors. Some also have built-in
overrides that allow you to turn on the light whether motion is detected or not.
X10 devices
X10 devices are remote-controlled devices that work using a line carrier
signal sent through your home’s existing wiring. (See Chapter 5 for more
about X10 devices; see Chapter 13 for computer control of X10 devices.) An
X10 transmitter can be a wired-in switch, a plug-in unit, or a hand-held trans-
mitter. The transmitter must be powered, but it doesn’t need to be wired
directly to a receiver in the traditional sense. The transmitter sends control
signals to receivers over the existing house wiring, meaning that one trans-
mitter can control almost any light or device in your home. The transmitter
can even be a hand-held universal remote control like the one you use for
your TV. Likewise, a programmable garage-door opener can be programmed
to turn on driveway lights. Both the receiver and transmitter must use the
same side, or leg, of the home’s breaker panel. If not on the same panel leg, a
signal bridge is sometimes needed.
A variety of programmable X10 controllers and timers are available. They can
control lights, alarms, lawn sprinklers, and many other devices. Because X10
devices use existing wiring, you can use them in new construction as well as
in retrofit installations. A single receiver such as a single-pole switch can cost
about $20, and a transmitter can be double that amount.
Flushing and Leveling Electrical Devices
As you’re installing switches and receptacles in your digital home, you want to
make sure that each device is flush (seats properly) and level (straight), making
it look like the professional installation that it is. Although even an experienced
builder may not identify trim that’s not quite level or flush, the human eye per-
ceives the problems and feels a little uncomfortable in the room.
Flushing and leveling start during the rough-in phase of construction. During
rough in, make sure that every box is level and doesn’t protrude past the sur-
face of the drywall. Sometimes the drywall hanger can knock the box out of
85
Chapter 4: Trimming Your Home’s Electrical System

level. The screws that mount switches and receptacles in the boxes are slot-
ted, allowing for a small degree of leveling adjustment. For single- and two-
gang installs, these slots can facilitate a lot of adjustment. For three-gang or
larger boxes, the degree of adjustment is limited. In all cases, tighten the
screws until the plaster ears on each switch or receptacle exert a slight
amount of pressure on the finished wall surface.
On a four-gang switch box, for example, the switches all have to line up with
screw holes in the trim plate. Moving the switches into alignment when the
screws are too tight is tough, and they needn’t be excessively tight. With the
plate in place and all screws started but not tightened, check the leveling of the
trim plate. At this point, you can still level the plate by putting the edge of your
screwdriver against the edge of the plate and bumping it with the palm of your
hand. Be careful not to damage the finished surface. Once leveled, finish tight-
ening the screws. Don’t make them too tight; plastic trim plates break easily.
No matter how hard you try, after installing the drywall you may notice that
some box edges protrude from the wall. Don’t fret! Try this remedy:
1. Insert a narrow screwdriver near the top of the box between the box
and the drywall, and then locate the nail securing the box to the stud.
2. With the end of the screwdriver against the nail, hit the screwdriver
with a hammer and drive the nail back slightly.
3. Repeat this on the bottom nail, moving each nail until the box is flush.
If the box breaks loose from the nail, use a few drywall screws through
the side of the box to refasten it to the wall stud.
If you use plastic boxes in accordance with article 314.43 of the 2002 electri-
cal code, you must cover any screw heads inside the box with some insulat-
ing material or tape. This prevents the conductors from contacting the
screws. You can also cut the entire side from a broken box and slide it
between the screw heads and wires to satisfy the code requirement.
On a multiple-gang box that is protruding slightly, a hold-it can be used. A
hold-it is a piece of sheet metal shaped like the letter F. You insert this piece
of metal between the outside edge of the box and the drywall with the
longest side up. Installing it long-side up prevents it from falling into the wall
cavity if the pressure on the sheet metal is less than the pull of gravity. The
box is pushed back slightly more than flush and the two tabs of the hold-it
are folded into the box, thus holding the box flush.
By code, the maximum allowable gap between a box edge and plaster, dry-
wall, or plasterboard is 1⁄8". If you find the gap too large for your trim plates to
cover, check your local supplier for oversized trim plates. The oversized trim
plates also help cover drywall goofs.

Testing Your Installations
After all the switches and receptacles are installed, everything must be
tested. Obviously, check all the lights to make sure they work. Check all of
three-way and four-way switch locations to make sure they work as intended.
Use a receptacle tester that has a GFI trip tester to determine whether the
wiring was done properly. At this point, you should be ready for a perfect
final inspection.
Although the receptacle test is referred to as a polarity test, AC voltage has no
polarity. The test checks the connection of the hot conductor in relation to
the receptacle’s neutral and ground terminals and indicates whether a neu-
tral or ground is open (disconnected or broken). If the hot is open, the test
indicates nothing — the lights on the tester won’t light up.
Figure 4-8 shows a receptacle tester. This particular tester also checks GFI
receptacles, which is a feature you should look for. The GFI tester duplicates
the function of the test button on the GFI receptacle. Perform this test not
only on GFI outlets, but any receptacle that feeds through the GFI. The GFI
test won’t work if the ground wire path is open.

Controlling Your Life Remotely
In This Chapter
 Understanding remote controls
 Using X10, RF, IR, and UPB to control power to lights and devices
 Timing appliances and saving energy
F
ifty years ago, remote controls were almost unheard of. But as years
passed, handheld remotes started controlling various devices. The
Zenith Space Command introduced many people to TV remotes, using sound
waves to change the channel or adjust volume from across the living room.
Remotes used low-power radios to open or close garage doors. Later, TV and
home electronics remotes used infrared (IR) light waves to provide remote
control.
Remote controls aren’t just for garage door openers and VCRs anymore. You
can control your entire home using remote control systems. Imagine being
able to turn on any light or adjust the temperature without moving from your
chair. This chapter introduces some of the remote control technologies avail-
able for your digital home. It also shows you some of the handy automation
features that help make your home safer, more energy efficient, and easier to
live in.
Controlling Your Gadgets Remotely
Remote controls don’t have to be just for home electronics or specific appli-
ances. If an item in your home is powered by electricity, it can probably be
controlled remotely. For instance, in addition to describing IR and radio fre-
quency remotes, the following sections explain motion sensors, which can
turn on lights or security cameras. The technology called X10, which we also
explain here, can control lights and other devices.

Infrared and radio frequency remotes
You probably already have a lot of remote controls in your home, such as hand-
held IR remote controls for TVs, VCRs, stereos, CD players, and DVD players.
You may also have manufacturer-provided IR remote controls for ceiling fans,
gas fireplaces, window blinds, air conditioners, and heaters. Other remotes —
such as garage door openers — use radio frequencies (RF) to provide control.
The remote shown in Figure 5-1 controls a ceiling fan, and although it provides
remote control, it’s actually hard-wired to the fan assembly.
If you encounter poor signal reception between a handheld IR remote and its
receiver, you can install a repeater. Repeaters act like mirrors that let you see
around corners, allowing the IR wave to reflect around corners.
RF remotes work through low-density walls, but may not penetrate concrete.
The transmitter’s strength determines its operating range. Most handheld RF
remotes work to a distance of about 100'.
Motion sensors
One of the most commonly used lighting controls is the misnamed motion
sensor. These devices, which actually detect body heat, are often used with
Figure 5-1:
This
manufac-
turer-
supplied

controls a

90
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

outdoor lighting, but a variety of motion switches designed for indoor use are
available. These indoor motion sensors are useful in areas where
 You tend to leave lights on.
 Manually turning lights on or off is inconvenient.
Motion sensors directly replace standard single-pole switches. Many motion
sensors can work without a neutral wire present in the switch box. They gener-
ally have a 180-degree sensing field of view that covers an area about 20' × 20'.
Most motion sensors also have automatic ambient light sensors built-in, mean-
ing that if the area is lit with sufficient natural light, the sensor will not turn
the lights on. Most sensors include a manual override so they can work like a
standard toggle switch when needed.
X10 remotes and devices
Wouldn’t it be cool to turn on the kitchen light from your bed so you don’t
trip when you get up for your 3 a.m. drink of water? If you think this kind of
control is only possible if you can train your dog to flip light switches with
his nose, think again. A technology called X10 allows you to control any
device in your home using your existing electrical system. With X10 you can
turn on the lawn sprinkler or the sauna stove, dim the lights, and change the
TV channel, all with the same handheld remote control. You can also pro-
gram X10 devices to act automatically. For example, you can set the central
vacuum system to automatically turn off when the doorbell or the phone
rings. Some X10 controllers have an “all lights on or off” feature. Many X10
devices can be programmed using computer software.
As we describe in Chapter 4, residential electrical systems in the United
States use 60-cycle alternating current (AC). This means that the voltage
cycles through zero 60 times per second. When the voltage is at zero, X10
devices use the wires to transmit control commands from controllers to
receivers in your lights and receptacles. The X10 system uses 16 numbered
addresses (1 through 16) and the first 16 letters (A through P) of the alpha-
bet. This gives the system its capacity of 256 addresses (16 × 16). Each
address can control an unlimited number of devices.
You may encounter a few X10 technology limitations:
 Poor signal reliability: You may find that commands are successfully
transmitted only about 90 percent of the time, depending on where you
are in your home.
91
Chapter 5: Controlling Your Life Remotely

 Time delays: You may encounter a half-second delay between pushing
the On button and seeing the light come on.
 Cross talk with neighbors: With only 256 X10 addresses available, your
neighbor’s X10 may inadvertently control your lights.
 Line noise: Electrical line noise may degrade X10 signal strength.
Amplifiers and line couplers are available to help address this problem.
 No feedback: When you operate an X10 device remotely and out of sight
or hearing, you don’t get any feedback that lets you know whether your
command was successfully received. There are now some controllers on
the market that have feedback features.
Selecting X10 devices
You may use X10–controlled relays, switches, receptacles, dimmers, or plug-
in modules to actually provide control. Once the controlling devices are
wired or plugged in, you just have to choose how to control them. You need
two basic components:
 Transmitter: The transmitter sends your control input to the receiver. It
can be wired, or it can use IR or RF signals to transmit commands to a
plugged-in receiver/transmitter.
 Receiver: The receiver is connected to your electrical system. It
receives control signals from the X10 transmitter and initiates some
action. This could be turning on or off a load or dimming a light, for
example.
Figure 5-2 shows an inexpensive handheld X10 RF remote and receiver/trans-
mitter (transceiver). The transceiver is shown straight on and from the back.
The key-chain RF transmitter can be set to control two X10 addresses. This
unit receives an RF signal and transmits an X10 signal. The right-side view
shows the plug-in and the unit’s receptacle. This RF handheld remote sends
on or off signals to the X10 transceiver. The transceiver plugs into an outlet
and sends an X10 signal over the house wiring to control anything you have
set to its address. It also turns on or off its own built-in receptacle.
Figure 5-3 shows seven assorted X10 devices, each of which is numbered.
These devices each have some unique features:
 Device 1: This transmitter just plugs into a standard receptacle. The
transmitter has 16 buttons and 16 letter positions, allowing control of
256 X10 addresses.
92
Part I: Installing Power Distribution and Basic Wiring 

 Device 2: These three-way switches can replace a standard single-pole
or three-way switch. Once you install a switch, just set the switch and a
transmitter to one of the 256 available addresses.
 Device 3: This fixture module is designed to mount in a box . This
module has dimming capabilities.
 Device 4: This appliance module plugs into a receptacle, and then you
plug an appliance or lamp into the module. Set the address code on the
front of the module and control it with any X10 transmitter set to the
same code.
 Device 5: An X10 signal controls relay operation for this plug-in relay
module. We have used these to enable remote opening of garage doors
that did not come equipped with remote openers. For garage door open-
ing and closing on commercial garage doors that have separate buttons
for up and down, the installation requires two relays. Relays can also be
set for momentary operation. In the momentary operation mode, the
relay closes when it receives an on signal and then immediately turns
off. This mimics a person pushing a doorbell or a garage door opener,
and then releasing it.

Chapter 5: Controlling Your Life Remotely

Retrofitting X10 in older homes
New homes aren’t the only places where X10 can be used. These devices can
be easily used in any home that has AC electricity.
Color Plate 3 (shown in the color insert pages in this book) shows an exam-
ple of an older home upgraded with X10 devices. In the figure, you can see a
wall fixture that was installed about 90 years ago — it’s the light fixture on
the right side, just above the globe. This is one of three similar fixtures in a
library finished with quarter-sawn oak paneling and beams. Each of the two
lamps on the light fixtures was originally controlled by a separate pull chain.
Lighting all three wall fixtures required walking around the room and pulling
all six chains. By simply removing the fixtures and installing a fixture module
connected to the existing wiring, X10 gives full on, off, and dimming control
of these three fixtures from one location.

The paddle fan in the same room (see Color Plate 3) has two X10 controls
installed in the fan’s hanger box. One control dims the light or turns it on and
off. The second control is wired to turn the paddle fan on and off. We
installed a four-button wall transmitter to control the fan, the fan’s light, and
the three light fixtures along the wall. X10 allowed us to update the electrical
controls without damaging the beautiful and expensive oak paneling.
Controlling X10 away from home
Once you have X10 controls in place, you can add a phone interface to con-
trol any X10 device from any touchtone phone, including cordless and cell
phones.
One such interface is called TeleMaster, which costs about $150. This unit
simply plugs in to an existing phone jack and a 120V outlet. With this
TeleMaster interface, you can call home as you return from vacation or work.
Press a couple of phone buttons on the phone to turn on the air conditioner
and warm the hot tub. Access to the TeleMaster is restricted by a four-digit
security code. Normal phone calling to and from your home is unchanged.
You can set up this interface so that when the phone rings, lamps in your
home flash on and off, thereby giving a visual indication to someone with a
hearing impairment.
The only real drawback to a system like the TeleMaster is that it doesn’t pro-
vide any feedback. For example, if you use it to turn on the hot tub, how do
you know that it really turned on before you step in? Without any kind of
feedback, you don’t. Still, this is definitely a great way to add high-tech
remote control to your digital home.
95
Chapter 5: Controlling Your Life Remotely
Beyond X10
Due to the limitations of X10 devices, a California
company called Powerline Control Systems
(PCS) has developed a new product using a new
proprietary power-line communication technol-
ogy, the Universal Powerline Bus (UPB). This
system has a total of 62,500 addresses, which
should eliminate the problem of cross talk. The
reliability of UPB is said to be near 100 percent.
The devices themselves have some programma-
ble features. They can be used on X10 systems
without interfering with X10 operations. The UPB
system doesn’t have as many devices or inter-
faces available as does X10, but the list is grow-
ing. At the time of this writing, UPB devices cost
more than similar X10 devices, but that too may
change.

Using Timers for Around-the-Clock
Control
Timers are a great way to add convenience and save money. A thermostat set
to change the temperature in your home at certain times (for example, to lower
the thermostat to 65° after 10:00 p.m. and to raise it back up to 72° at 7:00 a.m.)
can save money on your utility bill for heating and cooling. When using timers
to heat or cool a large area, you may need to add some recovery time to the
time settings, so that the desired temperature is reached at the right time.
Adding a timer to turn off the water heater overnight can also save money.
Be aware that big changes in temperature may involve an hour or two recov-
ery time, depending on the outside temperature. If you are heading out to
your secluded mountain cabin, we suggest making the call earlier than usual.
You can also add programmable timers to control repetitive tasks — for
example, to set the outdoor lighting to come on at 6:00 p.m. and turn off at
midnight.
 Countdown timer: This simple type is often used with heat lamps.
 Seven-day timer: Figure 5-4 shows this timer, which replaces a single-
pole or three-way switch. This timer doesn’t require a neutral to be pre-
sent, but it does require a battery. A manual override allows local
control, but is a little bit clumsy to access.
Many timers are just single-pole switches. Some others require a neutral wire
or batteries. When installing new wiring, make sure you have a neutral wire in
any box where you intend to install a timer. If your project is a retrofit and no
neutral is present, use a mechanical or battery timer or choose a type of
timer that doesn’t require a neutral wire. A good alternative is to use an X10
or UPB timer that is remote from the usage location where a neutral is pre-
sent. One manufacturer offers a digital alarm clock that plugs in to a standard
receptacle. This clock controls up to four X10 addresses and costs about $30.

M
any of the digital home features described in this book — like security
and surveillance systems, intercoms, networks, and remotely controlled
lights — may seem high tech and thrilling. These systems are exciting, and you
may install some of them based on your individual budget and needs. In addi-
tion to digital home upgrades, you can upgrade your phone system. Telephones
became ubiquitous in American homes over the last century, though some
households have gotten rid of their traditional landline phones in favor of cell
phones. This chapter assumes that your home has or will have a traditional
landline phone system with at least one line and a local exchange number.
But just because phones have been around for a long time doesn’t mean that
your system has to use old-fashioned technology or outdated wiring design.
A modern home phone system can incorporate many advanced features that
were only a dream just a few years ago.
In this chapter, we cover the basic things you need to know before wiring or
rewiring your home for phone service. We also cover some more advanced
options to the basic single-phone interface: multi-line systems, facsimile (fax)
installations, in-home phone exchanges, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),
and even videoconferencing. So sit back and get ready to let your fingers do
the walking into your future possibilities with plain old telephone system and
its new pals.

Wiring Your Phone Service
Every home needs at least one phone connection to the outside world — you
know, for ordering pizza or calling 911. The digital home requires additional
phone lines and features for staying connected and in control whether you’re
away from home or tucked into bed. The type of phone service interface your
home uses depends a lot on the Telco (local telephone company) that supplies
your service. Plain old telephone service (POTS) comes to your house from the
phone company’s switch using a pair of copper wires. The wires usually run
fewer than seven miles from the Telco’s switch location to your house.
Some phone companies in major markets offer fiber optic service for phone
and high-speed data services right to your home. Fiber optic links exchange
data digitally, whereas older copper-wire systems exchange analog data. You
need a conversion device to use conventional analog phone sets with digital
fiber optic networks. See Chapter 8 for more information on bringing fiber
optic phone and digital services into your home.
Planning service entrances
Your phone service — whether copper wire or fiber optic — must enter the
house somewhere. This entrance can either be overhead or underground.
The method is sometimes dictated by the home’s location; most new housing
subdivisions prefer, or even require, underground services for all utilities.
The wires to connect your home to the phone system are usually supplied by
the service provider.
 Overhead service: The provider usually supplies all the cable and their
technicians install the phone wires to the customer’s home, at least as
far as the network interface device box.
 Underground phone service: You or your builder will have to check
with your local service provider to see who supplies the service wire
and who’s responsible for installing it.
Identifying the demarcation point
The demarcation point is where the phone company line(s) connects to your
home’s internal wiring. Usually this point is inside a demarc box or Network
Interface Device (NID). Unless you have a maintenance contract with your
Telco, the demarcation point is also the dividing point of wiring responsibil-
ity. Before the demarcation point, the phone company is responsible for
maintaining and repairing the wiring. After the demarcation point, the wiring
is your responsibility.
102
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Using overhead service entrances
If you have overhead service, the phone company will probably install a
demarcation box outside your home. Figure 6-1 shows a typical demarc box
connected to a house. Notice the grounding tab mounted vertically in the
center-left portion of the box. On the upper-right side of the box, a one-line
interface jack is already mounted in the box. The NID also requires a ground-
ing connection running as straight as possible to the electrical service
entrance grounding point with at least a 14-gauge, insulated grounding
copper (stranded or solid) wire listed by Underwriters Laboratory (UL) as suit-
able for grounding. The ground wire should be guarded from potential
damage using conduit. If using metal conduit, ground both ends of the metal
conduit. In this case, using PVC schedule 40 conduit is probably better.
The phone company typically installs only a two-line NID at the demarcation
box. If your system needs to grow beyond two lines at some point, the Telco
may want to come back and install a second NID. This can be unsightly. We
recommend
 Choosing one of these options:
• Buy and install your own six-line NID.
• Insist the phone company use an NID with spaces for more than
two lines.
 Insisting the phone company install a four- or six-pair entrance cable to
match the NID capacity.

cation

103
Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

Figure 6-2 shows a six-place NID box with two lines fully installed on the right
side. In this case, the Telco used Category 3 cable to run to a punch-down
block inside the house, which connects the phone extension home runs
inside the house. In Figure 6-2, notice the cable from the phone pole and the
gray ground conductor coming out of the Telco’s side (the left) of the NID
box. All of the homeowner’s wiring comes out of the box’s right side.
If you look closely at the picture in Figures 6-1 and 6-2, you notice that the
interface between the Telco and the customer sides is a standard RJ-11 jack.
(RJ is short for Registered Jack.) If you’re having trouble with your phone and
want to know whether the problem is in the phone company line or with the
house wiring, disconnect one of the RJ-11 plugs in the NID box and insert a
standard phone cord attached to a phone. If you hear a dial tone and can
make calls from the NID box, then the problem is with your wiring or phone
sets inside the house.
Dealing with underground service entrances
Many newer homes have underground utility service rather than overhead.
The photo in Figure 6-3 shows a pedestal meter socket, which brings power
into the home from underground. On the right of this meter socket is the TV
cable interface box. On the left of the meter socket is the phone interface
box. The phone and cable companies that installed these interfaces did a
marginal job of bringing their underground cables to their respective boxes.
The lines are susceptible to damage from snow blowers, lawn mowers, or
other hazards.

A neater and more professional-looking installation than the one shown in
Figure 6-3 has the following:
 Both interface boxes on the same side of the meter post.
 A protective conduit extending up the wall to just below the interface
boxes.
 A conduit T connection on the top of the extended conduit.
 A conduit below grade to protect the cables both below and above
grade.
 Grounding to the residence’s electric service-grounding electrode
system.
 All of the conduit ends filled with a duct sealer.
The installation should look more like the diagram shown in Figure 6-4.

Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

Planning internal house wiring
The contractor or homeowner is typically responsible for all inside house
wiring leading from the customer side of the phone interface box to all the
phone jacks. Normally wires run from the utility interface box to some desig-
nated connection area in your home. This area could be a utility room, serv-

blocks and the equipment you want to install.
If every variety of communications service enters one designated area in the
house, integration between systems becomes far easier.

Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Some installers like to run serial wires directly from the NID to phone jacks,
going from outlet to outlet inside the home. This method is common yet
obsolete, because it severely limits your phone wiring options. Serial runs are
also harder to troubleshoot and modify if needed. Making home runs from
every outlet to a common location is a far better method.
The photos in Figure 6-5 show a mechanical room where the interface exten-
sion meets the rest of the house wiring. Note the following elements:
 A four-way TV cable splitter shares cable TV with the various rooms in
the house. The cable company did a marginal job with this installation.
The electrical contractor or homeowner will have to clean up this mess.
 A conduit through the wall brings both the TV cable and phone wire into
the house.
 A phone junction block is mounted overhead. This is just a simple
punch-down block connection. Three separate phone lines come in from
the NID box, and this junction block divides those lines among eight
rooms.

Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

The TV and Telco installations pictured in Figure 6-5 are functional, but unfor-
tunately the sloppiness is also typical. The homeowner, builder, or architect
hasn’t defined a higher standard for the location, installation, and connection
of communication equipment. When planning your installation, it should be
 Accessible
 At eye level
 Installed in a neat and orderly fashion
Also, follow the rough-in tips in Chapter 3 and trimming considerations in
Chapter 4. The difference between installing a mess and installing orderly
cables is often just a few extra minutes of work.
Wiring for Conventional Phones
Once the phone wire’s in your home, usually it becomes your responsibility.
Figure 6-6 show a wiring diagram for both phone and TV systems in a typical
home. Most modern homes have more than one phone line, and each line can
serve different locations.
Installing the wiring for your phone system is a big job, but you can take a
logical approach. To install your phone system, follow these basic steps:
1. Choose a central location for your communications equipment.
You can locate a wiring closet, basement, or other location for all your
communications and security systems for when you’re ready to inte-
grate the systems. Co-locating equipment facilitates easier system man-
agement, aids in troubleshooting, and eases integration.
2. Decide which rooms should have phone wiring.
At a minimum, we suggest lines in each habitable room and to any 
workshop areas in the garage or basement. Some people argue against 
a phone line in each room because of cordless phones, or because 
they don’t believe that kids’ rooms need phones. But keep in mind that
cordless phones don’t work when the power is out, and room uses can
change over time. An up-to-date and versatile phone system will proba-
bly increase your home’s resale value.
3. Run the wiring using Cat 6 cable.
108
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Cat 6 cable has eight conductors, consisting of four twisted pairs of 22
or 24 AWG wire. The cable assembly measures about 3⁄16" in diameter. If
you want to have two separate lines in a room — for example, one line
for phone and a second line for fax — you would use two of the four
pairs.

Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

4. Terminate each line with an RJ-11 phone jack.
The RJ-11 standard defines a jack with six wire positions, although nor-
mally it’s only wired with two wires to the center two pins to connect to
single-line phones. Any single-line instrument or device plugged into the
jack looks to pins three and four (the center pins) for a connection. To
accommodate a phone and a fax on separate lines, you need two RJ-11
jacks. Two RJ-11 jacks and a four-space wall plate are pictured in Figure
6-7. Also in the picture is the RJ-45 Ethernet connector, and the F-style
TV cable connector planned for this location.
If you connect a phone line pair to pins three and four, and then connect
another line pair to pins two and five, you can supply two phone numbers to
a standard two-line phone from the standard wall jack. When used in this
configuration, the connection is defined as RJ-14 instead of RJ-11. If you use
all six connections, it’s an RJ-12 jack. Ethernet connectors use eight-pin jacks
and are called RJ-45 jacks.
If you use a two-line phone, you must use the correct type of extension cord
between the phone and the wall jack. Most phone cords supplied with com-
puters and faxes are single line. You can easily check a cord by looking at the
plug end. If you only see two brass connections in the center two slots, it’s a
single-line cord.

Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Installing a Home PBX System
A Private Branch eXchange (PBX) system is a phone network that shares one
or more outside phone lines to make calls external to the PBX network.
You’re probably familiar with the PBX systems that many businesses use, but
you may not know that homes can have them too.
A home PBX system can give you advanced control over your communica-
tions system and offers lots of features:
 Printer ready for generating call reports
 Ring all internal extensions
 Call pickup
 Call waiting
 Call ring back
 Do not disturb function
 Hold music
 In-home room-to-room calls
 Different ring tone patterns for in-home and incoming multi-line calls
 Auto-routing of incoming fax calls to a fax machine
A home PBX system is made up of several components:
 Trunk lines: The outside lines coming from the phone company.
 Extensions: The internal lines within the home.
 Accessory systems: Items such as voicemail, hold music, or an auto-
mated attendant.
 Ports: Each trunk line, extension, and accessory system.
A basic $300 home PBX system may use standard single-line phone sets and
support two Telco trunk lines and seven internal extensions. Models to
handle more lines and features are available for more money.
You have a few options for connecting the wires on a PBX system:
111
Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

 Bring the home runs to a punch-down block near your PBX and then
bring the wires from the PBX ports to the punch-down block.
 Bring the internal phone lines to a predesigned panel for residential 
PBX use, such as the Leviton 18 Port Structured Media Panel. From this
panel, connect patch cords between jacks in the faceplate of the panel
and the various network or phone devices.
When installing your internal home phone wiring, using Cat 6 wire is best.
You only need one or two of the four pairs of wires for a PBX system, depend-
ing on which system you choose. If you have a two-line phone and fax at 
the same location, you could use up to three wire pairs in one cable. Many
designers recommend either installing spare cables, or installing conduit to
make future installs easier. These are good ideas if you wind up using them. If
you never use them, they are just an additional cost, but Cat 6 cable is very
cheap — usually less than $5 per run — and your house may be used in many
different ways over the next few decades. An extra $5 spent now can save
major rewiring expense and hassle later.
Integrating VoIP
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is an increasingly popular alternative to the
conventional public switched phone network. With VoIP, you make your long-
distance calls using Internet protocols (IP). If you have (or plan to have) high-
speed (DSL or cable) Internet access, you may want to consider VoIP for your
long-distance phone calls, because many of the available plans offer highly
competitive pricing.
Understanding how VoIP works
VoIP uses a device commonly referred to as a phone adapter. Some compa-
nies refer to this device as a voice gateway. The VoIP adapter converts the
sound signal from a typical analog phone set to digital IP packets, and vice
versa. The VoIP provider supplies you with this adapter, or you can purchase
a compatible adapter from a list approved by the provider. If you use your
VoIP system to call someone on a conventional analog phone system, the call
goes to the supplier’s nearest conversion point, which sends the call to a
Telco in the call receiver’s area. If both the caller and the receiver are on the
same VoIP network, the call instead goes to their digital IP-connected phone.
112
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Routing phone calls over the Internet is done through a session initiation pro-
tocol (SIP). SIP initiates, alters, and terminates communications sessions
between two or more participating devices over an IP network (the Internet)
for telephony or for a multimedia presentation. To learn more about SIP, see
RFC 2543 at www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2543.txt.
On a VoIP system, the service provider assigns you a phone number. In some
cases, you can choose the area code and phone number that your phone will
use. Some providers allow you to invent a “virtual” number that rings to your
present analog phone. That may be valuable to someone who often calls you
long-distance, because the number is a local call for the other person.
Some VoIP suppliers have you make calls over local phone lines to their local
or toll-free exchange equipment instead. Their equipment converts your voice
to a digital signal and transmits it over the Internet. Check the details of any
plan before deciding on one:
 Check the cost for making calls.
 Watch out for unexpected long-distance tolls your caller may be
charged.
VoIP phone numbers aren’t currently available in every area of the country.
If the only phone service you have is provided on VoIP, your phone may not
work during a power outage. Directory and 911 services may be unreliable,
too. Make sure you have some way to quickly reach emergency services if
necessary.
Choosing a VoIP phone adapter
VoIP phone adapters are aimed at two different audiences:
 The home-user mass market with do-it-yourself installations.
 Small businesses, where the adapter is provided by a value-added
reseller or partner of the hardware manufacturer or the VoIP provider.
We expect that with time some of the advanced features currently available
to the small business market will trickle down to the mass market, allowing
home offices and the digital homeowner to use and enjoy the advanced fea-
tures and services. The following sections introduce you to consumer- and
business-style VoIP adapters.
113
Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

Consumer VoIP adapters
Consumer-style VoIP adapters typically have four or eight ports. The follow-
ing list describes these ports so that you can recognize their purposes:
 Power port: The first port on a VoIP adapter is for power supply. It is
usually low voltage DC from an adapter that plugs into your nearest
power outlet.
 Up-line Ethernet port (WAN): One up-line Ethernet port is for connec-
tion to the line from your Internet modem, firewall, or router using an
Ethernet cable. This port is often called the wide-area network (WAN)
port. In Chapter 12, we recommend using a firewall or a router with
built-in firewall on your broadband Internet connection. We also recom-
mend using a multi-port Ethernet switch to distribute the network to the
drops in your house. If you use an Ethernet switch, the up-line Ethernet
jack on the VoIP adapter connects to the switch.
 Down-line Ethernet ports (LAN): The VoIP adapter may have one, four,
or more down-line Ethernet ports (also referred to as the local-area net-
work (LAN) ports). If the VoIP adapter has a built-in Ethernet switch, you
could connect your computers or network drops to these LAN ports.
However, if your network already has another Ethernet switch, then
these ports on the VoIP adapter are unnecessary.
 Down-line analog phone ports: Usually the VoIP adapter provides two
phone ports with standard RJ-11 jacks. They’re labeled port one and
port two, and connect to analog phones and options such as a fax or
second phone line. Typically, port one must connect to the phone.
Most consumer-style VoIP adapters are designed on the assumption that
homeowners are going to approach VoIP phone service as an either-or propo-
sition. This means that many adapters don’t include a port for connecting a
conventional phone to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
Because of the reliability issues surrounding VoIP, as well as the inability to
call 911 emergency services, we view this lack of a PSTN connection as a dis-
service to the consumer. A notable exception is the OneFlex adapter (offered
by QWEST), which has a port referred to as a Line (Failover) Port. This port
connects to the PSTN for 911 calls over a normal phone line to the local
phone company.
Figure 6-8 shows a diagram of the preferred method of installing a consumer-
style VoIP adapter on your home network. Notice that the adapter is installed
downstream of the router. You can install the VoIP adapter directly to the
modem, but doing so reduces the control and level of security you can
enforce on your data traffic. Keep in mind that these devices need electrical
power, so if you lose power, you can’t call 911 or make other calls. (See
Chapter 15 for ways to add backup power to your critical digital systems.)

Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Business VoIP adapters
Business-style VoIP adapters differ from consumer adapters in that the phone
sets are IP based; the signal conversion from analog to digital is performed
within the phones. The phone sets connect to a multi-line-capable IP PBX
using Ethernet connections. A typical IP PBX may handle up to 16 IP-based

phone sets. The IP PBX may include two Foreign eXchange Subscriber (FXS)
RJ-11 ports for connecting conventional analog phones or fax machines. The
PBX gateway may also include a Foreign eXchange Office (FX0) RJ-11 port for
connecting to the PSTN for handling calls when the Internet is down and for
routing local calls to emergency 911. Business PBX equipment also usually
includes features like voice mail, hold music, group calling, paging, and call
forwarding.
IP PBXs usually require close integration by the VoIP provider or the value-
added reseller to install and configure. Some of the tips we mention in
Chapter 1 for selecting an electrical contractor also apply to selecting a VoIP
provider or reseller. However, we expect that many of the advanced business
VoIP features will trickle down to consumer-level VoIP in the near future.
Choosing a VoIP service provider
If you have a high-speed Internet connection through a cable or DSL modem,
you are a candidate for VoIP services. Many providers have feature-rich serv-
ice offerings and competitive prices. Geography isn’t a huge limitation for
deciding on a particular service provider, so compare plans and rates.
Carefully consider the following points:
 Price: Consider monthly access fees as well as per-call fees.
 Phone numbers: Can you choose an area code and phone number, or
are you locked into a specific number or range by the provider?
 Equipment: Which provider offers the best equipment for your home?
Most VoIP service providers list which equipment is compatible with
their service.
 Technical support: Does the provider offer good tech support both for
your equipment and the service?
Videoconferencing from Home
If you work from home or want to keep in touch with distant family members,
you could benefit from outfitting your digital home with videoconferencing
capability beyond what’s available on various picture phones. In the follow-
ing sections, we show you how to keep in touch visually with family, friends,
and business associates.
116
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Equipping for videoconferencing
Due to the early adoption and acceptance of the International Telecommunica-
tion Union (ITU) H.323 family of standards, you can use a home computer
equipped with a webcam, network interface card (NIC), and a high-speed
Internet connection to conduct videoconferences with anyone on the
Internet. A version of Microsoft NetMeeting — a popular videoconferencing
application — is available for Windows 95 and higher. A videoconferencing
application like NetMeeting can use one of two types of connections to place
videoconferencing calls:
 IP: If you have a broadband Internet connection such as DSL or a cable
modem, you can place conferencing calls over that connection.
 Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN): If you have minimal need
for an Internet connection, or if broadband Internet isn’t available in
your area, see if your phone company offers ISDN service. ISDN is typi-
cally slower and more expensive than DSL or cable, but is well suited to
videoconferencing. Like DSL, ISDN allows voice and data to be transmit-
ted simultaneously using end-to-end digital connectivity. This connectiv-
ity is achieved by sending signals at different frequencies on the same
pair of wires.
Installing and using ISDN phone lines
ISDN lines use standard copper phone wires to transmit one channel of
64Kbps (kilobits per second) of data, or two channels totaling 128Kbps of
data. Two-channel ISDN service is required for videoconferencing, and ISDN
service must be installed and supported by your local Telco. Once ISDN serv-
ice is installed to your home, connect an ISDN terminal adapter and modem
to a phone jack. You can now perform point-to-point videoconferences to
equally equipped locations.
The wiring for an ISDN phone jack isn’t any different than wiring a standard
phone line, except that the twisted-pair cable (Cat 3, Cat 5, or Cat 6) from the
NID box to the phone jack where the ISDN modem is connected must be able
to handle the 64Kbps speeds of each phone line channel.
Using ISDN is simple once you connect it and configure your application. Use the
software to dial the recipient’s ISDN number. Your call routes to the receiver’s
number over the PSTN. If he or she answers, you can begin conferencing.
Using IP-based videoconferencing
It isn’t necessary to use ISDN and pay tolls for videoconferencing because 
the communication protocols, hardware, and applications that conform 
to the H.323 standard can also be used to connect point to point over the
117
Chapter 6: Wiring Your Home Phone System

Internet. If you plan to do a lot of videoconferencing, try to get two or more
assigned static IP addresses from your Internet service provider. This makes
conferencing easier because other parties can simply dial your conferencing
IP address.
At this point you might ask, “Do I need VoIP service to do videoconferences
over the Internet?” Thanks for asking! The answer is no; all you need is a
decent upload and download speed with your ISP — any 256Kbps DSL or
faster connection should suffice — and an IP address associated with your
conferencing software. You can then place conferencing calls to other IP
addresses or ISDN numbers.
Often, large companies with extensive WANs use private addresses within
their own network for videoconferencing. If you work from home, you may be
able to link to conferences via a secure company gateway, thereby minimizing
office commutes.
Using gateways for multi-point 
conferencing
The videoconferencing standards for ISDN and IP conferencing also allow 
use of multi-point control unit (MCU) gateways — a device for controlling 
and broadcasting data packets to more than one end point. An H.323/H.320
gateway translates ISDN videoconferencing packets to IP connection points,
allowing the dissimilar conferences standards (IP and ISDN) to communicate.
This allows multiple participants into the videoconference at the same time.
Gateways can be managed by a third party and scheduled for a particular
user call time or unmanaged services operated on a first-come, first-served
basis. Prices for multi-port MCUs are about $4,000.
Many third parties, such as Sprint Business Services, offer multi-point video-
conferencing hubs for a fee. These virtual hubs can bridge between ISDN and
IP connections as required. You could also install your own multi-point gate-
way if your ISP has provided you with enough IP addresses. Most home users
don’t do enough multi-point conferences to justify the cost of a gateway.

O
ne of the things that really sets the modern digital home apart is an
advanced communications system. Want to talk to someone on the
other side of the house? This used to mean yelling or going to that room. A
public address system eliminates that need, allowing instant and convenient
communication with anyone in any room in your home.
Of course, public address and intercom systems are nothing new. But modern
systems can do much more than simply allow you to talk. Other available fea-
tures include
 Music, surveillance video, and weather alerts
 Doorbell notification
 Door lock control
 Outdoor and garage communication
 Baby monitors
 TV and entertainment system control
This chapter introduces you to the features available in a home public address
system, and shows you how to plan for and install one in your digital home.

Planning a Home Communications
System
As you plan your communications system, it makes sense to design it around
your other multimedia systems. Can you incorporate the public address system
into your speakers? Would you like to add video features or music to the
intercom installations? These are just a couple of considerations.
Of course, planning the system also means choosing intercom components
and mapping out wiring runs. Several kinds of systems are available, each
with different advantages that may or may not mesh with your lifestyle. The
following sections help you start planning.
Selecting locations
Deciding what you want included in an intercom system and then wiring the
home to accommodate the system is a basic step-by-step process:
1. Decide which rooms will have intercoms.
2. Select intercom units with sufficient capabilities to meet your needs.
3. Draw a wiring map.
4. Wire the house per the intercom manufacturer’s instructions.
You may decide to simply install an intercom in every room. But if you decide
to place intercoms only in certain rooms, consider bringing wire to all the
rooms so that they can be included later if desired. Cat 6 wire — the type
used for most intercom systems — costs only pennies per foot. It only costs
about $5 to pre-wire an average-sized room if you are providing the labor.
Keep in mind some basic rules and tips when wiring for intercom systems:
 You don’t have to install an outlet box if you’re only pre-wiring for a pos-
sible future expansion; simply get the wire in the wall cavity behind the
drywall where you can later install a low voltage (LV) ring to accommo-
date the equipment.
 The rough in is generally done just inside the room next to the door. The
installation height should be 5' above the finished floor.
 Don’t run Cat 5 or 6 wires directly alongside wires for the electric power
system. When two energized conductors are placed next to each other, a
120
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

charge difference and electric field exists between them. The charge dif-
ference causes capacitance, which gives rise to noticeable interference.
(Capacitance is electrical charge induced in one conductor by its prox-
imity to the electromagnetic field of another when they’re separated by
electrical insulating material.) Normally the interference source is from a
60-cycle, 120- or 240-volt power line. These charge differences produce a
60-cycle audio tone called hum.
Ground loops can also cause interference with sound quality. All
grounds should be connected to one grounding point. This ground point
should be common with (meaning connected to) the electrical service
ground. Once an item is grounded, it should not be grounded at another
point or through another system.
Modern TVs don’t come with grounded plugs. If they did, connecting 
an RG-6 coaxial from a cable company or satellite dish would ground 
the TV a second time and create a ground loop, thus leading to notice-
able interference.
 If you want stereo sound in a room, run additional wires to the wall or
ceiling speaker locations.
 An alternative to pre-wiring a house is to provide an easy method for
getting wires to future installation areas. You have a couple of options:
• Run conduit to those areas. In the case of a first floor over a base-
ment, install a short piece from an electrical box through the floor
into the basement, if the basement is to remain unfinished.
• Run conduit to some other accessible location, such as the attic.
Fasten the conduit to the stud and mark it on the blueprint. An LV
ring can be cut in later. The conduit should end a few inches below
or above the eventual LV ring installation. Use 3⁄4" or 1" Electrical
Nonmetallic Conduit (ENT). A 1" conduit accommodates about six
Cat 6 cables. If you need more capacity, install a second conduit.
Installing ENT conduit is fairly easy. It is easily bent by hand and
can be cut with a knife, but do not make sharp bends. Larger
radius sweeps make it easier to pull wires though the conduit.
Figure 7-1 shows two 4 × 4" boxes and plaster rings, as well as
some ENT conduit and fittings.
When running conduit, you’re limited to a total of 360° of bend in any
run between pull points. Four 90° bends or any combination that add up
to 360° is the maximum allowed. If more than 360° are needed, you must
install a pull box. Each pull box starts the degree count over again. Not
only is it a code violation to exceed 360° of bends between pull points, it
is usually impossible to pull wires in a conduit that has more than 360°
of bends. Resist any temptation to exceed the limit.
121
Chapter 7: Installing a Public Address System

We assume in this chapter that the building finish is drywall. Your building
finish could be something else, but the installation process is the same.
The diagram shown in Figure 7-2 is an example layout of a voice intercom
system with auxiliary input and stereo sound. The manufacturer’s recom-
mended cable for wiring this system is Cat 5, and Cat 6 could be used as an
upgrade.
Choosing wire
If you plan to pre-wire, how can you match the current carrying capacity of
the wire to a future system? A number of intercom systems recommend using
16 or 18 AWG wire, but we believe that most future systems will use Cat 5 or
Cat 6 wire. These systems send a higher voltage to the remote wall units; Cat 6
wire has about double the resistance of 18 AWG wire. You may have some line
losses with Cat 6 wire on these systems, but they are generally insignificant.
Figure 7-1:

122
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Some home music systems use Cat 5 or 6 cable for external controllers, but
they generally use heavier-gauge wire (usually 14–18 gauge) from the local
amplifier to the speakers. The voltage required to make a lot of noise in a
normal speaker is very low, but the advantage of high-current, low-voltage
speaker wiring is that almost nothing interferes with the audio signal.
Selecting amplifiers and speakers
Amplifiers, or amps, help provide adequate power to speakers. Like speakers,
amplifiers usually have a wattage rating, but about half of that wattage is lost
inside the amp. This means that the amplifier capacity can be twice as large
as the speaker loads connected to it. Despite the tendency to turn the volume
up to 11 for our favorite tunes, the amp’s purpose is to simply bring the
volume up to the natural level of the instruments originally used to create the
music, including the human voice. If the amp-and-speaker combination is too
weak to reach equity, the instrument’s full fidelity sound is impossible.
Having to crank the controls to the max distorts the sound.

Chapter 7: Installing a Public Address System

Selecting amps with a full frequency range of 20 to 20,000 cycles per second
allows hearing of the harmonics and overtones of bells and stringed instruments.
In the future we expect to see more Cat 6 cable wiring local amplifier/speaker
combination units, thus eliminating the need for heavy speaker wire. With
this design, the speaker/amp unit needs four or six conductors depending on
the volume-control scheme. Cat 5 and Cat 6 cable each contain eight conduc-
tors, which are made up of four twisted pairs arranged in a single sheathed
jacket. The difference is that Cat 5 cable handles frequencies up to 100 MHz,
and Cat 6 cable handles frequencies up to 250 MHz. Crosstalk between pairs
is also reduced with Cat 6 cable.
Choosing intercom components
You have many intercom system and component brands from which to
choose. A typical home intercom system can accommodate up to six remote
speaker locations and chimes from three doors for about $250. At this price
the units usually have built-in AM/FM radio receivers. As you move up, the
units may have one or more auxiliary inputs that let you connect your own
music system and distribute it to the connected speakers (in mono).
If you install an electric door strike on your front door, you can unlock the
door for identified visitors from the master station and use the intercom to
tell them to enter the house.
In addition to a voice intercom, you can have a video intercom. Video inter-
com systems use a small camera in the intercom unit to monitor any room on
the system. They aren’t complicated to wire: just four-conductor 18 AWG
wire. You may find it advantageous to see who’s ringing the doorbell before

Step down, transformers
Commercial sound systems use 25- or 70-volt
line output from the amplifier, which is then
stepped down with a speaker-mounted trans-
former. Transformer step-down systems aren’t
considered suitable for re-creating high-fidelity
music because of the nonlinear frequency
response of any transformer. Some newer sys-
tems can drive 70 volts directly to the speakers,
eliminating the transformer and thereby improv-
ing sound quality.

you remotely unlock it, or you may wish to see what the kids are up to. These
video stations cost about $1,000 each. We cover other ways to do video moni-
toring throughout your home in Chapter 14.
Most intercom systems require a four-conductor cable run from the master
location to each remote speaker location. You also need to supply 120-volt
power at the master station.
Installing the Hardware
After you’ve planned out your home communications system, including 
planning the wiring and selecting components, it’s time to actually install 
the components.
Installing LV rings
LV rings hold your intercom components to the wall. Figure 7-3 shows two
single-gang LV rings. The LV ring on the left shows the drywall tabs folded
back, which you do after inserting into the hole cut in the wall. The tabs pro-
vide a catch for the drywall screw and, when tightened, firmly mounts the
ring to the wallboard. The ring on the right shows how they come in the
package.
To install an LV ring, follow these steps:
1. Cut a hole through the drywall the size of the raised, inner, open rec-
tangle of the LV ring.
Notice the tabs across the opening of the LV ring. The tabs are part of
the raised area away from what will be the frontal surface.
2. Insert the LV ring in the hole and fold the tabs as shown on the left LV
ring in Figure 7-3.
3. Install screws in the slots in each tab of the LV ring.
When the screws are tightened, the drywall is firmly sandwiched between
the tabs and the frontal ring. The frontal flange keeps the ring from going
into the wall, and the tabs and screws keep it from coming out.
You can mount LV rings anywhere in the drywall between studs. They don’t
have to be secured to a stud. The rings are available in one- and two-gang
configurations, and are only approved for low-voltage wiring. Never use them
for mounting a power switch or outlet.
125
Chapter 7: Installing a Public Address System

Installing a central control unit
Put the communications system’s main console in a convenient, accessible
area. The main console has a few more features than the remote room units:
 Optional door release
 Talk switch
 Master volume control
 Status light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to show system activity
If the main console is the Great and Powerful Oz that gives you command of
your intercom system, the central unit is the man behind the curtain who
actually does all the work. The central control unit is usually located in a
basement or mechanical closet. This should be where all your phone, net-
work, TV, and security system controls are located.
Figure 7-3:

Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

This central unit needs
 120-volt power
 Two Cat 5 or Cat 6 runs to the main console unit
 One Cat 5 or Cat 6 run to all the room stations, including the door,
garage, and patio units
Figure 7-4 shows modern intercom system wiring. This system uses Cat 5 or 6
cable to all stations. The main console requires two Cat 5 or 6 cables to the
central control unit. The diagram doesn’t show it, but the system also needs
a 120-volt power supply.
Connecting radio antennas
If your intercom unit has an AM/FM radio, you probably need to include
wiring for an external antenna, which goes to either the central console loca-
tion or to the central control unit. When pre-wiring for broadcast radio
(AM/FM) antennas, bring in two RG-6 cables from a high location on one of
the gable ends of the house, down to outlets near the equipment.

Chapter 7: Installing a Public Address System

Include a grounding block with a grounding strap before the cables enter the
house. Antennas are attractive to lightning bolts, so properly grounding
antenna cables is very important. Grounding must be to the electrical service
grounding electrode system, as covered in Chapters 2 and 3. Grounding in
two places can create ground loops and thus interference, so use a ground
loop isolator when connecting the patch cable from the outlet box connector
to the intercom/radio equipment.
Select the antennas for AM and FM radio based on the recommendations
from the intercom manufacturer, and then follow all of the antenna manufac-
turer’s recommendations for safe and secure mounting. You may want to
install a waterproof connection box with RG-6 connectors near the antenna
locations, and use a jumper cable from the outlet box, as shown in Figure 7-5.
This eases future antenna maintenance or replacement. Always arrange the
wires with a drip loop to minimize water buildup in the cable and corrosion
at the connection points.
Installing and wiring remote locations
All remote stations for your intercom system are connected to the system
using Cat 5 or Cat 6 cable. If you install an intercom in an unattached garage,
gazebo, tree house, or some other remote location, you must use cable rated
for direct burial. If part of the cable is exposed — as in the case of a tree
house — the cable must also be sunlight resistant.
128
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 
Feeling punchy
A punch-down tool presses the wires between
two metal blades that cut through the insulation
and hold the wires and create an electrical con-
nection between the wires in that slot. When
using a punch-down tool with a trimmer, make
sure the tool is oriented so the trimmer cuts off
the unneeded slack, as opposed to cutting the
wire you’re terminating.

Chapter 7: Installing a Public Address System

Follow the recommendations in Chapter 3 for your roughing in your wires.
Basically, you should
 Maintain as much separation as possible between parallel runs of elec-
trical and communications wiring to prevent interference.
 Drill straight (not angled) holes in joists and framing, which makes for a
cleaner installation and easier pulls.
 Drill holes far enough back that drywall screws won’t contact the wires.
 Staple wires on vertical runs so they don’t hang loose within the wall.
Again, these are just the basics. See Chapter 3 for more on running wires.
Unlike electrical wiring, all wiring runs from remote intercoms are home runs
to the central control unit wiring location.
When making the wire runs to the control unit from the remotes, follow these
tips to make the final connections easier:
 Take advantage of color coding. Cat 5 and Cat 6 cable are made up of
color-coded pairs within the sheath, so simply use the same color wires
on the same terminals from each remote intercom.
 Label your cables. Carefully label each cable as each home run is
brought to the central location so that you know which room is served
by each respective cable.
 Block and jump. If the units don’t have spring-loaded push connections
for the wires, you may want to use a punch-down block to terminate the
remote runs and use jumper wires from the punch-down block to the
screw terminals on the intercom equipment. This connection helps elim-
inate wire breakage and facilitates easier maintenance or replacement.
In some rooms, such as nurseries or children’s playrooms, you may want to
install intercoms lower than the standard 5' mounting height. An intercom at
about 3' allows a small child to easily reach the intercom. Wire this station
from above or, if fed from below, maintain sufficient slack in the cable during
rough in; that way you can move the unit higher on the wall if the playroom
later becomes a guest bedroom. Removing the LV ring, and then patching,
plastering, and painting over the old opening on drywall board walls is easy.

Installing Cable TV and Advanced
Digital Services
In This Chapter
 Planning TV rooms
 Installing TV cables and connections
 Using fiber optics in your digital home
T
he human body is made up of systems: the circulatory system, the nervous
system, the digestive system, and a bunch of other systems we forgot to list
on our seventh-grade biology test. Likewise, many systems work together in
your modern digital home: electrical, telephone, security, intercom, and others.
Most modern homes also include a cable TV system, which is one of the sys-
tems we cover in this chapter. This may include conventional cable TV serv-
ice using coaxial cable, or your area may be served by advanced new fiber
optic systems. Fiber optics TV systems are gaining popularity because they
offer data transmission speeds potentially far higher than any wired system
in existence. In addition, fiber optics can supply many services simultane-
ously over one fiber cable pair. This chapter shows you how to plan your
home’s cable TV system, as well as how to plan for advanced fiber optics-
based digital services.
Readying Your Home for Prime Time
As with any electrical system in your home, careful planning is critical.
1. List the end-use equipment you intend to install and use in your
home.
That list may include TV sets, DVD players, VCRs, and WebTV.
2. Select the areas you want wired to TV jacks.

At a minimum, these locations should generally include each bedroom,
living room, and family room. The kitchen and dining room may seem
optional to some folks, but we recommend wiring at least one TV jack to
all habitable rooms. In larger rooms you may want to install more than
one TV jack to accommodate alternative furniture arrangements.
Bringing TV service into your home
In most markets, the cable company’s installer will make the service drop
from the pole or underground service to an interface box on your house. For
a fee, they’re willing to install the in-house wiring to each TV in your home.
If you choose to have the cable company install the in-house wiring, you have
little control over the quality of the installation. Cable company installers
often run cable on the surface, and they like to drill holes in baseboards and
hardwood flooring.
They can get away with this because TV cable installations usually aren’t sub-
ject to the same level of critical inspection as home electrical wiring. Your
best bet is to have the cable company stop at the interface box and handle
the rest of it yourself. You can then either perform a clean installation or hire
a reputable installer who will work within your guidelines.
Figure 8-1 shows a simple cable interface box. Besides the TV cables, the box
also includes a ground wire that is connected to the grounding electrode
system for your electrical service. A simple splitter is on the right side of the
box in Figure 8-1; it splits the single incoming cable in two for the home. One
supplies a cable TV signal and the other supplies broadband Internet to a
cable modem. A single TV cable should run from the interface box to your
internal distribution point where you would have distribution blocks. Cable
companies in most markets don’t allow the homeowner to make modifica-
tions within the interface box.
If the incoming cable TV signal isn’t strong enough to supply all of your loca-
tions, install a broad-spectrum amplifier to strengthen the incoming signal.
Installing TV cable jacks
You should install cable TV jacks in much the same manner you do phone
jacks. That is, each jack should be a direct home run to the distribution point
served by the line coming into the house. Figure 6-6 in Chapter 6 shows a dia-
gram of the ideal cable and telephone-line arrangement. When you decide the
locations for TV jacks, mount the boxes or plaster rings to which the TV
jacks will attach.
132
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Unless you have one of those special new TVs that runs on hamster wheels,
you are going to need an electrical outlet near each cable TV jack. One of 
the neater ways to accomplish this is to use a combination outlet box like the
one shown in Figure 8-2. This specialty box encloses all wiring as required by
code, plus it has a companion open-back box for low-voltage wiring such as
the TV cable connector. This combination makes for a neater appearance than
separately spaced boxes, and it makes setting up your TVs more convenient.
You can split out lines from existing TV jacks using coaxial splitters (available
at any electronics store), but the signal may have reduced quality. Each time
the cable gets split, the signal gets weaker. We recommend that you only split
TV lines from existing outlets during remodels where installing new home
runs is difficult.
TV jacks are designed to mount to single-gang electrical boxes. Because there
is no high voltage present in a TV cable line, a box isn’t necessarily required.
You can mount a 4" × 4" plaster ring, tile ring, or low-voltage (LV) ring to the
stud (framing) and just bring the cable out through the ring opening. Plaster
rings are available in plastic and metal. Choose a plaster ring that matches
the building finish of the surrounding walls.

Chapter 8: Installing Cable TV and Advanced Digital Services

Installing TV cable
When you install cable between your distribution point and the cable jacks,
we recommend that you use RG-6 cable. This newer style is superior to older
RG-59 TV cable, because you can run it near parallel power cables without
any problem. RG-6 cable is shielded, thus protecting it from power line 
interference.
When you’re installing TV cable, follow these general guidelines:
 The TV cable shield must be grounded at the customer interface by the
cable company. If you’re installing a dish system, ground the cable’s
shield to the service panel’s grounding electrode before it enters the
building. If the cable shield gets grounded a second time, it may cause
an audio hum or a degraded picture due to ground loop interference.
 Terminate each RG-6 cable end using a good-quality F connector. Follow
the manufacturer’s instructions and use the crimping tool recommended
by the F connector’s supplier. F connectors aren’t standardized, so make
sure the crimper matches the connector style you’re using.
Figure 8-2:

134
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Some cable companies supply free RG-6 cable with F connectors. The
cable company may install the F connectors on your system even if they
don’t supply or run the RG-6 cable, thus saving you the cost of a crimp-
ing tool.
 The TV-set end of each cable connects to a cable TV wall jack. You will
probably install the wall-jack faceplate after the building finish is in
place.
 From the wall jack to the TV, use a flexible video jumper cable no longer
than needed to easily reach from the jack to the television. Excessively
long cables reduce signal strength.
Don’t use heavy TV cable like that supplied by the cable company for
the connection between the wall jack and the TV. These heavy, inflexible
cables can break or damage the connector on the TV.
135
Chapter 8: Installing Cable TV and Advanced Digital Services
Understanding decibels and signal loss
Each time a TV cable is connected to a device
or to another cable, you lose about 8 dB (deci-
bels) of signal strength. Some signal strength is
also lost with each foot of cable. The loss on
RG-6 cable can easily reach 6 dB over a 100-
foot run. The video signal frequency also influ-
ences the amount of loss, with higher
frequencies susceptible to higher loss rates.
Thus, you can see why it’s important to be as
efficient as possible with your cable installa-
tions. Try to keep your cable runs short and con-
nection numbers small.
Decibel measurements and what they mean are
often hard to understand. Decibels measure the
relative strength (plus or minus) of an electrical
signal as an amount equal to ten times the
common logarithm of the ratio of the two mea-
surements. Losses are negative numbers and
gains are positive. In the case of TV cable, at the
source point from the interface box on your
house the cable company supplies you with a
certain signal strength; for reference purposes
that becomes 0 dB in signal loss or gain. Each
time the signal goes through a connector, the
signal loss could be as high as –8 dB. For every
100' of cable the signal passes through, it loses
–6 dB to the loss column. For example, if you
have a cable run of 100' and two connectors,
the signal loss would be about –22 dB (–6 dB +
–8 dB + –8 dB = –22 dB).
The frequency of the signal going through the
cable also dramatically influences the loss, with
higher frequencies susceptible to higher loss
rates. Because this measurement is a log scale,
the numbers appear to understate the actual
loss. For example, the additional loss difference
each time you go from –10 dB to –20 dB is not a
linear 10; it is times 10. So a signal after a –20 dB
loss is 1⁄100 the strength of the reference signal.

Connecting the common distribution point
The common distribution point is where TV cable home runs join the service
wire from the cable company. To set up the distribution point, follow these
steps:
1. Install the lightning surge protection connector on the TV service
cable to the grounding electrode before any splitters.
This provides lightning protection to your cable system. Some designers
recommend that you connect the surge protection to a ground rod, but
we strongly disagree. The lightning surge protection must be connected
to the electrical service ground, as discussed in Chapter 3.
2. If you have a cable Internet modem, install a two-way splitter on the
service cable right as it comes into the house.
Connect one branch cable from the first splitter directly to your cable
modem, and use as short a cable as possible. This ensures the best pos-
sible signal strength for your Internet connection. The other branch
from the two-way splitter feeds your home’s cable TV system common
distribution block.
3. At the common distribution point, install a splitter (like the one shown
in Figure 8-3) with just enough connections to wire to each TV jack
you will install.
If you have a cable Internet connection, you’ll install a second splitter 
on the cable for the TV signal to feed a cable to each TV, as shown in
Figure 8-4.
4. Connect the cables that feed the home TV jacks to the splitter.
Only connect cables for the TV jacks actually being used. This ensures
that you aren’t wasting signal strength on unused cables.
5. If you’re using more than six jacks, install a wide-band amplifier to
ensure adequate signal strength to each jack.
If you have a lot of long runs and many connections, choose an amplifier
with frequency ranges that cover the channel frequencies you will be
using. Also make sure that the amplifier at least equals your calculated
dB losses. (See the previous section for more on dB loss.) Install the
amplifier right before the TV splitter block, but after the splitter feeding
your cable modem, if you have one.
6. Connect a TV to a wall jack, pop some popcorn, grab the remote, and
see how well the system works!
Figure 8-4 shows a properly configured TV cabling system.

Chapter 8: Installing Cable TV and Advanced Digital Services

Installing for a Fiber Optic Future
For more than a century, most communications cabling — be it for cable TV
or telephone service — has been composed of copper wire. Signals are car-
ried over these copper wires electrically. A few decades ago phone compa-
nies started installing fiber optic cable for long-distance voice and data
connections. Fiber optic cable carries signals optically, making it far less sus-
ceptible to signal loss over long distances. Another advantage is that by
using Dense Wave Distribution Multiplexing (DWDM), a fiber pair can be
divided into dozens of channels, each supporting a different type of signal or
protocol. (A protocol defines how data is coded and decoded on a transmis-
sion media such as copper or fiber.) For example, a fiber optic cable can
carry Ethernet over one color of the DWDM; TV channels over another color;
and standard phone, ATM, or ISDN data packets over another color. Over
time this feature will allow advanced digital services to be provided directly
to the devices in your home.
Most internal connections are still done with copper wire. Likewise, copper
wire is used for most wiring between phone company switches and customer
homes. But a few progressive companies like Verizon believe that fiber optic
is the way of the future, and are offering fiber optic service directly to cus-
tomers’ homes in some major markets. The following sections show you how
to prepare your digital home for the fiber optic future.
Understanding fiber optic cable
The fiber part of a fiber optic cable is actually made of glass. Data is carried
by pulsing infrared light waves in the wavelength ranges of 850–1,550
nanometers. As the light waves emerge from the far end of the glass cable,
the waves are converted back to electrical impulses by a light-sensitive
receiver.
Fiber optic cables are divided into two categories:
 Single-mode fiber: Often referred to as mono-mode and uni-mode cable,
single-mode fiber is very thin, usually only 8–10 µ (microns) in diameter.
They conduct light impulses straight down the small center glass core of
the fiber. The smaller size makes it more suitable to carry signals over
longer distances.
 Multi-mode fiber: Ranging from 50–100 µ in diameter, multi-mode fiber
carries data over shorter distances. Multi-mode is mostly cables within
buildings and for on-campus connections between buildings. If used
138
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

over long distances, the light waves attenuate against the outer shell in
the larger fiber causing signal problems. The two most popular sizes are
50 µ and 62.5 µ. You could use either size when cabling your home, but
the 62.5-µ cable is currently the most widely used.
A new plastic variant of fiber optic cable is called POF, or plastic optical fiber.
POF is gaining popularity for connecting high-end audio equipment. However,
you can’t use POF interchangeably with multi-mode or single-mode fiber
optic cable.
Consider your fiber optic strategy
How and whether you prepare your home for fiber optic services depends
greatly on where you live and what services are currently available to you.
Depending on where you live, you may approach fiber optic service using
one of three strategies:
 The “Be Ready” strategy: If fiber optic service is already available in
your area or you know it will be soon, this is your strategy.
1. Run a fiber optic pair to every box location to which you’re
installing Ethernet cable.
2. Terminate the box using a six-way faceplate like the one shown in
Figure 8-5.
3. In the faceplate, install two RJ-45 Ethernet connectors, two RJ-11
phone connectors, one MT-RJ fiber (pair) workstation connector,
and one RG-6 F-style video connector.
4. Take all home runs to your central distribution point.
 The “May Need It Soon” strategy: Follow this strategy if you think
there’s a good chance of fiber optic service coming to your neighbor-
hood in the near future, but there are no immediate plans in place. In
this case, pull a fiber optic pair to each Ethernet location, and simply
leave the fiber pair un-terminated. It will be there if you ever need it.
 The “Need It Someday” strategy: If fiber optic service doesn’t seem
likely in your area anytime soon, but you want to make sure your home
never becomes obsolete, install 1⁄2" or 3⁄4" PVC conduit to all Ethernet
locations. This allows fiber optic cable to be easily run in the future, if
necessary.
When running conduit there should be no more than 360 degrees of bend
between pull boxes, and keep the radius of bends to no fewer than 2".
139
Chapter 8: Installing Cable TV and Advanced Digital Services

Choosing home fiber optic service
If fiber optic phone, data, and video service is available in your area, we rec-
ommend that you move this option to the top of your list. This is especially
true if your service provider allows you to buy two or more static IP
addresses. As we mention in Chapter 12, if you only have a dynamically
assigned IP address, you are limited on some of the other cool communica-
tion stuff.
You don’t absolutely have to get your phone, cable, and Internet services
from the same provider. In fact, having Internet service provided by both the
cable and phone companies may be a good idea, particularly if you rely on
Internet for your home office and one company won’t give you two static IPs
or other premium services that you want. A static pair of IP addresses on a
slow service may be better than none at all.
When you order service, the phone company sends an installer to connect the
fiber cable to your home systems at some interface point, much as connec-
tions are made for phone or TV cable service. The trained installer runs the
Figure 8-5:

tions.
140
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

fiber optic cable overhead or underground to a predetermined location at
your home, terminating to the fiber cable connection at the optical network ter-
minal (ONT), which in turn will feed to your home’s common distribution
point for the services provided, such as analog phone service or TV channels.
Connecting to fiber optic devices
If fiber optics have one downside, it’s the nearly 100 styles of connectors
used for terminations, cable-to-cable connections (splices), and jumpers. This
variety can make connecting your devices to fiber optic services challenging,
to say the least. But some connection types are more popular:
 ST or straight connector: This barrel-shaped connector looks like a BNC
connector. The ST connector is used extensively.
 SC or square snap-in connector: A duplex arrangement normally sports
these. Other duplex connectors include the MT-RJ and the MTP.
 SFF or small form factor connector: This connector allows two cables
to connect into the same space as one SC connector. They’re used in
high-density installations where space is limited.
And the list goes on and on.
Jumpers can be purchased or made to connect between different styles of
connectors. Keep in mind that the micron size of the fiber matters, so make
sure to use the correct size cable for your equipment and cable system.
Even good splices and terminations in fiber cause some signal loss. When
splices and terminations are done improperly, a very large amount of signal
strength can be lost. Splice cables with the fiber nose-to-nose with the next
fiber. Any offsets or angles cause major signal quality issues. You may want to
hire an experienced fiber technician to do your terminations, and have the
technician use test equipment to verify a quality installation.
Hooking up to the ONT
The optical network terminal (ONT) serves as a signal modulator/converter
that changes light impulses from infrared light waves to the electrical impulses
needed by your home electronic equipment. The ONT needs to be connected
to house electrical power. If it loses power, you won’t have phone service or
access to 911 emergency services; when the ONT has lost its power, you lose
your phone’s dial tone. Most ONTs have built-in battery backups, and you may
want to enhance this capability, as discussed in Chapter 15.
141
Chapter 8: Installing Cable TV and Advanced Digital Services

Although the phone company handles cabling to the ONT, wiring on the cus-
tomer side of the ONT is typically the homeowner’s responsibility. A typical
ONT has connections for up to three service types:
 Phone service: A typical ONT has four voice ports for connecting up to
four phone lines. If your home is already wired for phones, simply run
jumper cables from these lines to your phone system’s distribution
point.
 Video (TV) service: The ONT also has a port for video signal output.
Some fiber optic service providers offer video-on-demand, pay-per-view,
and cable channels much like those offered by conventional TV cable
companies. If you move your video services to fiber optics, simply con-
nect a jumper cable from the ONT to your central cable distribution
block.
 Internet service: If your fiber optic provider offers Internet service, the
ONT will have an RJ-45 Ethernet jack to connect to the router or switch
for your home network (or you can connect to a single computer, if you
don’t have a home network yet).
Checking availability
Information technology providers face a daunting task replacing existing
copper wires with fiber optics. Replacing the so-called “last mile” of copper
wire to all homes will likely take many years. Market forces will drive the
availability of fiber optics, with the larger, denser market areas getting access

When can you expect to see fiber optic services at your front door? This will
take some research on your part, and you might not get a straight answer
from your phone company; they like to reserve their options and hold close
their competitive plans. If you don’t already have a press release or a com-
mitment from a company in your area, expect to wait five years or more
before it reaches your neighborhood. Regrettably, some rural areas may not
see fiber optics for ten years or more.
Regardless of how long you have to wait, the well-wired digital home will be
ready to adapt to fiber optics when they arrive. Once your home is wired or
prepared for fiber optics, the waiting game begins. Fortunately, when that
wait is over, you’ll be ready!

W
hen it comes to audio quality, there’s nothing like being at a live con-
cert (or having a troubadour and his troupe perform in your living
room). The sounds of the live performance envelope the space around you,
and you feel the performance as much as hear it.
You may not be able to exactly reproduce the live music experience at home,
but bringing the best audio texture available into your house is simply a
matter of selecting and properly installing quality audio components. There’s
more to setting up a high-quality audio system than connecting a couple of
speakers to a receiver; this chapter takes the mystery out of home audio sys-
tems and shows you how to easily install quality audio in your home. We help
you select, wire, and install basic audio components, and we discuss the vari-
ous options for installing and enjoying stereo and surround sound in one or
more rooms of your home.
Considering Whole-House Sound Systems
Have you ever said to yourself, “Self, I wish we could listen to classical violin
music while we are dining?” With some careful planning and installation, you
can. Your whole-house sound system may be comprised of a monophonic
sound in some rooms, stereophonic sound in others, and full surround sound
in special locations. (See the sidebar “The development of modern sound
reproduction” for information about different sound types.)

As you decide what, if any, sound systems are appropriate for each room, you
may be concerned about the cost of wiring. But whole home audio wiring is a
far better investment than duplicating expensive equipment in many rooms.
By putting your entire equipment budget towards a single system, your lis-
tening experience is less likely to be compromised from poor sound quality
emanating from many pieces of cheap equipment. High-quality receivers and
media players are expensive, but audio wire and quality speakers are rela-
tively inexpensive. By wiring each room from a single high-end audio system,

The development of modern sound reproduction
In the early days soon after Thomas Edison
developed audio recording, all sound repro-
duction was heard through a single speaker
system. A single-speaker system — still
common, particularly on small portable 
radios — is called monophonic sound.
The next major advancement in sound repro-
duction was stereophonic sound, which uses
two speakers to provide two channel sound
recordings. The first stereo recording was made
in 1932. It provides a listening experience simi-
lar to a live band. With a stereophonic recording
you may hear the violin coming from one side
and the bass from the other. Stereophonic
sound is recorded using two microphones. In
the example here, the violin would be recorded
near one of the microphones, and the bass near
the other microphone. A singer may stand
somewhere in the middle so that her voice is
recorded on both audio tracks. By mixing the
two audio tracks, the listener enjoys an audio
experience more closely resembling a live 
performance.
In trying to improve on stereophonic sound,
audio engineers created the next generation of
sound recording, called quadraphonic sound.
Quadraphonic sound offers four separate chan-
nels compared to stereo’s measly two. This was
an improvement, but quadraphonic playback
equipment was expensive and cumbersome.
Another drawback was that the listener had to
be near the convergent center of the four-
speaker axis to appreciate the effect.
Next came Dolby Digital surround sound. This
innovative process imposed two coded signals
on each of the two tracks in a stereophonic
system. The signals are decoded by a sound
processor and distributed to speakers on the lis-
tener’s front right, front left, front center, rear
left, and rear right. A low-frequency channel
handles bass sounds. The main sounds are
channeled to the right- and left-front speakers.
A singer’s voice or dialogue is heard from the
center channel. Background sounds are sent to
the rear channels. The benefits of surround
sound include the ambiance and effects it pro-
duces when routed to properly located speak-
ers. Surround systems produce a much more
realistic feel, and a deeper connection with the
music you hear and the video you watch. In
high-action movies, for instance, surround
sound puts the viewer right in the middle of the
action.

you can leverage the value and performance of your investments. This also
streamlines your home because you don’t need unsightly radios and audio
equipment in every single room.
Using monophonic sound
Monophonic (single channel) sound is normally used by low-fidelity equip-
ment like AM clock radios, low-end televisions, intercoms, weather alert
radios, and telephones. These devices should be the only single-channel
audio devices in the modern digital home. We’ll make an exception for the old
phonograph that played Uncle Benny’s classical 78 rpm records, but beyond
that, consider mono sound outdated. We cover phone wiring in Chapter 6
and intercoms in Chapter 7. Most of your other audio installations will be
stereo or surround systems.
Enhancing audio with stereo sound
In Chapter 7 we show you how to integrate home audio systems into your
intercom system. An integrated system provides a common distribution for
multiple audio sources, but only if you select a multi-zone, multi-source
amplifier system. You can’t listen to a CD using the intercom speakers in one
room while listening to an FM radio station over the intercom in another
room if you have a single-channel (source) intercom system. To bring a mix of
listening choices into a room you must install a multi-zone, multi-source
sound system.
Selecting stereo speaker locations
With all this talk about surround sound, you might wonder why anyone
would settle for plain old stereo sound. Stereo sound is still very pleasing to
the ear, even if you have experienced surround sound. The separation of
sounds is more pronounced in stereo than in surround, and stereo is much
less expensive. While you may want to install surround sound in home the-
ater rooms, most other locations inside and outside the house are good can-
didates for stereo.
To get good stereo sound, the speakers have to be widely separated. Follow
these tips when installing stereo speakers:
145
Chapter 9: Adding Stereo and Surround Sound

 Place the speakers at least 6–8' apart.
 Avoid placing the sides or backs of speakers too close to walls.
 The speakers should be equidistant from the room’s side walls.
 The speakers should be in front of you, and you should be on the center
line between the two speakers.
Visualize an equilateral triangle with speakers at two of the corners and
the listener at the third. This gives the listener the proper spatial aware-
ness provided by the stereo sound tracks. Figure 9-1 shows how speaker
separation and distance create a best listening zone for stereo sound.
Encompassing your listeners 
with surround sound
Surround sound re-creates a 360-degree field of sound by decoding audio 
signals recorded on two tracks. The system splits the sound to multiple
speaker locations to coincide with the approximate locations of microphones
(whether real or virtual) when the sound tracks were originally recorded.
Table 9-1 lists the speakers included in the common types of surround sound
systems.

Choosing surround sound equipment
The surround sound equipment you get to pick out is listed here:
 Sound processor (also called the receiver)
 Front, side, and rear speakers with enclosures
 Bass woofer
Selecting surround sound equipment can be a challenge because of so many
choices. We recommend not using price as your only measure of quality. Pay
attention to basic features:
 Frequency range of the amplifiers and speakers
 Number of sound source input jacks available
 Power output in watts
 5.1, 6.1, or 7.1 output options
147
Chapter 9: Adding Stereo and Surround Sound

A smaller room doesn’t need 200 watts of power, but a larger room might. If
you pay attention to your requirements and purchase a unit that matches
your needs, it doesn’t have to be expensive. If you have extra money in your
budget, buy the best speakers you can afford because these components
actually deliver the sound waves.
An easy way to choose surround sound equipment is to buy a prepackaged
set of speakers and the processor from a single manufacturer — an integrated
system. Most vendors call the surround processor a receiver. An integrated
surround system costs from $200–$7,000. A sound-processor preamp with
separate amplifiers costs about ten times as much as an integrated system.
The more expensive equipment is supposed to be of higher quality, but this
isn’t always the case. The cost difference is mainly due to the fact that the
integrated systems are mass produced. Whatever your budget, consider the
following when choosing a surround sound processor:
 Your surround system should have at least 100 watts per channel of
output power, even though you may only use half of those watts. A pow-
erful amp means less distortion and better sound quality, even at lower
volume settings.
 If you need a lot of power, a preamp system is required. Special effects
sounds are richer and have a bigger impact if the preamp has the power
to drive them through the speakers.
 If the processor you’re looking at doesn’t have Dolby Digital surround
sound, consider another brand. Another, less common, surround proces-
sor format is Digital Theater Systems (DTS). Some processors can handle
both Dolby Digital and DTS.
 Some processors have built-in DVD players. This helps reduce wiring
clutter and simplifies installation.
 Your processor should have these things:
• Input jacks for every piece of electronic sound equipment you own
or expect to own in the future.
• At least six separate jack sets.
• Analog sound channel inputs for CD, DVD, and VCR.
• Digital sound inputs for CD and DVD.
 Select a processor with a remote that incorporates all the features you
want. At a minimum, the surround processor’s remote should include
controls that allow you to adjust the various speaker levels while seated
148
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

in typical listening locations. Some remotes can be programmed to con-
trol other devices such as DVD players and TVs.
 The processor must have standard output jacks for connecting the six
speaker locations listed in Table 9-1 for full 5.1 sound. You have to com-
pare what’s available and what you want to pay for. Some units may
have a special pair of jacks that allow you to connect only two speakers
instead of six. The unit will mix all tracks on the sound to these two
speakers and create the illusion that you have the full compliment of
surround speakers. This isn’t as good as real surround sound, but it’s
certainly a viable option if you have limited space or a limited budget.
You may want to match the type of jack used for wired-in speakers with the
jack or connector on the sound processor. Both ends of your patch cord
needn’t be the same, but it usually makes installation easier. Matching or not,
you can still make up your own patch cords, although buying pre-made patch
cords is often easier and cheaper.
Arranging your surround sound speakers
Surround sound is recommended for places where you watch movies and TV.
This may include a living room, family room, game or recreation room, home
theater, master bedroom, or even some outdoor spaces.
Very small rooms aren’t good candidates for surround sound because the
walls reverberate the sound waves, thus detracting from the sound quality.
The ideal room is fairly wide, because more of your audience is within the
optimum listening zone. Drapes and carpeting can reduce echo and excessive
vibration.
After deciding on rooms, it’s time to lay out those rooms for the optimum lis-
tening experience. Choose from three different speaker layouts:
 5.1 channel: This layout includes right front, left front, center, right sur-
round, left surround, and subwoofer speakers. Figures 9-2 and 9-3 in this
chapter show a 5.1 channel arrangement. Figure 9-3 shows the proper
angular arrangement.
 6.1 channel: This layout includes right front, left front, center, right sur-
round, left surround, center rear, and subwoofer speakers.
 7.1 channel: This layout includes right front, left front, center, right 
surround, left surround, right rear, left rear, and subwoofer speakers.
Figure 9-4 (later in this chapter) shows a 7.1 channel speaker arrange-
ment. This is the ideal surround sound layout.
149
Chapter 9: Adding Stereo and Surround Sound

When shopping for speakers you can mix and match brands or enclosure
styles to some degree as long as the opposing pairs are the same. Don’t devi-
ate from the minimum frequency response in Table 9-1 and do make sure 
the maximum wattage rating matches the rated capacity of your receiver
(amplifier). Typical mass market sound processor/receivers will be within the
ranges shown in the following list. If you aren’t buying a prepackaged system,
purchase the receiver first and, when equipped with the wattage rating, begin
your quest for the perfect speakers and enclosure styles to match your
décor.
 Left- and right-front channels may range in power from 40–130 watts.
 The center channel is typically 40–100 watts.
 The rears are 40–100 watts.
 The powered subwoofer is 50–250 watts.
Except for the subwoofer, each speaker should have exactly the same power
rating, whatever wattage you choose. A speaker set like this typically costs
between $700 and $1,500. We describe speakers and their proper layout in
greater detail later in this chapter.
Figure 9-2 shows a basic 5.1 channel surround sound speaker layout that you
might find in many homes, placed about without full regard to the proper
angular placement for the maximum quality sound reproduction. When
choosing the precise location for each speaker, follow the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard shown in Figure 9-3. Most recording
engineers set up their recording microphones this way, so if your speakers
follow the same layout you should be hearing the sound exactly as it was
originally recorded. The ITU standard specifies angles for each surround
speaker relative to the listener. The listener is directly in front of the center
speaker, with the left and right front speakers 30 degrees to either side, and
the surround speakers 110 degrees to either side.
If you have trouble measuring or calculating angles, place an enlarged photo-
copy of Figure 9-3 in the center of your room and pull strings tight over the
lines to each speaker location.
Depending on the recording’s mix, the center speaker can often be omitted.
The voice coming from the left-front and right-front speakers can create a
phantom center speaker just as in stereo, so long as you’re centered between
the speakers. If you’re too close to the right or left speaker, the sound will
seem to come from that source and not from the central video image, as it
150
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

should. Some surround processors allow you to mix the front-center sur-
round track to the left- and right-front speakers if necessary. You should also
spend some time adjusting speaker levels to accommodate your room’s
shape and size. The processor’s instruction manual should detail how to fine-
tune speaker levels, as well as give recommendations for different room
shapes and sizes.
Height is another important consideration when selecting speaker locations.
The front speakers should be at sitting ear level or a little higher, which is
usually about 4' above the finished floor. The surround speakers should be
higher than the front speakers, usually 5'–7' above the floor. Mounting too
high or too low interferes with how the sound waves travel within a room.
The LFE or subwoofer can be mounted low or right at floor level.
If the speakers wind up in a walking area, watch out for knee-bump hazards.
Also, items placed just above a person’s eye level are in the head-clunk zone.
Place a bookcase or other piece of furniture below the speaker, or hang deco-
rative items near speakers at eye level to avoid collisions and headaches.

Chapter 9: Adding Stereo and Surround Sound

Configuring 7.1 channel surround speakers
Most surround sound systems are based on 5.1 channel technology. Newer
systems are designed for 6.1 and 7.1 channels instead. Currently, most audio
is recorded for 5.1 channel surround sound, although 5.1 recordings still
sound great on 6.1 and 7.1 systems. 6.1 and 7.1 channel recordings are likely
to become more common in the future.
Figure 9-4 shows a 7.1 channel speaker layout. The front speakers are in the
same position as in a 5.1 channel system, but the left and right speakers are
100 degrees from the center, instead of 110 degrees. It may be difficult to posi-
tion the speakers at exactly 100 degrees, so try for somewhere between 90
and 110 degrees. 7.1 channel surround adds two rear speakers, which are
placed 130–150 degrees from the center speaker.
We recommend you wire for the 7.1 format with seven separate speaker loca-
tions, plus the subwoofer. Do this even if you’re buying a 5.1 or 6.1 processor.
You can omit the rear or side surround speakers on the 7.1 system to use a
5.1 layout, or you can use one or both rear speakers with a 6.1 processor.
When you upgrade to a 7.1 processor, you’ll have all the necessary wiring
already in place.

Choosing and Installing Speakers
To enjoy stereo sound in more than one room, you should select a multi-
zone, multi-source, multi-room controller/amplifier such as those sold under
the SpeakerCraft label. The secret that makes these units work: multiple
amplifiers. Multi-room amplifiers that can distribute four input sources to any
of six rooms begin at about $1,000, and if you want support for more rooms
and sources, the cost can reach $5,000. Some systems include options such
as a communications interface to your home Ethernet network, allowing you
to control the system with computers.

Chapter 9: Adding Stereo and Surround Sound

When selecting a multi-channel amplifier/controller, try to choose one that
produces at least 20 watts per channel (or better, at least 30 watts per chan-
nel). This ensures that the reproduced stereo sounds can be heard reason-
ably well and without distortion, even in larger rooms. Going way over 30
watts is unnecessary in most cases.
Listening to music or movies at too-high volumes can permanently damage
your hearing.
Wiring multi-room systems
Wiring your rooms for audio speakers and controls is fairly straightforward.
When running any wire, follow the basic rough-in tips we detail in Chapter 3.
Of course, audio wiring has some special considerations, especially when
you’re setting up a multi-room, multi-source system:
 Install a two-gang box for the controls in each room. You could use a
single-gang box, but we don’t recommend it because the combination of
advanced numeric keypad controls, infrared (IR) remote receivers, and
manual controls would require a two-gang box. Even if your current
plans only call for a single-gang control, blank covers are inexpensive
and the two-gang box makes future upgrades easier.
 Wire the control panels with Cat 5 or preferably Cat 6 cable.
 Each room also needs a pair of two-wire speaker cables, with the wire
sized to match the amplifier. Usually speaker cable is 12 AWG stranded
wire or smaller. Make sure the wire is approved for in-wall use. See 
Table 9-2 for determining the minimum wire size you need.
 Select speakers that match your performance and design goals for the
room. Speakers may be designed to mount on the ceiling or wall, or they
may be in-wall or in-ceiling speakers.
 When using in-wall speakers on a wall shared with other living spaces,
you may need to add sound insulation between the rooms. Otherwise,
volume wars between the occupants may result.
Choose the correct speaker wire gauge from Table 9-2 based on the run dis-
tances you have to make. This table shows the maximum distance in feet to
maintain <.5dB sound signal loss using AWG stranded copper wire for 8-ohm
speakers and 4-ohm speakers. Measure the longest speaker run you will make
and buy that wire size in bulk for all the runs to save money and simplify the
installation.

Choosing speakers
If you’re installing a 5.1 channel surround sound system, you need five regu-
lar speakers plus a subwoofer. If you’re going to install 7.1 channel surround,
add two more speakers to your shopping list.
All of the speakers you buy should have good frequency response. Some
manufacturers give the numbers, and others just advertise full frequency
range. Try to select speakers that have a frequency response ranging from
three cycles per second (CPS) up to 20,000 CPS. This specification is also com-
monly stated as 3 Hz–20 KHz; it means the same thing.
You can do without the subwoofer until it fits within your budget. When you
do buy a subwoofer, choose one with a 3–120-cycle frequency output rating
for low frequency effects (LFE). The lower frequencies just shake the house
and the ground. The frequency at which a human can first perceive sound is
usually more than 15–20 CPS. However, you can feel the vibrations from
sounds as low as 3 CPS, even if you can’t hear them.
Wiring in the speakers
Ideally, speakers should be hardwired into the walls. This is far less cluttered
than running wires along the floor to freestanding portable speakers. When
you put speaker wiring in the walls, install a separate run of 14 or 16 AWG
155
Chapter 9: Adding Stereo and Surround Sound

speaker wire to each speaker location. The wire should be rated for in-wall
use and have a UL rating of CL3. You can use this speaker wire for exposed
wiring, but the wiring is unsightly.
To wire in the speakers, follow these steps:
1. Determine the sound processor’s (receiver’s) location and install an
electrical box to facilitate the wiring connections.
The speakers for your home theater system should be wired to an elec-
trical box (usually a two-gang box) located behind the sound processor.
The electrical box is covered with a home-theater wall plate, which
allows easy connections to the sound processor and any freestanding
speakers. Use patch cords between the wall plate and the sound proces-
sor. The patch cords may connect using banana jacks, binding posts
with fork terminals, or spring clips and bare wires. All of your input
sources — TVs, VCRs, DVD players, and so on — are also connected to
the sound processor using jumper cords and RCA jacks.
2. Run speaker wire from the processor or amplifier junction box to
each speaker location.
Follow the general roughing-in tips described in Chapter 3. Remember,
the speaker wire should be 12, 14, 16, or 18 AWG depending on the dis-
tance of the run.
3. Install a single-gang junction box or LV ring at each speaker location.
If you wish, to get a neater installation you just bring the wire out
through the wall and connect it directly to the speaker without using a
box or LV ring. You can use an electrical crimp sleeve or some other
flanged fitting as eyelets to trim out the wall. Make a hole in the wall
finish with a tapered punch so that the sleeve fits tightly in the wall.
Bring a few inches of wire out through the sleeve and tie it in a knot to
prevent it from falling into the wall.
Try to mount the speaker over the hole and bring the wire out through
the speaker-mounting flange. If the mount provided with your speakers
has no hole, carefully drill one yourself. During the rough in, leave two
feet or more of slack in the wire to reach the speaker.
4. If necessary, nail a block to the nearby studs to provide a backing
behind the drywall to which the speaker is mounted.
This is necessary for any wall- or ceiling-mounted speakers that aren’t
mounted directly on a stud. Supporting speakers with only the strength
of the drywall is not a good idea. The drywall can be torn if something
hits the speakers and the speakers will vibrate if not mounted securely.
156
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

5. Connect the speaker wires to the speakers.
Pay special attention to polarity when connecting speaker wires. The
speaker diaphragm moves out as positive voltage is applied to the voice
coil, and it moves in when negative voltage is applied. The polarity of
the voltage determines which direction the diaphragm moves. For accu-
rate sound reproduction, all speaker diaphragms must move in the same
direction at the same time. The speakers will still produce sound if con-
nected backwards, but the sound waves will not be properly synchro-
nized with the other speakers.
6. Turn your system on and play your favorite CD or DVD to test your
installation.
When connecting speakers, high-quality components are advantageous. Gold
connectors are highly resistant to corrosion, for example. When wiring your
surround sound room, if you can buy 12 AWG wire with gold connectors with-
out breaking the bank, by all means use them; but don’t feel like you have to
beg your mother-in-law for a loan just to buy better speaker wires.
The DC resistance of 1,000' of 18, 16, 14, and 12 AWG wire is 8, 5, 3, and 2 ohms,
respectively. You will probably use less than 100' for any single speaker run in
your home, so the resistances at 100' are all less than 1 ohm. The DC resis-
tance of an ordinary plated connector compared to a gold-plated connector
is so insignificant as to be negligible. The resistance of copper is 1.7 × 10–8
(.000000017) ohms per meter, and gold is 2.24 × 10–8 ohms per meter. Before
the connector is gold plated it usually is plated with nickel. Nickel has a resis-
tance of 7 × 10–8 ohms per meter, which is about four times that of copper. We
don’t believe the human ear can tell the difference between a surround sound
system wired with 16 AWG wire and plated connectors and that wired with 
12 AWG wire and more expensive gold connectors.

Your home isn’t just a place to eat, bathe, and sleep. The modern digital
home is also a place to entertain and be entertained, whether you’re
enjoying some time alone or with friends. Other chapters of this book focus
on specific home systems like intercoms, electricity, cable TV, and computer
networks. We show you how to select and install safe, correctly working
components.
In this chapter we help you focus on the bigger design picture, bringing vari-
ous elements and systems together to create the perfect entertainment
space. Here we bring the basic building blocks together to create a multi-use
family room, or a custom digital odeum of your own.
Designing for Adaptable Family Rooms
The definition of family room varies considerably from one family to the next,
but they all have one thing in common: They’re where family and friends come
together, enjoy each others’ company, play, and relax. This means that your
family room should be versatile enough to adapt to a variety of uses, including
 Play room, where people of all ages play games.
 Theater, where you spend a night watching movies in your own high-tech
theater.

 Work place for those family members with work-at-home jobs or home-
work. Their work or school life all too often extends into the family room.
 Meeting room, a natural place to get together and discuss important
topics.
 Spillover space for extra dining or sleeping space, or a special project
room.
You can probably think of even more uses. Given the need for adaptability,
you must carefully plan wiring and other digital systems in the family room.
Start simply:
1. List all the activities you think will occur there, paying no attention to
how often or how long the activity will occur.
2. Rank the items from most to least important.
3. Write down what systems are needed for each activity and the
number of power outlets required for the activity.
For example, if you plan on having a computer in the family room, you
need a communications jack (Ethernet if you have a home network
and/or broadband Internet connection, or a telephone jack if you have a
dial-up Internet connection). Regarding the outlets: In the activities listed
in Table 10-1, sewing requires work-level lighting, while TV viewing needs
low-level lighting, cable TV jacks, multiple electrical outlets, and possibly
a surround sound system. (The following section explains lighting.) Your
list should have as many items as needed to cover all of your family room
activities.
4. Plan your switch wiring, lighting, power outlets, and communications
jacks.

walls, emerging at the wall mounts for the speakers. See Chapter 9 for more about wiring for sur-
round sound.
Lighting Your Family Room
Lighting levels and switch locations are important design considerations for
any family room. Some types of lighting, such as fluorescent with plastic
lenses, will reflect on TV or computer screens, creating unwanted glare. To
prevent glare you must ensure that there is not a direct line of sight from a
light to TV or computer screen.
To check your lighting geometry in relation to the TV screen when you’re about
to install the light fixtures, place a mirror where the TV screen will be. Position
yourself in the viewing area. If you can see any lights in the mirror, they will
cause glare on the screen. Move the light to change the angle. The same also
goes for natural light sources that aren’t covered by dark shades. Any natural
light (doors or windows) you can see in the mirror will cause screen glare, and
you can’t move natural light sources. Drapes or shades come to the rescue if
you can’t move the TV to compensate for light entering windows.
Low-mounted wall lights are less likely to cause glare. These lights often have
hoods or louvers to direct light down. When installing these fixtures, make
sure they don’t illuminate the wall below them so brightly that they cause
reflections on the TV screen. Paradoxically, the closer you move a fixture to
the TV screen, the less likely it is to cause reflection and glare. Of course, if
the light is too far forward it will be more directly offensive to the viewer.
With a little planning, your family room lighting can be nearly perfect. To be
totally perfect, light bulbs would need to replace themselves when they burn
out. Maybe that level of perfection isn’t possible, but you can come close.
The following sections guide you through selecting some of the types of light-
ing systems you may use in your family room.
161
Chapter 10: Wiring Family Rooms and Home Theaters

Measuring light levels
Different family room activities demand different levels of light. You may
think of light in simple terms of dim, medium, and bright, but you can more
precisely measure and express light levels. The four main units of measure
used in home lighting are
 Candle power: Light intensity produced by one candle.
 Footcandle: Light intensity measured on a surface exactly 1' away from a
burning candle.
 Lumen: 1 footcandle of light intensity on 1 square foot.
 Lux: Light’s metric measure. A lux is equal to 1 lumen per square meter
or 0.0929 footcandle.
The amount of light you need varies by task. (People who have a hard time
seeing may need stronger lighting than given in the following table.)
Task
Light Requirement (in footcandles)
Cleaning a room
25–50
Close-up work
100–200
Lighting a hallway
5
Lighting the driveway
1
Lighting fixture manufacturers provide tables to help you calculate the light
intensity you get by putting its fixtures in a given pattern (and at a deter-
mined mounting height with the recommended bulb or lamp). Light also can
be measured with a light meter.
Figure 10-1 shows sample layouts of two 20' × 20' rooms.
 The room on the left: Four 2' × 4' fluorescent fixtures with parabolic
lenses, as shown in Figure 10-2. These lights give the room 61 footcandles
and use 1.5 watts per square foot — more than twice the lighting, while
using a little less energy, than the recessed lights.
 The room on the right: Nine recessed lights with black baffles and 75-watt
lamps. (The fixture shown on the left in Figure 10-3 has a white baffle.)
This layout yields 25 footcandles of light and uses 1.69 watts per square
foot.
We may call a fluorescent light component a parabolic lens, but it’s not a lens
in the usual sense — just a 11⁄2" × 11⁄2" array of squares. You can see the lamps
if you look up from below the fixture, but the light seems to disappear as you
move away. The silver or gold finished vertical grid hides the lamps when
viewed at an angle and because they’re at a right angle to the lamps, they
pick up very little light unless the finish is degraded or dirty.
162
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Selecting fluorescent fixtures
Some fluorescent fixtures work better than others in family rooms. As
mentioned in the previous section, some fluorescent lights with lenses
can cause glare on TVs and computer screens. However, 2' × 2' or 2' × 4'
recessed fixtures with parabolic louver lenses like the one shown in Figure
10-2 cause little screen glare. Viewed from a short distance these fixtures
just about disappear in the ceiling. You can certainly tell that the lights are
on because the room is illuminated, but you can’t see where the light is
coming from.
Parabolic louvered lenses are made in various grid patterns. We recommend
a 11⁄2" square pattern that is 1" deep. The other patterns don’t hide the light
as well. Other advantages of fluorescent fixtures with parabolic louvered
lenses include
 Low maintenance: Grid pattern lenses can’t catch flies or other debris
like ordinary fluorescent lenses.
 Long service life: Fluorescent lamps last 20,000 hours compared to
incandescent lamps’ 2,000 hours. The ballasts in fluorescent lamps fail
sometimes, but typically last 15 years even with frequent use.
 Low heat: Fluorescent lamps use less electricity and produce less heat
than incandescent lamps.

You can install parabolic lens fixtures in any area. Clean the lenses periodi-
cally. When installed in kitchens, you have to replace the lenses after about
ten years because residue from cooking — maybe one too many burnt
pizzas? — degrades the lens’ silver finish.
Using recessed fixtures
Recessed fixtures are popular choices for family room lighting. As the name
implies, recessed lighting fixtures are flush with the ceiling. Recessed fixtures
are for general area lighting and their placement is important because you
need to install enough fixtures to give adequate lighting. Some things to pay
attention to when installing recessed fixtures include
 TV screen and computer screen glare: Move the lamp as high in the fix-
ture as possible on adjustable fixtures.
 Side reflection: Choose fixture trims with black stepped baffles, or paint
light-colored fixtures black.

Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

 Electrical connections: Make sure they’re good. It is a real inconve-
nience to have to access the junction boxes for recessed fixtures once
the finish is in place.
 Testing: Install temporary lamps and test the fixtures after roughing
them in to make sure everything works. Leave the temporary lamps in
place for lighting during construction.
 Fixtures: Buy recessed fixtures (often called cans) with factory-installed
junction boxes that are wired to the lamp holders with high temperature
wire.
 Lifetime: Recessed fluorescent fixtures use less electricity and the bulbs
last up to ten times longer than incandescent lamps, but recessed fluo-
rescent fixtures are expensive.
 IC rated: If you’re installing recessed lights in a ceiling that is to be insu-
lated, make sure the fixtures are IC rated, meaning they’re rated for
direct contact with insulation.
Overhead lights are often controlled with dimmer switches. When dimmers
are installed on incandescent fixtures, lamp life can be greatly extended,
especially when the lamps are operated at low levels.
Figure 10-3 shows two IC-rated, recessed light fixture cans. Notice that the
junction boxes are connected to the lamp holder housings with flexible con-
duit. Shown in the foreground on the left is the junction box’s metal cover. In
the flex conduit are the black and white wires that connect to the lamp holder.
This wire is rated to withstand temperatures up to 150 degrees Celsius.
The trim on the right in Figure 10-3 is recessed light eyeball trim. The eye-
ball’s gimbal allows you to aim the lamp, which is particularly handy for
accenting a fireplace mantle or wall hanging. You also need the gimbal to
properly aim the light when installing recessed fixtures on sloped ceilings.
This trim takes an R-30 lamp. (The R stands for reflector and 30 is the diame-
ter in 1⁄8"; the lamp is 33⁄4"). This 1⁄8" numbering system indicates the diameter
of most lamps. The telescoping mounting straps are designed to be nailed to
the framing or fastened to a suspended ceiling T-bar grill.
The wire running from the top of the recessed fixture can to the junction box
must be 150 degrees Celsius-rated wire, not 90 degrees Celsius-rated Romex.
The best way to ensure the right rating is to purchase and install a fixture
that has the junction box and high temperature wire already in place. The
junction box must be accessible by code. The box in Figure 10-3 is accessible
after installation by removing three screws that hold the can to the mounting
frame.
165
Chapter 10: Wiring Family Rooms and Home Theaters

Using track fixtures
Of the various lighting systems you can use in your family room, track lighting
systems are among the most versatile: You can move the light fixtures along a
track, and most can swivel to provide perfect aiming.
When you install a track, simply run a control wire to one end of the track
location. You can install this wire in a box, or just bring it out through the wall
or ceiling surface. Track lighting manufacturers make fittings to cover box
openings. Other track-light system components, shown in Figure 10-4, include
 Track connectors: These link multiple tracks together. As you can see in
Figure 10-4, these connectors may be straight, angled, or flexible.
 Light fixtures: These twist-lock into the track and can be aimed in
almost any direction.
 Power-feed connectors: These feed power to the track. One of the con-
nectors in Figure 10-4 is shown with the cover removed.

Supplementing with lamps 
and task lighting
You will probably want to augment your family room lighting with some floor
lamps, table lamps, and other task lights in select areas. For example, a
banker’s lamp can help light up a desk, and a flexible-neck halogen light can
illuminate a sewing table. Three-way switched lamps change lighting levels
as needed next to an easy chair for reading, watching TV, or napping away
the afternoon.

Chapter 10: Wiring Family Rooms and Home Theaters

You can control most freestanding lamps locally using their built-in switches,
or you can control them using switched outlets. When controlling lamps
using switched outlets, remember
 X10 controls (see Chapters 4 and 5) can also be used to control lamps
on switched outlets from anywhere.
 Touch-control lamps are handy in some situations, but you can’t control
them with switched outlets. To control touch lamps remotely you need a
really long finger.
 We don’t recommend that you control switched outlets using dimmers
because the voltage from dimmer switches is DC. Home outlets usually
supply AC voltage. Incandescent lamps handle DC voltage just fine, but
sooner or later someone will plug in a piece of electronic equipment to
the outlet. The result will be damage to both the equipment and the
dimmer switch.
Lamps come equipped with 6' cords. These cords are normally 18 AWG wire.
We recommend that lamps only be plugged into 15-amp circuits and not 20-
amp circuits. If the cord becomes fouled or is chewed on (thanks to Fluffy),
it’s far more likely to burn if it’s protected by a 20-amp circuit breaker. On a
15-amp circuit the breaker is more likely to trip.
Avoid using extension cords to plug in lamps; they tend to get left in place
and become permanent wiring. If you can’t avoid using extension cords, use
14 AWG heavy-duty cords to lessen the risk of a damaged cord, which can be
dangerous.
Controlling your family room lights
The best lights in the world don’t do much good if you can’t turn them on.
Because family room lighting must be adaptable to many uses, the switches
must give you more control. The next couple of sections cover some of the
ways to control the lighting in your family room. For additional information on
roughing in and trimming out light controls, see Chapters 3 and 4, respectively.
Dimming light with dimmer switches
Dimmer switches are an excellent way to control light levels of incandescent
lights. With a dimmer switch you can fine-tune light levels by simply moving
the switch a little bit. Dimmer switches are described in greater detail in
Chapter 4.
If you will be dimming more than 500 watts, use a single-gang box for the
dimmer switch. High-capacity dimmer switches have cooling fins to dissipate
heat, and finned dimmers don’t fit well in multiple-gang boxes. Removing a
cooling fin reduces the dimmer’s wattage capacity. You can dim fluorescent
168
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

lights with special dimmers and fixtures, but dimmers aren’t generally a good
option for fluorescent lights in home projects. Dimming fluorescent fixtures
are very expensive.
Adjusting fluorescent levels with dual switching
Fluorescent lights can’t be dimmed by traditional dimmer switches, but you
can still adjust fluorescent light levels somewhat using dual switching, which
controls a single or section of fixtures with more than one switch. Three-,
four-, or six-lamp fluorescent fixtures can be purchased with one, two, or
three ballasts (voltage converter). Each ballast controls one or two of the
lamps, and each ballast is controlled by a separate light switch. Want a little
light? Flip a switch to turn on one set of lamps. Want more light? Flip on
another set of lamps.
Dual switching is inexpensive. In the case of a four-lamp fluorescent fixture
with two ballasts, apply this switching to all of the fixtures in the room and
you have two levels of lighting available:
1. Wire the fixture to two light switches using three-conductor wire.
2. Connect one switch to the black conductor, and the other switch to
the red conductor.
3. At the fixture, connect the black wire to one ballast, and the red wire
to the other.
The white wire is the neutral for both ballasts.
Of course, dual switching is not an option for fixtures that have only one
lamp or ballast. If you have a bunch of single lamp fixtures, connect every
other fixture to one switch, and the remaining fixtures to the second switch.
Planning Family Room Outlets
In areas with a lot of electrical equipment, it’s important to install a sufficient
number of power outlets. That ensures that you can plug each piece of equip-
ment, battery backup, and surge protector strip directly into a wall outlet.
Install outlets in close proximity to where you expect to use electrical
equipment.
We often install quad outlets (two duplex outlets) in the entertainment and
computer areas.
In addition to good outlet density, you also want adequate circuit density. Run
separate circuits to the areas that will have heavy use. This may mean sepa-
rate circuits for the computer area, theater, wet bar, and others. Most of
169
Chapter 10: Wiring Family Rooms and Home Theaters

these uses have low power demands, with the possible exception of the bar.
It may have a refrigerator, dishwasher, trash compactor, and a few plug-in
items like blenders or ice crushers.
To give your family room the flexibility for periodic furniture rearrangements,
install six jack plates (see Chapter 8) on two or three walls in the family
room. These jacks provide connections for phone, Ethernet, RG-6, and fiber
optics. At some point you may need to accommodate multiple computers
and other devices in the family room.
Use a surge protector with your expensive electronic equipment. We recom-
mend installing a whole-house surge protector in your home’s electrical
service panel. Redundant surge protection is perfectly okay. Often, the
additional surge protectors or computer plug-in bars are necessary just to
accommodate the various low-voltage transformer bricks a lot of devices use.
Designing Your Dedicated Home Theater
Once upon a time, the living room was the place where families got together
to play games, visit with friends, read, listen to the radio, or watch TV. Then
American homes started to sprout family rooms, which were used for most of
the same things as living rooms, but in a more casual setting. Today, some
upscale homes now include dedicated home theaters in addition to family
and living rooms. Whether it’s the rising cost of movie tickets, or the afford-
ability of modern high-definition (HD) TVs and surround sound systems, the
home theater is more common and important than ever.
The home theater differs from the multipurpose family room in that its only
purpose is sound and video entertainment. From the room’s overall design,
to mood lighting and the 7.1 digital surround sound system, each element in
a dedicated theater space must complement the others.
From an architectural perspective, the theater room should have six features:
 An unobstructed view of the video display. The video display, whether a
large TV, a flat-panel plasma HDTV, or even a home theater projector,
should be of significant size and scaled to match the room.
 A space 3–5' deep behind the video screen for wiring all the equipment
and making the connections. Ideally, the wall behind the screen is a
common wall with a mechanical room or dedicated closet. You can also
use a shelf unit, but be sure that it’s securely fastened to the wall behind
it to prevent tipping.
170
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

 Overstuffed furniture on an angled floor. This allows unobstructed views
for people seated in the second and subsequent rows. Instead of a sloped
floor, you can mount a flat-panel TV high enough to view from a level floor.
 Very quiet and gentle air conditioning and heating systems with digital
temperature controls.
 A command center for the video equipment, sound, lighting, and
temperature.
 A small refrigerator if the bar or kitchen is far away. You can’t forget
those refreshments!
If your design includes all of these elements, not only will you have a home
theater, but you’ll have all the makings of a modern digital odeum.
Maintaining access to the equipment
One of the biggest mistakes in home theaters is setting up the equipment
such that the connections can’t be checked or changed without pulling out
all the devices. A large closet or custom-built unit that divides the audio and
video equipment and connections from the viewing area solves this problem.
Figure 10-5 shows an ideal layout for a home theater setup. Custom cabinetry
or custom shelving is a good idea, and can make the room more aesthetically
pleasing. Locking pocket doors or other dividers can keep children away
from the equipment.
171
Chapter 10: Wiring Family Rooms and Home Theaters
Designing media rooms
The term media room is often used synony-
mously with home theater. That isn’t wrong, but
we think one essential ingredient separates a
media room from a home theater: a computer.
When we think of media room, we think of an
area used for creatively working with various
kinds of media. Therefore, the media room is as
much a work space as an entertainment space.
In a media room you might
 Burn custom CDs
 Make greeting cards
 Retouch and print pictures
 Make DVDs
When wiring a media room, form follows func-
tion. The room needs wiring for lights, power,
and communications. Counter-height outlets
may not be aesthetically pleasing in a living
room, but in a media room they’re task oriented
and functional. Other helpful features include
lots of storage, large and lengthy work surfaces,
computer desks, and printer shelves.

Including a control center
If your budget and space allow, you may want to include a control center in
your home theater. The control center’s main feature is to provide extensions
for all of the hardwired controls to a common location, including three-way
switches for the lighting and a place for the remote controls for all the audio
and video equipment. Put command center wiring at the end of a seating row
(depending on whether you are right or left handed). The command center
layout shown in Figure 10-5 requires a short wall or cabinetry with a custom-
built control panel at a 45° angle to the person operating the controls.
The command center wiring plan should include
 Wires between the audio/video equipment and the control center
 Remote controls storage space
 An outlet for battery rechargers
 Three- or four-way switch runs to control lighting, or an X10 controller.

Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

Maintaining clear sound zones
The most important feature of the home theater is the audio system. Video
experts know that audiences are relatively forgiving of poor video quality, but
notice even minor audio imperfections. Ideally, your home theater is wired
for 7.1 channel surround sound as described in Chapter 9. When planning the
sound space for your home theater, consider the following:
 Furnishings: Pay close attention to speaker mounting heights to avoid
conflicting with the furniture. Make sure furniture doesn’t block any
speakers.
 Telephone: Do you need a telephone in the theater? Our feeling is that
the theater is the last place you want a phone. However, you may want
to watch a movie with the family while you’re expecting a call from the
boss. The nearly perfect solution is to use a little gadget called a phone
flasher. A phone flasher plugs into a phone jack and an electrical outlet.
You then plug a lamp — any lamp — into the phone flasher. When the
phone rings, a relay in the phone flasher flashes the lamp on and off.
This is much less disturbing than the ringer on the phone.
However, you need to install at least one phone jack in your home the-
ater if you’re going to use pay-per-view or on-demand services that are
initiated by telephone dial-up.
 Wall thickness: In a new construction, exterior walls are often made
with 2" × 6" wall framing leaving a larger cavity for heat/cooling insula-
tion. When designing your theater for new construction, consider using
2" × 6" interior walls (instead of a normal 2" × 4" interior wall) with
sound-deadening insulation to minimize sound travel both into and out
of the room. Remodeling projects are usually limited to having sound
insulation blown into existing wall cavities and using heavier doors on
the room entrance.

M
ost homes built in the last 30-plus years had both electrical and tele-
phone systems installed during construction. And in the last couple of
decades, cable TV systems have become common. What sets a digital home
apart from just a plain old home is that the former has modern systems like
computer networks, multi-zone audio systems, and — you guessed it —
advanced video surveillance systems.
Home video surveillance systems serve a variety of uses. They allow you
to make sure that’s Doug, not some stranger, in the big brown truck with a
delivery. Cameras help you keep an eye on the kids’ playroom, conduct
videoconferencing over the Internet, and share views of your beautiful
sunsets with distant friends. And of course, cameras are an integral part
of a home security system. We describe security systems in greater detail in
Chapter 14. Here we introduce you to the different types of available camera
systems, including webcams and more traditional types. We show how to
integrate video cameras into other home systems, and how to keep the
cameras rolling even when the power goes out.
Selecting Video Components
A smart shopper — that’s you — needs to carefully evaluate the different
types of surveillance systems and cameras. Take the time to consider your
needs before you begin shopping. Walk your home and property with a note
pad, and assess areas where risks might be reduced by surveillance. Use your
notes to help decide what to buy and install. Outdoor areas, for example,

probably need weatherproof cameras with strong low-light performance.
Indoor areas may call for smaller, more discrete cameras. The following
sections help you evaluate the different features.
Reviewing camera features
If you want to install video surveillance, there’s just no getting around the
fact that you’re going to have to buy some video cameras. Cameras range
from very cheap with few features, to more expensive with better perfor-
mance. Different areas of your home call for different types of cameras.
Consider the following:
 Size: Size may be important, particularly when trying to hide a camera.
So-called bullet cameras are intended to peer through small drilled holes,
with the camera remaining hidden.
 Camera resolution: How crisp and clear do you need the picture to be?
Higher-resolution cameras provide clearer pictures with sharper edges.
They’re always better — and almost always more expensive — than 
low-resolution cameras, but budget may limit your choices.
 Operating temperature range: Nearly all electronic devices can be
damaged or temporarily fail when exposed to certain temperatures.
Outdoor cameras can be exposed to high levels of heat, as well as
freezing temperatures. Enclosures with heaters or fans can help keep
cameras within operating temperature ranges.
 Color or black and white: Unless you’re working with a very restricted
budget, you should choose color cameras. They make it much easier to
see what’s happening on the screen.
 Night vision: You may need some cameras (especially outdoor cameras)
to provide a visible image in the dark, without floodlights. If you’re con-
cerned about low-light operation, choose a camera with night vision.
 Weatherproofing: Cameras which will be fully exposed to the elements
must be weatherproof. You can mount cameras behind glass and under
porches to give the camera some protection from the weather and still
get a view outside, but any camera installed outside should be a weath-
erproof model.
 Sun shielding: Cameras that will be mounted in locations that receive
direct sunlight for any part of the day need sunshields, or else all the
camera will record is a bright white spot.
 Tamper-resistant housing: Cameras in high-traffic areas, remote locations,
or other unsecured spots may need a tamper-resistant housing. This fea-
ture doesn’t stop someone who’s truly determined to destroy the camera,
but it prevents repair bills that come from foolish tampering.
176
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

 Domes: Protective domes can potentially protect your cameras from two
things: bad weather and vandalism.
 Motion sensors: A camera equipped with a motion sensor turns on when
someone comes into its field of view. The motion sensor can also trigger
a local or general alarm, or trip a zone on the integrated security alarm.
 Sound: In addition to seeing video, you may want to hear what’s happen-
ing. If so, select a camera with a built-in omnidirectional or directional
microphone (mic). Omnidirectional mics pick up sound equally from all
angles. Directional mics pick up sound within a defined cone-shaped area
depending on what subtype you buy, the latter here picking up the nar-
rowest area; see Figure 11-1:
• Cardiod
• Supercardiod
• Hypercardioid
 Dummy cameras: A camera made for this book? No. A dummy camera is
a fake you install simply to attract attention. Someone sees the dummy
and thinks you have video surveillance, even if you don’t. You also can
install dummies to divert attention away from real cameras.

Chapter 11: Installing Video Systems and Cameras

 Power supply — AC, DC, or both: Cameras need electricity to operate.
If your cameras must operate even when the power goes out, you need a
DC power source for backup power (probably a battery). Remote loca-
tions may be powered with 12-volt DC power and solar cells to keep the
batteries charged. This application is great for solar cells because the
cameras don’t draw much current.
 Remote rotation: You may want to rotate a camera remotely or automat-
ically. Some models let you tilt the camera vertically or pan horizontally.
This may be a handy feature in some cases, but rotating cameras can be
quite expensive and they need additional maintenance.
 Zoom — optical or digital: Zoom allows the camera to focus in close, in
effect magnifying the subject. Digital cameras may offer both digital and
optical zoom, although optical zoom is best because it maintains image
quality. Digital zoom discards some image quality as it gets close to an
image.
 Auto iris: The camera’s auto iris causes the circular hole through which
the camera sees to be larger or smaller, letting in exactly the right
amount of light for a good picture. An auto iris automatically adjusts to
constantly changing light conditions.
Choosing a video surveillance system
The simplest way to choose a surveillance system is to buy a kit containing
all the necessary components:
 Cameras
 Monitor screens
 Video recorders
If you buy all the components in a kit, you greatly increase the chance that
everything will work well together. Even when buying a startup kit you may
have to buy additional wire, connectors, back-up power supplies, and other
accessories. Typical prepackaged kits include four cameras, a video monitor
that can display the inputs from all four cameras, and a recording device, along
with the various controls. If you plan to install additional cameras, make sure
your system’s monitor and control unit can support them.
Surveillance systems — whether purchased in a kit or as separate
components — usually come in one of two formats:
 Closed-circuit TV (CCTV): These usually include analog TV cameras and
a monitor. Analog CCTV systems are less efficient because analog images
are harder to store. You can connect CCTV systems to VCRs or digital
video recorders (DVRs).
178
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

 Web-based cameras: These cameras connect to your home network
wirelessly or via Ethernet cables. The camera’s internal circuitry gener-
ates a Web page containing the current camera image, and you can use
any network computer to view the image using a Web browser. You may
even be able to view the camera’s image over the Internet if you have a
static IP address, as described in Chapter 12. The camera’s Web page
can only show the current image, however; most cameras can’t store
images. You need a file server (usually a network drive) for storing video
streams or pictures. For more on using webcams with a home network,
see Chapter 12.
For the modern digital home we believe that Web-based cameras are the way
to go. Setting them up is easy and increasingly affordable. The biggest advan-
tage to Web-based cameras is that you can connect up to 254 different
devices on one network, each with its own IP address. If the network includes
a file server, a router/gateway, and a PC that uses an IP address, that leaves
you with the potential to install up to 251 cameras. It is hard to imagine that
the average home would need more than 200 cameras, but it’s good to know
that you probably won’t run up against a limit.
Installing Your Video System
How you install your surveillance system depends mainly on your purpose
for installing cameras in the first place. Two primary yet potentially comple-
mentary reasons exist for installing cameras: security or convenience. You
needn’t hide cameras installed primarily for convenience, although you can
anyway. If a security camera is visible, it may deter an intruder. On the other
hand, hiding cameras reduces the possibility of tampering or vandalism.
Consider using the previously mentioned dummy camera left in plain sight
and a hidden camera at the same time.
Positioning cameras
You determine camera placement and aim by carefully analyzing the areas
you want to keep an electronic eye on. Common camera locations include
 Front and back doors
 Walkways
 Porches
 Driveways
 Remote buildings
 Children’s playroom
179
Chapter 11: Installing Video Systems and Cameras

Once you’ve listed general locations, choose specific locations for physical
mounting of the cameras. Each location is unique, but here are some mount-
ing tips:
 Under eaves: Eaves provide some weather protection, and you can usu-
ally mount the cameras on framing members. You may be able to locate
this 2' × 2' lumber by looking where the siding is nailed. Keep in mind,
however, that although eaves provide some weather protection, you
should install weatherproof cameras in outdoor locations.
 Suspended ceilings: To install a camera that peers through a hole or
dome in a suspended ceiling, install a mounting frame above the ceiling
tile. The mounting could be a manufacturer-supplied item available with
the camera or just some lumber that spans and is attached to the ceiling
framing.
 Above eye level: Mounting cameras above a pedestrian’s normal range
of sight usually provides the camera a better view and enhances its
security. Sometimes the field of view you want requires a lower mount-
ing location. In such cases, try to mount the camera in something or oth-
erwise hide it so only the lens end is exposed. You can put a bullet
camera in your mailbox or house number plaque.
 Hidden in plain sight: You can hide a camera by making it look like
something else. For example, you could place a camera inside a thick,
hollowed-out book on a shelf.
 Strong mounting: Make sure the mounting bracket is strong enough to
support the camera. For outdoor cameras, keep in mind that wind and
ice may add extra stress to the mounting.
If your area is prone to burglary and vandalism, install a dummy camera in an
obvious, prominent location. A highly visible camera may discourage theft or
vandalism, and even if someone vandalizes or steals it, you won’t lose an
expensive piece of equipment.
Supplying power to your cameras
Unless you install solar-powered cameras, you need a power source at each
location. Most cameras run from power supplies plugged into conventional
120-volt AC power. Most units are equipped with a weatherproof cord that
you plug into a standard receptacle. If the receptacle isn’t accessible from
grade level (or ground level), you don’t need a Ground Fault Interrupter (GFI),
but you probably need an in-use weatherproof cover. By code, if the recepta-
cle can only be reached via ladder, it isn’t accessible. See Figure 16-1 for an in-
use receptacle cover.
180
Part II: Adding Communication, Audio, and Video Systems 

You may want to have your security system on its own circuit. Keep in mind,
however, that having the security system on a separate circuit is a potential
problem: Unless the system has a battery-powered alarm that sounds when
the power is out, the system can be shut off without you being aware of it.
Connecting cameras to the network
Cameras connect to your home network or surveillance system using a
variety of methods. They may be wireless or use Cat 5, Cat 6, RG-6, or RG-59
cable.
Regardless of the connection type, follow the general rules of wiring when
installing your cameras:
 Any wiring you install must be listed for the environment in which you
install it. For example, wiring for outdoor cameras should be sunlight
resistant, waterproof, and rated for direct burial if necessary.
 Outdoor power receptacles accessible from grade must be GFI protected
and have in-use covers on the boxes.
 Webcams normally use Cat 6 cable to send data to the network server
for your surveillance system. Take extra care to protect the Ethernet
jacks from weather, including using the weather- and water-resistant
connectors discussed in Chapter 17.

f you don’t connect your home to the Internet, your home network is like
an island, helplessly isolated from the online world. That online world
includes a wealth of information, entertainment, online classes, and efficient
means of communication by e-mail or instant messaging. An Internet connec-
tion also allows you to control the devices in your home, communicate with
people in your home, or monitor things when you’re away. Imagine knowing
the thermostat setting or checking the status of sump pumps, heating equip-
ment, and alarm systems in your home from anywhere in the world. Would
you like to be able to turn on a crock pot from the office before you begin
your commute home? All of these things and much more become possible
with a speedy and reliable Internet connection. Once you’re connected to the
Internet, “Get the most from that connection,” should be your mantra.
This chapter provides an overview of home networks and Internet connec-
tions. It shows how to install the modems, network wiring, routers, firewalls,
network hubs, and switches used to connect your computers and other
devices to the Web, and it shows how to select protective devices used for
controlling the family’s browsing experience. We also compare the alternative
connection methods and various features of typical Internet connection
service plans.

Understanding Internet Terminology:
Stirring the Alphabet Soup
A lot of different technologies work together to connect your digital home to
the Internet. These technologies are commonly known by acronyms that may
be new to you. In this section, we decrypt some of these acronyms and the
technologies they represent.
POTS (Plain Old Telephone System)
Preceding the Internet’s development was a worldwide analog communications
system called POTS. This system allowed — still allows, actually — someone in
San Francisco to place a phone call to someone in London simply by dialing the
correct number sequence. The number sequence is an international phone
number composed of numbers conforming to the following format:
[international access code] + [country code] + [city code] + [area code] +
[phone number]
186
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 
What in the world is the Internet, anyway?
The Internet is a worldwide data communica-
tions network that grew out of an earlier network
called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects
Agency Network). This network connected
agencies of the United States Department of
Defense with contractors, educational institu-
tions, and research centers. This early network
facilitated rapid communications between com-
puters using different operating systems.
The ARPANET (and later the Internet) moved
large amounts of data from different computer
hosts by breaking the data into small packets of
data, and then routing those packets over inter-
connected devices. The data was reassembled
on the distant end, regardless of which path the
data packets followed to get there. This com-
munications scheme of using any available
pathway provided reliability because it allowed
connections even when some links were down.
The interconnections looked like a spider’s web,
leading to the nickname World Wide Web. As
more alternative pathways were added, the net-
work’s reliability increased, making it a great
means of communication.

To call the British Broadcasting Corporation in London from the U.S., you
would dial 011-44-08700-100-212. The voice call would be routed using this
number over local and long-distance communications lines and switching
devices to find just the right phone at the London, England-based interna-
tional news and broadcasting service.
IP (Internet Protocol) addresses
Just like a phone number finds a phone or fax machine, the Internet uses
numbers called IP addresses to find other computers or devices connected to
the Web. IP addresses use the pattern n.n.n.n, where n is a number between 0
and 256. A typical IP address might look like 10.245.10.1.
The numbers used in IP addresses are interpreted by computers in binary
format. The largest possible number in an IP address is 28, but they are
always expressed as base-10 numbers in conversation and writing.
Each interconnecting device and computer on the Internet is assigned a
unique IP address. To connect the computers and devices in your home to
the Internet, you must have at least one IP address to handle Internet com-
munications. Usually, your ISP automatically assigns it.
Each computer and device on your home network also has a unique local IP
address. Usually, a device called a router stores the IP addresses of the
devices connected to your home network and facilitates communication
between those devices. We describe routers in greater detail later in this
chapter in the “Installing and configuring a router” section.
DNS (Domain Name Services)
If you need to find someone’s phone number, you can dial directory assis-
tance or open a phone book. The Internet has its own directory assistance
called DNS. This service provides IP addresses to your computer for com-
puter hosts on the Internet. For example, the IP address associated with the
domain name Novell.com is 130.57.4.27.
The beauty of DNS is that it works in the background. When you enter a uni-
form resource locator (URL) such as www.dummies.com into your computer’s
browser, DNS looks up the proper IP address automatically. Your Internet-
connected computer queries the nearest DNS host, and the IP address
associated with the URL is returned to your computer so your request is
routed to the right place.
187
Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol)
DHCP is a tool networked computers use to automatically assign IP addresses
to each computer on the network. On a DHCP-enabled network, a DHCP ser-
vice automatically assigns unique IP addresses to each computer on the net-
work as it boots up and connects. This is sometimes called dynamic
assignment of IP addresses.
Alternatively, you can manually enter and configure the IP address on each
computer (otherwise known as hard coding or assigning a static IP address).
ISPs sometimes offer a choice of connecting your home computers to the
Internet though DHCP dynamic assignment, or by manual assignment of a
static IP address.
The permanent manual assignment of an IP address is more useful because it
also facilitates easy communication to your home devices from external loca-
tions across the Web. When you select an ISP, try to choose one that allows
manually assigned (also called static) IP addresses.
Reviewing Your Internet
Connection Options
An Internet connection not only provides you with access to e-mail, movies,
music, news, and the world’s largest library of information, it also lets you
access the computers and devices in your home from any computer that’s
connected to the Internet. You could be in a coffee shop in Paris, log into a
webcam aimed at your front door, and see who’s come by to visit (or solicit).
But before you can perform any online magic, you need a connection to the
Internet. Start by finding out which communications companies in your area
offer Internet services. These companies are called Internet Service Providers
(ISPs). People living in cities and major metropolitan areas often have many
companies and service plans to choose from. If you live in a more rural area,
your options may be a bit more limited. Not all services are alike in terms of
speed, cost, and quality, so it pays to do some research and find the best value
in your area — compare the features that each service offers and compare the
costs. You may find that a faster cable or digital subscriber line (DSL) service
costs only slightly more per month than a slow, obsolete dial-up service.
The following sections detail all of the possible connection types, some of
which may not be available in your area. Table 12-1 lists the typical service-
plan options. Research which options are available in your area, and then fill
in the prices in Table 12-1 to help find the best value.

Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

Dial-up service
Rural areas are often limited to dial-up connections over POTS lines. The dis-
advantage to dial-up connections is that they don’t provide an always-on con-
nection. To use the connection, your computer must first dial the ISP and
sign in, often a clucky process. Also, and more importantly, dial-up connec-
tions are the slowest of all the Internet connection methods.
ISDN (Integrated Services 
Digital Network)
ISDN service provides you with a faster way to connect to other digital ser-
vices over phone lines. ISDN connections consist of either of these 64 Kbps
(kilobits per second) communications links, both of which are sometimes
called B channels:
 One (single channel)
 Two (dual channel)
To connect your computer to ISDN, an ISDN terminal adapter is installed
between the phone line and the computer. Because ISDN can also handle
analog phone calls, the terminal adapter may include an outlet to plug in a
standard analog phone. You can also connect a fax machine to your ISDN 
service. An advantage to ISDN is that it’s faster than dial-up.
T-1 lines
Major telecommunications companies sometimes offer high-speed Internet
connections over T-1 lines, which provide connection speeds at 1.544 Mbps
(megabits per second). T-1 connections are fast and always on, but they also
tend to be very expensive.
Fractional T-1
Sometimes you can buy fractional T-1 Internet service in 64-Kbps increments,
with an overhead, or loss, of 8 Kbps per each 64KB channel for maintaining
the control signaling between the two devices. A full T-1 data connection can
be divided into 24 channels. (A channel can move 64KB of data per second
across the lines.) You could, for example, contract for fractional T-1 service
at 384 Kbps.
190
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

Broadband cable
Cable modems connect computers to the Internet over TV cable. Cable TV
companies that provide Internet connections may offer speeds as high as 6
Mbps for downloads and 768 Kbps for uploads. Cable modems comply with a
standard called Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS).
Broadband cable connections are always on, and are usually cost effective,
especially for people who already have cable TV service.
DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or ADSL
(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
DSL is a very popular Internet connection method. DSL data signals travel over
POTS and provide an always-on connection. ADSL provides connection speeds
that differ between downloading data and uploading data to the Internet. DSL
works by imposing a signal on the phone wire that differs in frequency from
standard analog voice signals. A filter is installed on each phone in the home
or office to help keep data signal noise from being heard on the analog voice
channel.
One major advantage of DSL over dial-up is that you can use your phone or fax
machine while online. Because DSL runs over POTS, any necessary repairs are
likely to happen rapidly. Phone service is usually a state-regulated utility and
time-to-repair statistics receive some attention from state regulators. This adds
to the overall value proposition of using DSL if it is available to your home.
Fiber optic service
In a few very fortunate areas, some telecommunications companies are offer-
ing fiber optic data and voice services directly to residences. Fiber optic cable
carries signals using light waves instead of electricity. These light waves can
reach very high data-transfer rates and are unaffected by magnetism, line
attenuation (reduced signal strength), noise from power lines, or electrical
storms. Fiber-to-home services are usually more expensive than copper wires,
but the higher speeds compensate for the cost and are hard to resist if avail-
able in your neighborhood.
Options for fiber Internet service speeds can reach 30 Mbps when downloading
from the telecommunications company’s central office with upload speeds of
up to 5 Mbps. Of course, the connection to your phone company is probably a
lot faster than the rest of the Internet, but at least the connection within the
last mile to your house won’t be the slowest link.
191
Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

BPL (Broadband Over Power Lines)
BPL — or Power Line Communications — technology is slowly moving beyond
the testing environment, but because it imposes modulated radio waves into
unshielded electric power lines, it may not take off like some other technolo-
gies previously mentioned in this chapter. There are data security risks and
the potential for interference with other radio receiving and transmitting
devices that plug into the power lines. The best advice is to watch this one
and carefully compare this to other options in your neighborhood as this
type of service evolves.
Amateur HAM radio operators and those providing emergency services are
concerned about the potential for radio frequencies to cause unmanageable
interference with their radio communications. Nearby two-way radio traffic
from those same sources may cause packet losses to occur on the power line
data traffic.
Area wireless services
Wireless Internet services come in two flavors:
 One is transmitted and received over cell phone towers to either a cell
phone or a special wireless modem card on a computer.
 One uses equipment that conforms to the 802.11 wireless networking
standards developed by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical & Electronics
Engineers).
This gear is mainly used for home and business wireless networks, as well as
at Internet hotspots, but some communities are now set up to provide free
or low-cost wireless access, turning whole towns into giant cyber cafés.
Using 802.11 wireless Internet access presents some security and service-
level challenges both for the provider and the end user.
Area wireless services may play a role in your digital home design for sup-
porting backup communications to alarms and providing communications in
the event of a catastrophic failure of your primary connection (sometimes
caused by yellow-bellied fiber-seeking backhoes).
Connecting Your Home Network
to the Internet
After you’ve reviewed the different options available in your area and have
chosen your ISP, you need to get your home connected to the Internet. Your
192
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

ISP will guide you through the steps necessary to get connected. The follow-
ing sections help you set up your computer or home network to take advan-
tage of your new Internet connection.
Installing a DSL or cable modem
Internet service providers do their best to make installing DSL or cable
modems as simple as possible — if you’re only connecting a single computer.
Most ISPs send you an automatic setup disc and basic instructions. If you
have more than one computer or device to connect to the Internet — and
we assume you do since you’re reading this book — you need to connect
the cable or DSL modem to a router or switch as described in the following
sections.
If you get DSL, follow these basic steps, which should also be supplied with
the modem:
1. Install a phone line filter in every phone line in your home, and
then connect your analog telephones to the Phone port on each 
filter.
The ISP should provide phone line filters with the DSL modem, and you
can also buy them at many electronics stores. Every phone line must
have a filter — even lines not used by the DSL modem.
2. Connect the supplied DSL cable between a phone line filter and the
DSL port on your DSL modem, as shown in Figure 12-1.
3. Connect an Ethernet cable between the RJ-45 port on the DSL modem
to your computer’s network interface card (NIC) or to your
router/firewall device.
The ISP probably supplied an Ethernet cable with the modem.
4. Connect the power cord to the DSL modem and plug it into a surge-
protected power source.
Ideally, you should connect the DSL modem to an uninterruptible power
supply (UPS). This prevents connection troubles in the event of a power
surge and brief power outages.
5. Turn on your computer, insert the setup disc, and follow the instruc-
tions provided by the ISP to configure your DSL account.
After your DSL account is configured, disconnect the DSL modem from your
computer and plug the Ethernet cable into a router or switch, as described in
the next section.
193
Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

Installing and configuring a router
The first device between the Internet and your home’s computing devices is
the modem, often provided by the ISP. The second device to install is a
router. A router allows your connection to appear to the ISP as one IP
address, while at the same time connecting up to 254 computers and devices
in your home to the Internet. The router uses DHCP to assign unique, local IP
addresses to each connected device.
When a computer on your home network connects to the Internet, the router
acts as a proxy for the computer’s upstream requests and downstream data.
The router uses a process called network address translation (NAT) to keep
track of the requests and downstream data traffic for each private IP address
on the network.
Most consumer routers also include a firewall. A firewall allows the device to
block (deny) or pass (allow) data packets that meet certain criteria, thereby
protecting your network from unauthorized access. Your Windows computer
operating system has firewall settings built in, and you can load third-party
firewall software to enhance security. Use the firewall setting in the router
Figure 12-1:
View of
typical DSL
modem
connection
ports.
194
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

and computer to complement each other and increase security by setting
them up to work together. The connecting interface of a router/firewall
device is illustrated in Figure 12-2. The router in Figure 12-2 has one uplink
port to connect to the DSL or cable modem via an Ethernet patch cable with
RJ-45 connectors. Additional Ethernet ports are for connecting computers or
additional switches or hubs to the router. (Switches and hubs are described
in the next section.)
After you have successfully configured your first computer to work with your
cable or DSL Internet service, take these steps:
1. Disconnect the Ethernet cable between the modem and your computer.
2. Connect the modem directly to the router’s upstream port.
3. Connect your computer to the router.
Usually, the router manufacturer includes a CD-ROM that walks you through
the installation and configuration process. After the router is installed, you
can manage the router from your computer’s Web browser.
Your first goal is to get reliable high-speed connectivity. You can configure
and refine firewall rules based on your security requirements later.

195
Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

Using firewalls
Most consumer-oriented routers also include built-in firewalls. The firewall pro-
vides a barrier between the devices connected to the network in your home
and the rogue devices and hackers on the Internet intent on harming your sys-
tems. The firewall uses rules that allow or deny network traffic to pass through
based on specific security criteria. The rules generally start with the concept of
“deny all,” and then a list of exceptions is created to allow trusted traffic to
pass through. Having this level of control is particularly valuable when you
want to control children’s access to Internet sites, as discussed in the sidebar,
“Controlling your child’s Internet access,” elsewhere in this chapter.
The fine details of blocking access to the Internet, dangerous e-mail messages,
or specific Web sites are beyond the scope of this book. The instructions and
documentation provided with the router/firewall you choose should provide
further information so you can design custom filters and rules.
Understanding hubs and switches
Ethernet hubs and switches work much like routers in that they store or for-
ward network data traffic from one device or computer to another. But that is
where the similarity ends. If you use a hub to connect your network devices
together, every port on the hub sees all the network data traffic on every
other port. For example, if you have a four-port hub, the signals sent from
your computer are transmitted to each of the three other ports. If the signal
only needs to go to one other computer, broadcasting the signal to all ports
is not a very efficient use of network bandwidth.
Unlike a hub, a switch (shown in Figure 12-3) is intelligent enough to only pass
data to a specific port. Switches also allow additional controls over the net-
work traffic on a per-port basis, and these are referred to as managed ports.
Most consumer routers have built-in unmanaged switches for connecting at
least four computers. Hubs are useful for temporarily connecting more than
one nearby computer to a single network drop. Switches are preferable when
you need dedicated bandwidth for your permanent network.

Preparing to Wire Your Digital 
Home for Networking
You can do a lot of cool things with home networks today, and the possibili-
ties for tomorrow are even greater. To take advantage of these possibilities,
you need to wire your home with network outlets, often called network drops.
Figure 12-4 shows the devices, box, and cover needed for a network drop in
any room. Installing network drops in every room may not seem necessary
right now, but doing it now makes your home ready for whatever tomorrow’s
home networking opportunities may bring.
Our wire-it-now bias may show when we suggest that every room in new con-
struction should have at least two each of the following:
 Phone jacks
 Ethernet network outlets
 Two-pair fiber cables
 TV cable jacks

Wire the elements into electrical boxes or LV rings and connect them to a
central wiring closet, which should be a dedicated space in the basement, a
warm wall in the attached garage (for homes without basements), or other
dedicated space. In addition to these elements, consider whether to run
three additional Cat 5 or 6 cables to each room for audio/sound channels and
intercom systems. The central wiring area should have
 Electrical power outlets that are served by at least two different circuit
breakers in the service panel.
 The same height, access, and clearance requirements spelled out for the
electrical service panel in Chapter 2. Larger rooms (such as a big family
room) or special use areas like home offices may warrant additional net-
work drops.

Controlling your child’s Internet access
One way to think of the Internet is as a library.
While a wealth of information is available, not
all of this information is appropriate for children.
On the other hand, access to information and
technology is critical to the modern educational
process. This dichotomy often finds parents and
guardians conflicted about the best course for
their children.
Remember: Rather than think of an Internet con-
nection as an all-or-nothing choice, realize that
you can likely couple control technology with an
appropriate measure of adult supervision to sat-
isfy your concerns. The technology alone or
supervision alone is probably not enough to
thwart the determined and curious child. Using
both — together — in a thoughtful manner is the
best approach. Several tools are at your disposal:
 Firewall access-time controls: You can
configure your firewall to create rules that
limit the time of day computers in the home
can access the Internet. For example, you
can limit access to the times on weekday
evenings and weekend days when you
expect to be present.
 Firewall URL filtering: Another simple
approach is to create a rule that allows
access only to parent-approved Web sites.
If any other URL is entered in the Web
browser, the firewall blocks the data traffic,
preventing that site from being viewed.
Building specific access lists may be time-
consuming, but it provides the level of con-
trol many parents desire. As your child
earns trust and develops maturity, you can
add sites to the access list.
 Content-filtering software: You can filter
specific kinds of content with products
such as SurfControl or Cyber Patrol. This
approach costs money, but some parents
may consider the undertaking worthwhile.
Content filtering and blocking products can
also protect computers from spyware,
viruses, and worms.

One of the most annoying things we have found in many recently constructed
homes is a wanton disregard for orderly arrangement of services and utilities.
A typical new home basement may have the electrical service coming in on
the northeast corner, the TV cables on the southwest corner, the phone line in
the middle of the north side, the natural gas lines entering from the southwest
corner, the basement sump pump in the southeast corner, the water pressure
tank in the center of the south elevation, the water heater in the northwest
corner, and the furnace in the middle of the basement. All this disarray adds
up to only about 40 square feet of usable floor space remaining in the base-
ment. Perhaps we exaggerate a bit, but all of these elements should be orga-
nized by design, not by each trade doing its own thing. When designing a new
home or remodeling, pay attention to the big picture and try to enforce some
logic, order, and discipline to the placement of services and utilities.
Of course, you need some way to organize and connect all the cables running
into your wiring closet or area. The best way is to invest in a 19" rack and
mount all of the cable runs to patch panels in the rack. Wall-mounted racks
with swing-away hinges make accessing the back punch-down blocks easier.
One layout that’s particularly useful has a hinged patch-panel rack that
swings away from the wall to the left, and an equipment rack or shelf that
swings away to the right, with cable sling hooks on the back wall between
them. It is important to bring all of the cables to the closet, referred to as
home runs. When all the communication cables from every room are brought
to a central point and properly labeled, it adds a professional look to the pro-
ject and makes future changes and expansions easier.
Understanding Wireless “Wiring”
Wireless home networks use radio waves to transmit data, usually over short
distances. In-home wireless devices often connect wireless network interface
cards on computers to wireless-equipped broadband Internet modems. The
advantage of wireless networking equipment is that not every room must be
wired with Ethernet cable to connect to the home network.
Wireless networking devices conform to IEEE standards for wireless devices.
The most popular standards are 802.11b and 802.11g. The main difference
between these two is the speed at which data is transmitted between
devices. The newer standard is 802.11g, and it can transmit data at speeds up
to 54 Mbps. Older, slower 802.11b devices transmit at up to 11 Mbps. Most
802.11g devices are compatible with 802.11b networks.
199
Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

Someone listening or hacking into your network is the major security risk
involved with any wireless device. Do not deploy wireless network equipment
without using all the available security features. Read the manuals for the
wireless equipment and take the time to fully implement the manufacturer’s
security recommendations. Also, we recommend that you only enable wire-
less network devices when needed. An easy way to do this is to plug the wire-
less access point into a switched power outlet and flip the switch off when
you are done.
Setting Up Your Home Network
After you have purchased all your networking equipment and wired in your
network drops, it is time to connect everything and turn your home Ethernet
network into a working system complete with Internet access. The best way
to show the whole system is with a big picture diagram. This section will pre-
sent two high-level designs for home networks.
The first design — shown in Figure 12-5 — assumes that the residence only
requires access to Internet services. The second design — Figure 12-7 —
shows a slightly more complex implementation where two-way Internet
access is needed. The latter design is ultimately more useful for the digital
home. As features are added to the home network over time, these basic net-
work diagrams increase in scope and complexity.
Once you sketch out your plan, keep your diagram up to date. Good documen-
tation is a great aid when it comes to adding, changing, or troubleshooting.
The basic DSL Internet connection diagram in Figure 12-5 shows a single com-
puter connected to the Internet with the aid of a router/firewall. In this exam-
ple, the DSL modem is connected to a standard phone jack using a line filter;
see Figure 12-6. One side of each line filter has one jack connecting a standard
telephone line plug, and a second jack for connecting Cat 3 cable to the DSL
modem; see Figure 12-1. We recommend that you wire in a jack in your cen-
tral closet and plug in one or more DSL filters as needed. This keeps the
living-space wall jacks in a neater condition. The DSL side of the first filter
goes into the input jack on the DSL modem, also in the central closet area.
When first connecting the service, it may be necessary to connect the Cat 5
or Cat 6 Ethernet cable directly to the computer to sign up with the ISP
before inserting the router/firewall and switch between the modem and the
computer(s). With this type of service, the analog phone signals and the DSL
signals travel along the same twisted-pair copper wire back to the phone
company’s central office. Because each signal is carried on different frequen-
cies, you can use the phone at the same time you use the Internet.

Chapter 12: Home Networks and Internet Connections

The copper wire connecting the residence and the phone company’s central
office is referred to as the last mile. To get DSL service, the copper line serv-
ing your residence must be within the distance limits allowed by the
provider. These distances vary depending on the equipment used and usually
range from 2 to 3 miles, or sometimes more.
The ideal home network design for the digital home should look more like
Figure 12-7. The major difference between the designs in Figures 12-5 and 12-7
is that an additional firewall/router has been added to open access to Web
servers and devices like webcams used for surveillance. The use of a second
firewall device helps protect the computers and simplifies the rules for your
access control strategy on both firewalls. These additional devices use some
of your additional static IP addresses, if you have any. The added cost of an
Internet service package with more than one static IP address facilitates
including all the value-added services you may want. To control these addi-
tional devices from a distant point on the Internet, install a VPN concentrator
for providing these services over a secure communication link on this side of
your network.
By separating the different parts of your network into discrete branches, you
gain security control and increase utility with fewer risks. Of course, these dia-
grams are only a starting point. Adding devices to your network and adding
allowed Web sites and Web servers to your firewall rules can easily become a
recurring hobby for the whole family. The possibilities are only limited by your
imagination as new networking technologies open up more possibilities every

Chapter 13
Integrating Computer Controls
and Voice Technology
In This Chapter
 Planning for home automation controls
 Connecting a control computer to your home’s wiring systems
 Controlling your home using voice commands
 Programming home automation controls
S
ome people are control enthusiasts (okay, control freaks) and have a
hard time giving over the reins. If you’re an enthusiast, you may wish you
could control everything remotely. Oh sure, in Chapter 5 we show you how to
install remote controls for lights and other home features. But now imagine
controlling your home with your voice. This may sound like science fiction
(or something that requires an expensive butler), but this type of control is
possible right now.
In spite of your enthusiasm for control, you may harbor a disdain for repeti-
tive or annoying tasks, such as turning off the outdoor garage lights, shutting
the garage door, or activating the lawn sprinklers. The home automation soft-
ware and hardware described in this chapter can take care of such repetitive
tasks. You don’t have to be a card-carrying computer geek to reap the bene-
fits of home automation. Some technically proficient do-it-yourselfers may
have led the way, but anyone can install automation components. After atten-
tive installation, the care and feeding of said systems may require no more
maintenance than a refrigerator. This chapter describes some of the
advanced automation controls you can integrate into your home.
Selecting Home Automation Components
If you want to bring electrical systems under voice command, as if your home
were a starship zooming to distant galaxies, you’re going to need some spe-
cialized equipment. Don’t worry — you don’t need hyperdrive modulators or

dilithium crystals. All you need is the right software and hardware. The fol-
lowing sections introduce you to those things — all of them available right
now — to make your home ready for the 21st century and beyond.
Choosing automation software
The best way to automate your home is to use a software program that runs
on your personal computer. Many home automation programs are commer-
cially available. We recommend HAL, which is short for Home Automated
Living, the name of the company that produces several versions of home
automation software (www.automatedliving.com). The HAL software runs
on any computer running recent versions of Microsoft Windows.
Home Automated Living currently offers three versions of the HAL software:
 HALbasic: If you’re on a budget, HALbasic gets you going with a limited
feature set.
 HALdeluxe: Once HALbasic is up and running, upgrading to HALdeluxe
is easy. It has all the basic features, plus things such as caller ID.
 HAL2000: Version 3.5.0 (or greater) provides the richest feature set,
with an extensive laundry list of control devices that will work well with
the software. With a list price of only $369, HAL2000 should be on your
purchase list (or at least be an upgrade goal).
Several add-on programs are available for the HAL programs:
 HALvoices: These add-ons are available for all versions of HAL and pro-
vide a more human voice for command responses (as opposed to the
standard robotic voice). Two versions of the add-on are available:
• U.S. English with a male voice (Michael) and a female voice
(Michelle).
• U.K. English with a male voice (Charles) and a female voice
(Audrey).
We like the voice named Audrey the best, but if you have youngsters in
the house they may prefer the standard robotic voice. The HAL Web site
has samples of the voices.
 HALdmc: Think of HALdmc as your personal digital disc jockey. This
add-on allows you to control music playback via voice commands, and
you can bring up particular songs when you issue certain commands.
For example, you can program a tune to play when you give a command
to dim the lights.
206
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

In Chapter 9, we discuss room-to-room stereo systems and multi-zone,
multi-source controller-amplifiers. There we recommend systems with
multiple inputs. If you have such a system, one of the inputs can connect
to a computer running HALdmc. Using the computer and the HAL soft-
ware, you can play CDs, MP3 files, and WMA files anywhere in the house.
When used in conjunction with HAL, you can easily control music, audio
books, or learning and motivational CDs. Also, if you would only like to
control music, you can deploy the HALdmc digital disk jockey software
without using X10 light switches or the other appliance-control features
provided by the HAL control programs.
 HALdvc: This add-on integrates HAL with your home surveillance record-
ing system. It allows you to control recording and playback by voice or to
automate recording tasks. HALdvc works with IP webcams, closed-circuit
TV, and other surveillance cameras like those described in Chapter 11.
See Chapter 14 for more on security zones and alarm systems.
Selecting a computer to run HAL
The system requirements for HAL software are modest by most current PC
standards, but we recommend going beyond the minimum requirements.
The computer that runs your HAL software should have
 Plenty of Random Access Memory (RAM)
 A big hard drive for plenty of storage space
 A fast processor.
Although powerful computers are attractively priced today, this isn’t the best
place to squeeze the budget for your automated home. Purchase modern,
reliable computer equipment under extended warranty, so it can serve you
reliably for many years.
To run HAL now and in the future, we recommend that your computer should
meet these requirements:
 Case: Tower case with at least a 400-watt power supply and four drive
bays
 System board (also called the motherboard):
• PCI Express slot
• Three PCI slots
• Built-in network interface card (NIC)
• Sound card
207
Chapter 13: Integrating Computer Controls and Voice Technology

 Operating system: We recommend Windows XP Professional with cur-
rent service packs installed. (HAL will run on Windows 98, Windows Me,
Windows XP, and Windows 2000, but the higher level of security features
available in Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Professional
make these versions a better choice. Also, Windows 98 will no longer
be supported in any appreciable way by Microsoft.)
 Processor: Any Intel Pentium or equal processor running at 2.66 GHz
 RAM: At least 1 gigabyte (and 2GB or more isn’t a bad idea)
 Storage and drives:
• 250GB; 7,200RPM hard drive
• CD-RW/DVD-ROM removable media drive
Secondary hard drives and network attached storage drives are also
nice to have because they give you extra storage space for music, sur-
veillance video, and other large files.
 PCI card: HAL Voice Portal card
 Interfaces:
• Serial com ports 1, 2, 3, and 4
(You may need to install an additional card in an available PCI or
ISA slot in your PC to gain serial com ports 3 and 4.)
• 9-in-1 card reader
• Three or more USB ports
• Parallel port
 Network interface:
• 10/100 Mbps built-in or PCI NIC
• A second 1,000 Mbps NIC
If you’re using your PC to play a lot of music, we recommend that you install
a high-quality sound card such as Creative Labs’ Sound Blaster card. You
can’t use your high-quality amplifiers and speakers to their full potential if
they’re attached to an inferior sound card.
A natural human voice is typically in the range of 200 Hz to 7 kHz. This range
is well within the capabilities of even basic sound cards, so the recommenda-
tion for a high-quality sound card is only for music playback. For HAL voice
synthesis, the system board’s built-in sound card should be adequate.
208
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

Wiring Your Home Automation Computer
The computer controlling your home automation system may seem to take
on a personality of its own after a while. This is especially true if you regu-
larly communicate with the computer using voice commands. You may come
to think of the computer as your own personal protocol droid — kind of like
C-3PO. In the next few sections we introduce the most important pieces of
equipment, connections, and wiring you need to make the communications
system work.
Connecting HAL to the telephone
A good way to control your home automation computer is by using the plain
old telephone system (POTS). When HAL software connects to the phone
system, you can send commands to HAL from a phone within your home, as
well as from a phone that’s halfway around the world. Actually, controlling
HAL from phones outside your house may be easier: To control HAL from
inside phones, your phone system must be wired so that all phones used to
control HAL are connected to the POTS’s NID through the HAL computer’s
HAL Internal PCI Voice Portal.
In Chapter 6, we describe the Network Interface Device (NID), which is pro-
vided by the phone company in most markets. If you only have one phone
line coming into your house, you must route it through the HAL Voice Portal
and then out to the other extensions. Install two phone jacks near the HAL
computer, as shown in the upper left of Figure 13-1. The phone line should be
routed from the first jack directly to the NID. The second jack feeds a punch-
down block where other home phone extensions are connected.
Installing voice-command stations
To control your HAL system using voice commands, you should install voice-
command stations at strategic locations throughout your home. Each com-
mand station consists of
 A microphone, which allows HAL to receive your commands — “HAL,
dim the lights,” “HAL, pause the music,” “HAL, open the pod bay doors.”
 Speakers, which allow HAL to provide audible feedback and play music.
209
Chapter 13: Integrating Computer Controls and Voice Technology

Connecting a microphone to the sound card on the PC that runs HAL software
provides another way to give voice commands. But most folks want more than
one microphone (and more than one place in the house to interact with the
control software).
To give voice commands from multiple places in the house, you can install a
microphone mixer to feed the voice commands spoken throughout the house
to the computer’s sound card. A microphone mixer is a device that takes the
input from two or more microphones and combines them so that you only
need to use a single input jack to plug into the sound card. A microphone
mixer also controls the strength (or volume) of the input signal supplied to
the amplifier from the various microphones, and it compensates for the
length of the microphone wires and the differences in the acoustics and back-
ground noises in the various locations where you installed the microphones.
Mixers with automatic volume controls are available, but tend to be expen-
sive. Consider installing a mixer with slide controls that enable you to adjust

each microphone’s volume manually. Also consider the location of the micro-
phones, and how far your voice will travel before the microphone picks it up.
Ideally, you want to have the microphones located where you spend the most
time in each room. This way, you don’t have to get up from your recliner to
have HALdmc play “I Walk The Line” by Johnny Cash.
The speakers in each voice-command station can provide voice feedback
after executing commands. However, you should consider when you do and
when you don’t need this feedback. If feedback for every mundane task is
piped through the speakers in every room, your family may start to feel like
they’re living on a Navy ship where every five minutes the boatswains mate
pipes, “Sweepers, sweepers, man your brooms.”
Now that you know what the voice-command stations do, you’re probably
wondering what they look like. As far as we know, voice-command stations
don’t come in simple off-the-shelf solutions, so we recommend using slightly
modified intercom station faceplates over two-gang boxes. This do-it-yourself
project is fairly simple.
To create your command stations, follow these general steps:
1. Buy a faceplate for an intercom system like those described in
Chapter 7.
If you can’t buy just the faceplate, start with a regular intercom station
and remove the original speaker.
2. Replace the faceplate’s single original speaker with two small speakers.
You can find speakers at electronics stores like RadioShack. You want to
install two speakers because your sound card output is in stereo.
The voice-command station and your home intercom system can share
speakers. Keep in mind, however, that if you wire the synthesized voice
output from HAL into the regular intercom system, voice feedback from
HAL will be piped all over the house, Navy style.
3. If the faceplate doesn’t already have a Push to Talk button, install one.
4. Drill a hole in the faceplate to accommodate a two-pole three-position
(DPDT with OFF) slide or push switch.
5. Drill a second hole to accommodate the face of a small microphone
below the speaker grill.
For best results, choose an omnidirectional microphone in the voice-
command station. Ideally, the station unit is mounted about 4' above the
floor. Connect the microphone to the mic input on the control com-
puter’s sound card; if you’ll have more than one voice-command station,
the microphone for each unit needs to connect to a microphone mixer.
211
Chapter 13: Integrating Computer Controls and Voice Technology

Wireless microphones are available for your voice-command station.
A wireless mic may come in handy if you have a physical limitation that
makes using a wall-mounted microphone difficult.
6. Use the existing volume control or install one in the blank faceplate.
7. Run Cat 6 cable from the voice-command station to the mixer.
If you haven’t done so already, connect the mixer and computer sound
card with Cat 6 cable or shielded audio cable.
8. Wire the three-position switch so you can turn off the unit entirely,
transfer control to the Push to Talk button, or leave the microphone
on all the time.
To do this, wire the center (common) connections on the switch to the
lines leading to the microphone mixer or input into the sound card. Use
the contacts that connect to the center pins when the switch is moved
to the first On position to wire to the first connection on the Push to
Talk button. From the other side of the Push to Talk button, connect to
the microphone. (Then when you press the Push to Talk button, the
microphone is connected to the sound input on the computer.) From the
second On position, the contacts of the three-position switch are wired
to bypass the Push to Talk button right to the microphone. (Then when
the three-position switch is in the second On position, the microphone
is on all the time.) When the three-position switch is in the middle, the
microphone is off and pushing the Push to Talk button does nothing.
Figure 13-2 shows how your completed voice-command center might look.
You can also make a movable remote control for your voice-command sta-
tion. Mount the intercom faceplate and other hardware in an attractive box,
and then connect it to the Cat 6 cable via an RJ-45 jack. Now you can set the
control next to the easy chair and play Mozart on command.
Fancy voice-command stations like the one described here aren’t absolutely
mandatory. If you wish to just keep things simple, connect the synthesized
voice output to an amplifier and bullhorn-style speakers centrally located in
the house. This solution may not seem ideal, but it is definitely simple.
Interfacing with the home’s
electrical system
To actually control your home’s lights and stereos, the computer running
HAL must be able to interface with the home’s electrical systems. Interface
control and automation is easiest if you have already installed an advanced
control system such as X10 or Universal Powerline Bus (UPB). See Chapter 5
for more on X10 and UPB devices.
212
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

Automation software can control many proprietary and open-standard devices.
(X10 is an example of an open standard where devices are made by more than
one company and are designed to be compatible with the X10 standard.) These
devices simply plug into a power outlet and into the computer using either a
serial or USB port. The signals injected into the control module by the com-
puter travel to the X10 switches, dimmers, and receptacles over your home’s
wiring. When you issue commands, the computer sends an address-coded
signal through the power lines to do as you commanded. For example, the
signal may turn on the coffee pot, dim the lights, or open a door lock.

Chapter 13: Integrating Computer Controls and Voice Technology

Although any 120-volt outlet will work as an automation interface, we
strongly recommend that the outlet for the automation computer be on a
separate circuit from the rest of the house. It should be on a dedicated 15-
amp circuit breaker using 14 AWG wire between the outlets and the home’s
main power distribution panel.
Review the automation software’s documentation to see what interface
devices are supported. This helps as you plan and shop for controls. Where
possible, select electrical and interface devices offering USB connectivity.
Some devices can only connect to a computer using the computer’s tradi-
tional serial ports.
If you have special devices that your automation software doesn’t support,
you may have to wait until a control for it becomes available or consult with
a professional electrician and a computer programmer to make everything
work. You may even be able to do some creative daisy chaining so that a sup-
ported interface triggers a switch that controls an unsupported device.
Providing backup power to
the automation system
In Chapter 15, we discuss backup power systems and note that part of
installing backup power is deciding which home systems are critical. Your
home automation system may or may not meet your personal checklist as a
critical item, but we recommend that you at least install a UPS (uninterrupt-
ible power supply) for the automation computer, which provides backup
power for a few minutes.
This UPS provides several important advantages:
 A UPS compensates for short duration spikes and dips in the power sup-
plied to the control system’s computer.
 If you have a whole-home backup generator, the UPS protects the PC for
the few seconds it takes for your backup generator to come online.
 If power is lost, the UPS triggers a gentle shutdown process for the com-
puter. For this to work, the UPS must be connected to the computer
using either a USB or serial cable, and special control software must be
installed on the computer. Initializing a proper shutdown when battery
power is low protects your computer from damage and data loss.
 You can use a networked version of the UPS software to send signals over
the network to shut down other computers and servers on UPS devices.
Several companies offer UPS devices, and they’re available in any office
supply or home electronics store. We like the products and software made
by American Power Conversion (www.apcc.com).
214
Part III: Installing Home Networks and Advanced Technology 

Networking your automation system
The value of home automation software doesn’t have to end at the walls. If
the automation control computer is connected to the Internet, you can view
the latest video from webcam at the front door to see who stopped by while
you’re on assignment elsewhere.
An Internet connection is necessary to reap the full benefits of automation
software. You should also install a network drop near the automation com-
puter and connect the computer to the rest of your home network. (We
describe networking and Internet connections in Chapter 12.) With providers
offering DSL Internet service in some markets for as little as $15 per month,
having Internet access is no longer a luxury. You may even be able to recoup
some or all of that cost by using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone
services as discussed in Chapter 6.
As you go beyond the automated control system basics mentioned in this
chapter, you may need additional cables and connections. Install your
home automation computer and connections in a space that will accommo-
date future additions to your system. Also, always maintain some clear
space around the equipment and connections for future maintenance and
modification.
Programming the automation interfaces
After all of your hardware is installed and properly connected, it’s time to con-
figure the HAL software to interface with the devices in your home. If you have
ever used a Windows program before, you will find the HAL software easy to
use. All you need to know to program your home automation controls is how
to make selections from drop-down menus and text boxes. The manuals pro-
vided with the software are great both for reference and training as they take
you though the initial configuration steps and into advanced customization.
The HAL software provides a wizard to guide you through the steps to inter-
face with the devices in your home. The following steps take you through a
common interface setup with the HAL software — configuring an automated
X10 switch:
1. Launch the HAL software by choosing Start➪All Programs➪HAL.
The HAL system screen appears.
2. Select the Devices tab and click the Add button.
The Device Wizard screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-3.
215
Chapter 13: Integrating Computer Controls and Voice Technology

3. From the Type drop-down menu, select the kind of device to configure.
Figure 13-3 shows X10 chosen (because we’re configuring an X10 device
for this example).
4. From the Location drop-down menus, select the appropriate room.
See Figure 13-4.
5. From Device drop-down menu, select the appropriate device.
As you choose from the Location and Device drop-down menus, a name
for the device appears in the long text field at the bottom, as shown in
Figure 13-4. Each device must have a unique name in this field. The
device name is important because this is how the HAL software identi-
fies the device when you issue a voice command. For example, we’re set-
ting up for the living room lights in this example, and so we gave it the
name Living Room Light. If you name your HAL software Gertrude during
installation, you issue a command by saying, “Gertrude, please turn on
the living room light.”
Name your devices so that each name is distinct. Try to avoid using
device names that sound too similar — for example, Bedroom Lights and
Bathroom Lights. You might want to use Kathy’s Room Lights instead of
Bedroom Lights, so that the device name is easy to remember but still
unique.

8. Click Next, and set options unique to the device.
As you can see in Figure 13-6, this screen is where you set each device’s
behavior. Some devices can simply turn on and off, while others are dim-
mable or have other options.
9. Test the device by clicking one of the test buttons shown in Figure 13-6.
The test buttons include On, Off, and Dim. To turn off a device that’s cur-
rently on, click the Off button.
10. Click Next to finish setting up that one device.
The Assigning Groups window appears, enabling you to assign the
device to a group. If you do so, you can control every device in that
group with a single command. For example, you can assign every light in
the house to a group called House Lights, and then turn on or off all the
lights with a single command.
11. If you want to, assign the device to a group.
12. When you’re finished, click the OK button.
Okay, it is time to ready, set, program your own Gertrude or Gilbert. Setting
up home automation controls can be fun and certainly provides some extra
freedom.

H
ome alarm systems aren’t a modern invention. “Burglar alarms” are
now more commonly called intrusion detection and control systems.
Along with intrusion detection (in layman’s terms, that’s “knowing when
someone’s breaking in”), modern alarm systems can detect fire, carbon
monoxide, temperature, and water. They may also provide remote monitoring
so you can keep an eye on your home even when you’re not there.
In this chapter, we show how to wire and install various alarm systems and
devices, including surveillance. We also show how to integrate these systems
into your communications systems. Finally, we help you assess the risks in
and around your home, and introduce you to common-sense steps that make
your home safer. If you feel your home is your castle but don’t want to dig a
moat or hire a fire-breathing dragon, this chapter helps.
Protecting Your Home with Alarms
The alarms available today offer a lot of options while also being relatively
inexpensive. In our view, even a system with modest features is better than
none at all. Many of the individual alarm components discussed in this section

are available in many building- and home-improvement supply stores. You can
get some of the specialty items at electrical-supply stores or from alarm instal-
lation contractors.
Your alarm system can begin as a basic control unit, and you can add fea-
tures as your needs require and budget allows. Our recommendation is to
include alarm wiring to every location where an alarm may be needed during
initial construction or during any major remodeling project. The wire itself is
inexpensive and much easier to include before the drywall is in place.
Comparing intrusion alarms
Your alarm has parts just like you do:
 The dukes: alarm company sign. The most important part is the alarm
company sign in your yard, which can deter an intruder.
 The heart: intrusion alarm panel. This is preferably located out of
sight. All of the sensors and control keypads are wired to this panel.
 The brain: operations center. This keypad should be in a convenient
location. The monitor and control keypad is located near the door you
most often use to leave the house. This operations center allows you to
arm the system as you leave and set a time delay to disarm the system
when you get back (but you can add keypads to other locations). You
indicate that you’re not an intruder by entering a security code. Some
controls also have one-button access to emergency numbers, while
others allow you to arm and disarm with a key chain remote, or by using
the Internet or a touch-tone phone.
 The nerves: control panel. The center is wired to door, window, and
motion sensors and is usually in the basement or a mechanical equipment
area. If any of the sensors signals the system, it activates a signal to alert
you of the findings. The signal can be audio, visual, or both, and it can be
in one or multiple locations. The center can also automatically make
phone calls for help. The central control panel should be out of sight and
locked. A metal mounting box with a hinged, locking, plain-metal cover
recessed into a wall can also provide protection for the control panel.
Some alarm systems incorporate the control panel into the convenient
access pad. These systems are often used in smaller spaces and apart-
ments and have the siren, phone dialer, and battery backup all in one
location. When an experienced intruder hears the siren and recognizes
this type of unit, he can simply smash it, putting the alarm system out of
operation before it can dial the monitoring company or the police. For
best security we recommend that you avoid such systems.
222
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Intrusion-detection systems can be divided into two basic types:
 Single zone: A typical intruder alarm system consists of one central con-
trol unit. These systems usually have a 120-volt power unit and include a
battery backup to ensure operation when the power goes out (whether
due to natural causes or intruder disconnection). The central unit is
wired to sensor switches at doors and windows using two-conductor
cable. A single-zone system drawback is that the whole shebang is either
enabled or disabled.
 Multiple zone: A security zone is an area you’ve defined. Larger homes
may have six or more unique security zones. You can control each zone
independently, depending on its use or need. Turn off the kitchen moni-
toring if you plan to be in there for a while, but leave the other zones
fully armed. We recommend multiple-zone systems.
Understanding sensors
Your alarm’s control system needs something to monitor, and that something
is sensors — the devices that tell the central control system when a door or
window has been opened, or when motion has been detected.
Magnetic
Alarm systems use one of two types of magnetic sensors for doors and
windows:
 Closed-circuit: Closed-circuit door and window sensors are two-part
magnetic switches. The magnet is mounted securely to the window
frame or door, which is the moving item. The on/off switch is mounted
to the stationary door or window casing. When you open the door or
window, the switch opens (breaks contact) and opens a circuit to the
central control. This initiates the alarm process, which may include a
local alarm, phone dialing, and other actions. Figure 14-1 shows a typical
magnetic window switch. Notice that the actuator magnet is separate
from the wired half of the sensor. The actuator magnet is mounted to the
door, so it makes more sense to make this the moving part. Failed wires
on an closed-circuit system make themselves immediately known. A
broken wire sends an alarm just as a sensor switching to open would.
We believe closed-circuit systems are more reliable because they con-
stantly monitor themselves.
 Open-circuit: These systems also use magnetic sensors at doors and
windows, but the circuit closes instead of opening when the door or
window opens. If a wire or connection fails on a open-circuit system,
you’ve no way to detect it without testing.
223
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems

Nonmagnetic
Alarm systems use one of two types of nonmagnetic sensors for doors and
windows:
 Button switches: These magnetic switch alternatives are recessed into
the doorframe. A ball or probe on the switch face moves back and forth
to operate when the door is opened or closed. Button switches are avail-
able to match open- or closed-circuit systems with switch types that are
normally open (off) or normally closed (on).
 Motion: Detectors for motion come in two flavors:
• Passive Infrared (PIR): You may get a false alarm from this heat
detector if you aim it toward heat sources such as ducts or sunlit
windows.
• Dual Technology (DT): This type emits high-frequency sound
waves that bounce back to the sensor. With those waves it can
detect heat and disturbances. Both elements — fluctuating heat
and disrupted sound reflection — must be present to trip this
alarm. DT sensors usually detect pets, although some are sophisti-
cated enough to ignore small ones.
Wiring and installing sensors
Unless your control-equipment manufacturer recommends otherwise, all of
the alarm sensors will be wired using a four-conductor, 22 AWG or heavier,
unshielded cable with solid or twisted-copper conductors. The cable should
also have a UL Class-2 rating.

Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Cable from each switch location is a home run directly to the master control
unit location. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for pre-planning,
drilling, and installing the wiring. Also, check out Chapter 3 for additional
home wiring tips and guidelines. Try to keep the wiring and the switch sen-
sors hidden and protected to increase the alarm’s security and reliability. As
with other low-voltage, communication, or control wiring, maintain sufficient
separation from home power wiring. We recommend at least 4" to 6" or more
of separation on parallel runs.
When installing alarm trip switches on doors or windows, drill for (and per-
haps install) the switches in the door and window casements prior to them
being installed in the house framing. Of course this only applies to new con-
struction or major remodels. Having nearly unobstructed access to door and
window casements makes the installation and wiring job far easier. If you’re
going to equip many windows of similar construction with switches, use a
drill or routing template. Also keep in mind that switches may fail and need
replacement, so leave some hidden slack in the wires. Many spring or ball
switches have metal cover plates screwed into the wood that you can remove
for switch replacement.
When using DT or PIR motion sensors, follow the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions for wiring. Motion sensors often require two sets of unshielded twisted-
pair cable. One twisted pair carries the alarm trip signal to the control unit, and
the other pair brings low-voltage DC power to the sensor device. Some sensors
may need to plug into a 120-volt power outlet instead.
Increasing safety with 
supplemental alarms
Intruders aren’t the only potential hazard. You can install many other types
of detectors: smoke alarms, carbon monoxide, high water, low temperature,
and propane or natural gas detectors. The following sections introduce you
to some common supplemental alarms that you should use in your home.
Smoke alarms
Smoke alarms are a must in every residence and are required by building
codes in new construction. As a starting point, building codes require at least
one 120 volt interconnected smoke detector with battery backup in each of
the following locations:
 On every floor, including the basement.
 In every bedroom hallway, within 6' bedroom doors (unless local codes
require an alternative placement); the hallway detector counts for that
floor.
 In every bedroom.
225
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems

Code also now requires smoke detection alarms to be interconnected. The
interconnection causes every alarm to sound when only one of them detects
smoke. The interconnect wiring is three-conductor cable; one power, one
neutral, and one interconnection conductor.
The National Electrical Code (NEC) requires that bedroom power circuits be
arc-fault protected, so smoke alarms are often supplied with power on the
bedroom lighting circuit. Frequently, local building codes require additional
smoke alarms, both in terms of numbers and locations. Modern smoke
alarms are typically wired with 120-volt power during the electrical rough in.
See Chapter 3 for additional rough-in wiring information.
Three additional wiring types for smoke and fire alarms include NPLFA (non-
power limited fire alarm), PLFA (power limited fire alarm), and CI (circuit
integrity). CI cable provides circuit integrity under fire conditions for a speci-
fied time period. See Article 760 of the 2002 NEC for more information about
fire alarm wiring.
Most new smoke alarms, like the one in Figure 14-2, include an on-board 9-
volt backup battery. When the battery’s failing, many models let you know
with a mild (yet annoying) ping. Change the batteries periodically. Without
power outages, the batteries may last four years or more. You hear folks
saying “Replace the batteries when you change the clock back to standard
time.” Whether they know it or not, they’re talking about battery-powered
smoke alarms, not 120-volt smoke alarms with battery backup. In the former,
the battery is only used when the power is out.
Keep spare batteries on hand, just in case at 2 a.m. the battery monitor lets
you know about the impending battery change. Like most batteries, if you
keep spares in the freezer they stay fresh. As soon as they are room tempera-
ture, they can deliver power.
Smoke alarms can stand alone, or they can be tied into the detection control
center to broadcast a warning of any alarm or to dial emergency phone num-
bers. The local alarm is fine if you’re home, but when you’re away you may
want extra protection for pets or people who cannot hear an alarm. An inte-
grated central alarm-control unit can be programmed to call 911, your moni-
toring services contractor, and your cell phone or pager.
Heat detectors
Heat detectors are a good choice for supplementing the smoke alarms in
your home. Put them in mechanical rooms, laundry rooms, attics, storage
rooms, basements, and in the kitchen. Heat detectors are either
 Triggered at a specific temperature
 Triggered by a rise in temperature
 A combination of both
226
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Often, smoke detectors trip false alarms in kitchens or vented attic areas, so
including a heat detector provides added protection. Like smoke detectors,
heat detectors can be wired into your home’s master alarm-control unit.
Carbon monoxide detectors
Carbon monoxide (CO) is referred to as the “silent killer” because the gas is
odorless and tasteless. Your home should have CO monitors if it:
 Has enclosed parking, such as an attached garage.
 Uses any fossil fuel heating or refrigeration source.
 Has a fossil fuel electrical generator within close proximity.
Although not required in every state, CO detectors can help prevent death or
serious injury if any of the fossil fuel-burning appliances, furnaces, refrigera-
tors, or combustion engines cause a harmful buildup of CO. Figure 14-3 shows
one of the many styles of CO detectors available at building-supply stores.
Just like smoke alarms, CO detectors can be hardwired in and interconnected,
and you can link them to the central alarm control unit. CO detectors use the
same three-wire cable smoke detectors use. Rather than using CO detectors in
the following areas, it may be better to use smoke-CO–combination detectors.
Figure 14-2:
Smoke
alarms

backup.
227
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems

CO detectors should be installed in all habitable and enclosed areas of your
home. Like smoke alarms, this means one
 On every floor, including the basement
 In every bedroom hallway
 In every bedroom
Check with your local building code officials for specific requirements in your
area. If you don’t have CO detectors and you do have fossil fuel appliances or
an attached garage, get some immediate protection from CO detectors that
plug into your electrical outlets. If you buy a battery-powered detector, select
one with battery-charge monitors, and remember to change the batteries at
least twice yearly.
CO detectors are likely to become a code requirement for all homes, apart-
ments, and work areas. If you’re building a home, protect your family by
installing smoke-CO–combination detectors even if your local codes don’t
currently require them.
Radon detectors
Radon (Rn) is a radioactive gas that emits metallic particles, as well as cancer-
causing alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Radon is odorless and invisible.

Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

According to the United States’ Surgeon General, radon is second only to
smoking in causing lung cancer deaths. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency publishes comparative maps of areas prone to moderate or high levels
of radon in the soil, water, and rock. The maps are at www.epa.gov/radon/
zonemap.html.
Radon levels can be tested using a one-time test kit, or with a constant air
monitor. Radon is measured in pCi/L (pico-Curies per liter) of air. In the U.S.,
the EPA says that any level over 4 requires corrective action. Other countries
have set a lower threshold for concern, and some states (like New Jersey) are
trying to lower their standard to 2 pCi/L. For more information on radon and
its dangers see www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/citguide.html, or con-
tact the EPA or your state’s radon office.
Consumer Rn detectors typically only have a local alarm and LED. Select an
evaluated Rn detector accepted by the U.S. EPA. Wiring for an Rn detector
simply requires a well-placed outlet, and the detectors should be on every
floor, including the basement and attic, away from doors, windows, and
air ducts. Placing Rn detectors away from well-ventilated areas ensures
effectiveness.
The display readings can be periodically evaluated using a professional moni-
toring service or by sending in a test kit once or twice per year. Plug-in Rn
detectors cost about $150 to $200. If you detect radon, you can lower the
risk by installing vent pipes and ventilation equipment at a typical cost of
$800 to $1,200.
Flood or high water alarms
More than one homeowner has had the unpleasant surprise of a burst water
pipe or overflowed plumbing. A flood or high-water alarm usually detects ele-
vated moisture levels or small water leaks. Others may include float switches
that detect the presence of high water. The devices can sound alarms, or
they can be set up to turn off the water supply to a specific appliance such
as a clothes washer, water heater, refrigerator, water/ice dispenser, or even
the whole home. Some systems detect a very thin layer of water, call a pro-
grammed phone number, and describe the flooding based on which sensors
are tripped. Sensors may also monitor sump pumps to make sure they’re
working correctly.
Freezing or overheating alarms
Heating and cooling system alarms can detect falling or rising temperatures.
When a potentially hazardous fluctuation is detected, they can trigger an
alarm and notify you, a neighbor, or an alarm-monitoring company before any
major damage occurs. Freeze alarms are an important consideration in north-
ern climates, because water heating systems and pipes can freeze and burst,
causing flooding that can destroy a home.
229
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems

The simplest freeze alarm is a thermostat that turns on a colored light in a
window (so a neighbor can see potential freezing while you’re away). You can
set the light to illuminate at a specific temperature, such as 40 degrees
Fahrenheit. With a master alarm-control unit, you can preset high or low tem-
peratures for alarm tripping.
Personal medical event alarms
You can add medical-alert services to some alarm systems, and standalone
medical alarms are also available. With these services, an alarm alerts the 
medical-alert monitoring company; it can call emergency help for you. You may
want to consider whether someone in your family needs medical-alert services
when you select a master control unit. Also make sure that emergency backup
power (described in Chapter 15) is available for critical medical equipment.
Alarm systems may make you eligible for discounts on your homeowner’s
insurance premium. Check with your agent to see if your system qualifies
for discounts. In some states, alarms must be installed by contractors
specifically licensed to do alarm systems, so check with your local building
code-enforcement office to see if you can install them yourself. See Chapter 1
for tips on selecting electrical contractors; these same tips apply to alarm
contractors as well.
Wireless sensors
Many, if not all, of the sensors mentioned in this chapter are available in wire-
less versions. Wireless sensors may seem like an attractive option, especially
if you’re retrofitting an alarm system in an older home or have to wire remote
areas.
However, wireless sensors
 May not be as easy to assemble into one integrated system because
wireless sensors are usually brand sensitive. Sensors from one manufac-
turer may not work with control units from another manufacturer. This
isn’t usually a problem with hardwired sensors.
 Are usually considered less reliable because they’re prone to radio inter-
ference. Interference can cause false alarms or disrupted monitoring.
 Have batteries that need to be replaced or charged.
The copper wire for alarm systems can be solid or multi-stranded. On stranded
wire, one whisker (strand) can make a connection that tests okay but fails to
carry enough current to trigger during an alarm. Our advice is to test all On/Off
switch circuits with the switch in the On condition. Perform the test using an
ohmmeter and test for a low-resistance reading before connecting the circuits
to the control module. Keep a log of your test readings. Should you need to
troubleshoot the circuits later, these readings will be valuable. Chapter 20
covers some popular troubleshooting tips.
230
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

A cell phone is another wireless element you may want to add to your alarm
system. A more sophisticated and determined intruder may know that if he
cuts your telephone line he can put your security system out of order. He may
also be smart enough to do this at the utility pole before entering your prop-
erty. A cell phone acts as a backup. In this case, a wireless notification system
can be harder to defeat than a wired system, so long as cellular service is avail-
able and reliable. One risk with cell-phone notification is potentially delayed
call setup time: If many people are using the closest cell tower, there may be a
significant time delay before your call is initiated.
Surveilling Your Surroundings
Even if you have eyes in the back of your head, you won’t be able to watch
every part of your home all the time. This means that surveillance must be
a key consideration as you plan your home’s security system. Surveillance
equipment can vary from a simple digital camera to a complete closed-circuit
TV (CCTV) system. Most systems also incorporate infrared sensing so that
they only photograph or monitor areas of your home when people are in a
camera’s field of view. You could even use a webcam to monitor areas of your
home and provide a view of your property over the Internet or on a Web-
capable cellular phone. The following sections introduce you to the most
common types of cameras used in a home surveillance system.
Digital cameras
A digital camera wired to a monitoring switch can give you a record of who has
been on your property. Some models can store up to 50,000 images on a time-
lapse basis. You can operate most digital cameras by remote signal from a door
opener or a manually given command. A drawback to remote digital surveil-
lance cameras is that you have to charge the camera’s battery frequently.
Closed-circuit television (CCTV)
A CCTV system generally consists of a camera that is activated by an infrared
sensor, a VCR, and a video monitor. A system that has to monitor a large area
may incorporate several cameras.
Traditional CCTV monitoring systems are less popular and less efficient
than modern digital systems, and CCTV systems are destined to continue
that decline, if not become altogether obsolete. Some specialized equipment
can use the analog cameras and convert their images to digital signals,
which can then be stored on a computer.
231
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems

If you’re buying a new surveillance system, we recommend avoiding CCTV
systems, even if they use a digital video recorder (DVR). Some manufacturers
market such systems as if they were all-digital. When buying a system, make
sure the cameras are digital as well as the recorder. There’s nothing wrong
with using analog equipment that Uncle Bob gives you. It’s just that analog
CCTV quality doesn’t compare to digital.
The wiring install for a CCTV remote camera is a 120-volt power circuit to
provide camera power, plus an RG-6 coaxial cable to carry the video signal.
Some equipment requires a third wire to allow the camera to communicate
with your home’s alarm system.
Webcams
An Internet protocol (IP) webcam may be the best modern option for video
surveillance. Webcams are similar to a digital PC camera, except that the
webcam also processes the digital signal on board and transmits the informa-
tion in data packets. Webcams can be linked to a file server or Web server
that can store still images or full-motion video. From the server, the images
can later be archived onto CDs or DVDs. You can easily configure and manage
IP cameras using Web browsers. See more on IP and wiring for home networks
in Chapter 12.
The webcam pictures are far superior to analog images. Once recorded, the
data doesn’t degrade like analog CCTV/VCR recordings do. The data can be
shared over an Ethernet wired or wireless network, and even over the Internet.
The IP-based information is highly compressed and far less bulky to archive
than VCR tapes. Webcams don’t necessarily need a computer to operate,
although if you want to record video rather than just monitor it, you need a
computer, file server, or Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. You can con-
trol some webcams remotely to rotate 360 degrees, tilt, and zoom. Some high-
end cameras cost more than $2,900, but decent IP cameras can be purchased
for about $200 or less.
Part of the appeal of IP-based webcams is that they let you watch your home
from far away using the Internet. As we discuss in Chapter 12, if you have an
always-on Internet connection and two or more permanently assigned IP
addresses, you can access your IP cameras directly from almost any computer.
You could mount up to 254 (the limit for one network) webcams around your
premises. That’s a lot of monitoring! You can set up a virtual private network
(VPN) with authentication and passwords so that only authorized users can
view the server that hosts and manages the cameras.
Webcams require the same wiring as other computer network equipment.
Each camera requires a network service drop with Cat 6 cable and a home
run to the central wiring closest switch for the network. The major difference
232
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

between camera and computer network wiring is that the boxes with the RJ-
45 connectors are usually mounted higher on the wall (or even in the ceiling)
for cameras. You can recess and cover with an access plate any camera-
mounting locations that a vandal or intruder can get to.
Integrating Alarm and Communication
Systems
The most basic type of alarm system simply makes a sound. For this to be
effective, an audible alarm requires three things:
 A person must be home.
 The person must be able to hear the alarm.
 The person must be able to react to the alarm appropriately. During a
fire, someone who’s bedridden wouldn’t be able to leave the house with-
out help. A person who’s deaf may not hear an alarm.
Take away any one or all three of these elements and the audible system fails.
Thus, it makes sense to interface your alarm system with your communication
system, because then the system is effective even if one of the elements is
missing.
Earlier in this chapter, we mention alarm system auto dialers. Twenty years
ago, most auto dialers called police or sheriff offices, but recently private
alarm monitoring and security companies have taken over most home alarm
monitoring. You can pay a monitoring company, which calls you when an
alarm is detected. If you don’t respond, the company can call the police or
other outside help. Other systems dial a list of preprogrammed phone num-
bers. To head off false calls, generally the 911 administrator doesn’t want 911
on an auto dialer. The list of numbers may include your work or cell phone, a
neighbor’s house, or a relative’s home.
The heart of an auto dialer system is the auto dialer. This device connects to
a standard phone line, and when triggered, dials the monitoring company.
If you have only one phone line to your home and you’re using digital sub-
scriber line (DSL) to connect to the Internet over your copper phone line,
be sure the installation to your dial-tone auto dialer is downstream of a DSL
filter. This provides the dialer with a clean, clear dial tone. Also follow the
alarm manufacturer’s instructions to properly install an RJ-31X jack ahead
of the house phones to give the auto dialer priority for use of the phone line.
If your budget allows, use a dedicated line and phone number for your alarm
system’s auto dialer.
233
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems

You can connect an auto dialer to a cell phone as a backup, or use it as the
primary dialer in areas with no landline service. If the alarm control unit is in
a concrete wall or basement, use a cell phone auto dialer that can connect to
an external antenna, and then
1. Run a cable to an antenna mounted in the attic or on the roof.
2. Use RG-58 or RG-6 cable with the appropriate adapters for this
antenna run.
3. Aim a directional-gain antenna, such as a Yagi, right at the cell tower
serving your phone.
A Yagi-style antenna is designed to be highly directional. The design is
named after a Japanese electrical engineer, Dr. Hidetsugu Yagi, who
invented the concept.
4. If your system uses an external antenna, make sure the cable is prop-
erly grounded and high enough to prevent tampering.
5. Thoroughly test the equipment after installation.
A computer can also interface with the alarm to provide the ability to send a
tripped alarm notice. Once the computer knows the alarm has been tripped,
it can
 Use a modem to dial your pager and send a canned message.
 Send text messages to your cell phone or send a priority e-mail at
your work.
 Notify many phone numbers, in different ways, about any of the alarm
conditions.
Improving Your Home’s Safety
Alarms are just one component in an effective security system. You can
take many steps to improve your safety in and around your home. In the fol-
lowing sections we tell you how to expand and leverage the value from your
alarm.
Get the facts for your area
In some areas folks don’t lock the doors; in others, locks aren’t enough to
keep out unwanted guests. If you’re in an unfamiliar area, you may want to
check with neighbors or the police to assess your risks.
234
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Although your home’s safety and security should be a concern no matter where
you live, it’s important to know the crime picture in your area. For current
crime statistics from the FBI, visit www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm. This informa-
tion will help you more accurately evaluate the major risks in your area.
Screen visitors
Any contractor you hire should be licensed. He should be stable enough to
belong to some trade associations. One such association is the Home Builders
Association (HBA), which screens business owners and requires that all appli-
cants be licensed. Contractors who’ve been in business for a long time are
usually more dependable. The employer’s and his employees’ appearances
are an indicator of their character and work. Someone who comes to work
groomed and in clean clothes shows concern about his appearance. There’s a
good chance he’ll also care about his quality of work.
Be careful who you let into your house. Anyone who becomes familiar with the
premises may put you at risk. A policeman needs a search warrant to access
your home. Don’t let some unknown person in your home that you didn’t invite.
Often, wrongdoers say they’re from the company that installed your pump last
year, or pose as building inspectors or utility workers. An intercom system cou-
pled with a video camera is valuable for this reason. When someone rings the
doorbell, reply over the intercom and ask the visitor to please look into the
security camera so her face can be recorded and identification can be verified;
if necessary, you can then call the company the person says she works for.
235
Chapter 14: Working with Security Zones and Alarm Systems
Electronic control
If a jingling set of keys seems too old fashioned
for your modern digital home, you may want to
consider controlling access electronically. Card
readers are one possibility. Some card readers
work from a distance, such as a driveway gate
opener, so you can simply leave a card on your
car’s dashboard. You may have to wave other
cards directly in front of a reader or pass it
through a slot, like a credit card. Various card
sizes are available, ranging from credit card-
size to smaller key-chain tags.
Other options include numeric keypads or bio-
metric devices. You can integrate keypads with
a card reader so the card holder must enter a
password as well as present the card. Using
two components together is called two-factor
security, and it affords additional security
should you lose the card or have it stolen.
Biometric access controls include devices that
scan your finger or the palm of your hand.
No matter how secure you make your home,
you may need to allow someone in when you
aren’t there. Your house sitter can enter a pass-
word, enter your house, check on your pets, and
water the plants. Then, when you get home, you
can change the password.

Make some security elements visible
You should advertise the security measures used in and around your home.
You may even want to exaggerate this advertisement. If a potential intruder
thinks he’s being recorded on video, that may serve as a powerful deterrent.
Most intruders won’t enter a house if they think it has an alarm system. You
can advertise your security system in a variety of ways:
 Post warnings at doors and windows that say, “This house is protected
by brand X security system,” or “Alarms present.” These signs should be
obvious to the most casual observer. You may also want to install signs
on the lawn.
 Install motion-sensitive lights and position them so they show off your
security warning signs.
 Make one or more cameras noticeable from the outside of your home.
 Include loud alarms that sound when intrusions are detected, and pro-
vide a prerecorded notification over loudspeakers.
Secure your home
Installing an alarm system isn’t going to make your home safe all by itself.
You can and should do many other things to truly secure your home.
Some home security tips include
 When your family is going on vacation, have the post office hold your
mail and subscriptions or have a trusted friend or relative pick them up.
 Don’t leave the lights on all day and night while you’re away. Your lights
should turn off in daylight. Lights on in the daytime are an invitation to
thieves — most burglaries actually occur during daytime — and so is
only one light on at night. Use timers connected to lamps throughout the
house to turn some house lights on and off at different times. You can
even install timers to turn on radios or TVs.
 Locate the security system’s central control unit in an area both out of
sight and under lock and key.
 If you have bushes under the windows, consider installing trip wires or
ground-pressure switches near each window to set off alarms.
 Connect your alarm system to X10 controls, if you use them. Intruders
don’t like bright lights, so discourage them by causing most or all of the
lights in and around your home to turn on when an intrusion alarm is
tripped. See Chapter 5 for more on X10 controls.
236
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

 Flatten and hide boxes from newly purchased electronics and other valu-
able items. They advertise that you have new stuff worth stealing.
 Beef up door-entry hardware and installation. Unless you’ve left win-
dows open, the easiest place to break into a modern house is the front
door. Most intruders know they can open modern doors with one hard
blow near the doorknob. To block this easy entry, install four-screw
strike plates on your door, as shown in Figure 14-4. The stronger four-
screw plates only cost about $6, so they’re cheap insurance. You should
also put one long screw on each of the three door hinges.
Strike plates should be attached with 3" screws instead of the 3⁄4" screws
that come with standard lockset strike plates. The longer screws go into
the door’s rough framing, not just into the trim like a standard attach-
ment. However, if you have a window next to the door, you may have to
use shorter screws. When you install a four-screw strike plate, you have
to enlarge any existing mortise to accommodate the larger strike plate.
The mortise is wood removed to allow the strike plate to flush with the
doorframe. The mortise depth is about 1⁄8" deep and is shaped to accom-
modate the strike plate. The screws should be angled slightly back to
catch the door framing.
 Install shock-detection switches on entry doors in addition to the stan-
dard open-condition sensor switches. Shock-detection switches activate
your alarm when someone tries to force entry into your home, not just
when they actually enter it.

hat if the power goes out? Some convenience items — like the toaster
and maybe the coffee maker — you can probably do without for a
while. Other things are essential — like the refrigerator, medical support
equipment, and the fish tank — and will create expensive and heartbreaking
problems if they don’t have backup power. This chapter introduces you to
the different types backup power systems available, and shows what you
need to install one in your home.
We also introduce you to alternative power sources. Sources like solar and
wind help you reduce your energy bills, and they may serve as emergency
backups if your electrical service goes offline. Some alternative systems may
even allow you to live entirely off the grid, which means your home isn’t even
connected to an electrical utility at all.
Identifying Your Home’s Critical Systems
Be selective about what you need to keep energized during a power outage.
This is especially true if your home is connected to the power grid, which it
is if you pay an electric bill. You may decide that during a utility outage you
only want to energize things such as:
 A few important lights
 Refrigerator
For alternative power systems, you can purchase refrigerators that run
under their own power, which is supplied by a built-in propane or
kerosene generator.
 Furnace

 Smoke, security, carbon monoxide, and radon alarms
 Medical devices
 Sump pump; fresh water pumps
Of course, you could install a system that powers the entire home. Just keep
in mind that the larger the usage list, the more expensive the backup power
equipment will be.
Before you can figure out how much backup system you need, you must
measure how much power the critical devices use and add up the wattages.
Table 15-1 lists typical electricity use for common household appliances and
systems.
Power loads for things like lighting and coffee makers are fairly steady, but
some appliances and pumps with motors create additional load — many
times that of the running load — during startup. Your design must account
for the current used to start the motor, especially for devices such as water
pumps and saws. (The motors in clothes dryers and refrigerators do not
have significant starting currents.)

Besides deciding which systems are critical and which aren’t, try to antici-
pate future needs. It isn’t uncommon for people to spend a couple hundred
dollars on a cheap generator, only to wear it out quickly because it didn’t
have enough capacity. Often, spending a little more money up front results in
savings over the long term.
Comparing Types of Backup Power
Power outages can happen anywhere and anytime, and it seems to us that
power companies are less concerned these days about preventing those out-
ages. Include your power-outage exposure risk as you plan your home, con-
sidering both the likelihood of an outage and the loss you will experience
during an extended outage. This will help you decide how much backup you
need, as well as the best type for you. The following sections describe the
most common types of backup power.
Uninterruptible power supplies
The smallest backup power supply normally used in homes is an uninterrupt-
ible power supply (UPS). A UPS is basically a battery unit that charges itself
when you plug it into wall power, and then provides backup power during an
outage. A UPS most often powers a computer. The battery in a UPS lasts a
finite amount of time. If the power outage is long, you may only have time to
save your computer data before the UPS runs out of power. Most UPS units
used with computers are supplied with a cable and interface software to shut
down the computer before the UPS battery runs out of power.
241
Chapter 15: Backup and Alternative Power
Tallying electric usage
A moderately equipped home uses about 1 kilo-
watt (kW) of electricity per hour for convenience
use. Convenience use means lights, TVs, coffee
makers, toasters, and the like. This estimate
doesn’t include using high-wattage appliances
such as the air conditioner, oven, water heater,
and electric clothes dryer. A family of four that
uses 24 kW per day probably has an electric
stove, water heater, and clothes dryer, along with
the normal convenience appliances. Using 24
kW per day at a rate of 10 cents per kW equates
to a monthly electric bill of about $72.00.

Many commercial-grade UPS units have been taken out of service because
the internal batteries are old and no longer hold a charge. These heavy-duty
units were often designed to provide 1 kW to 3 kW of power. You can get
these units cheaply if the batteries are no good, and in most cases you can
replace the batteries.
Inverter systems
If a computer-style UPS isn’t quite powerful enough to suit your needs, consider
stepping up to an inverter system. A UPS is a self-contained system. It stores
direct current (DC) power in internally housed batteries, and then a component
called the inverter converts that to the alternating current (AC) power most
household electrical devices use. The inverter is a component of an inverter
system. It uses the same technology as the UPS, but the external battery banks
are much larger than those inside a UPS. They both convert battery power into
alternating current (AC) when needed. Figure 15-1 shows a typical inverter.
Most UPS units don’t deliver enough current to power refrigerators and other
big-load systems, but you can install a battery bank and use an inverter to
connect those batteries to your electrical system when necessary. A battery
bank and inverter are basically just a large-scale UPS for your home. A few
hundred dollars’ worth of batteries could power a house on limited use for
several days without a recharge. And like a UPS, the battery bank provides
instant power when an outage occurs; you don’t have to wait for a generator
to start up. When the outage ends, the inverter turns into a battery charger
and recharges the batteries.
In addition to instant startup, a battery bank and inverter make for a very
low-maintenance system. The disadvantage is that you only have power for
the length of time that the batteries’ charges last. For this reason you may
want to add a generator for periodically recharging the batteries during
longer power outages. You can buy an inverter that automatically starts the
generator when the batteries are discharged.
Inverter systems vary enough in size and are uniquely integrated into the
wiring system to handle all or part of the home’s electrical load. As such, they
aren’t normally available in big-box stores. Once you decide on size and fea-
tures, you buy from an electrical supplier, regional distributor, or manufacturer.
Batteries are designed for two primary types of service:
 Lead-acid batteries: Batteries such as the one in your car supply a large
amount of current over a very short time for powering the starter motor.
Once the car starts, the alternator handles the loads.
 Deep-cycle batteries: Batteries such as the one used for a boat’s electric
trolling motors or in electric golf carts supply a steady amount of current
over a long period of time.
242
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Batteries are constructed three ways:
 Gelled cell
 Wet cell
 Absorbed glass mat (AGM)
Lead-acid batteries are either gelled or wet. Of the three listed here, AGM
most resists freezing, produces less gas when charging, and maintains a
charge in storage for longer periods. The drawback is that AGM batteries
are more expensive than standard lead-acid batteries of equal capacity.
To compare batteries’ ampere-hour capacity, always compare against the 
20-hour rating. The higher the ampere-hour rating, the longer the battery
supplies a given load. A 12-volt battery is considered fully discharged when
its produced voltage dips to 101⁄2 volts, which is 13⁄4 volts per cell.
Green power systems
No, this section isn’t about the engines in John Deere tractors. They’re called
green because they don’t cause conventional pollution. Wind and water sys-
tems use their respective mechanical forces to spin generators and generate
DC voltage to charge batteries or use directly.
Figure 15-1:
Inverters

243
Chapter 15: Backup and Alternative Power

So-called green power systems include
 Wind: The cost of wind power blows us away (pun intended). A unit 
that produces 1 kW costs about $3,000. Older systems with batteries
used DC wiring systems within the home. But with the development of
high-efficiency inverters, these DC systems don’t make much sense. In
most cases, springing for an inverter is probably better than buying
home appliances, lights, and accessories that run on 12- or 24-volt DC.
These items aren’t readily available and usually cost more than equiva-
lent 120-volt AC items.
 Solar: Solar panels can produce DC power. These panels need no mainte-
nance other than an occasional cleaning. A 100-watt panel is about 9' × 9'
and costs about $700.
A 100-watt solar panel installed in an area sunny enough to produce
power 10 hours per day will generate 1 kW per day, or 365 kW per year.
Most utilities charge less than a dime per kW. This means that 365 kW
from the power company costs about $36.50. It therefore takes 19 years
for the $700 solar panel to pay for itself. And this doesn’t account for
installation charges or the interest you could’ve earned by investing
your $700 instead.
 Water (hydroelectric): Water-wheel motion can very effectively turn a
generator if your home and property include a stream or creek with a
sufficient waterfall. A waterfall distance of about 10' with ample volume
can be captured at the high mark and piped though a wheel or turbine
that turns the generator. A flow of 15 cubic feet of water per minute
though the turbine with a 10' head produces about 1⁄10 of a kilowatt. A
300-watt low-head water turbine-generator costs about $750. I suspect
these systems may require some kind of permit from the environmental
oversight authority.
From a purely financial standpoint, green power systems only make sense if
the cost of bringing conventional utility power to the home is excessive. Most
utilities charge large installation fees to set and wire poles or trench in under-
ground power lines if your home is more than 1,000' from the nearest service
line, so take this into consideration when you look at green power systems.
Often these fees are a lot more than the purchase of an independent power
system. If you need to use fuel backup along with green power, the fuel’s cost
may be higher over the long run. The power companies’ usage charge for
power is relatively cheap.
Calculate your alternative power costs over at least a ten-year span. When cal-
culating, you may want to consider the environmental cost savings of clean air
and clean water.
Power from two or more environmentally friendly sources can be combined.
Figure 15-2 shows a general diagram for charging batteries with solar and
wind power, as well as with a backup generator. You can control the generator
automatically to start when the battery voltage is below 11 volts on a 12-volt
244
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

battery bank. If the wind and solar sources can supply the load and keep the
battery voltage above 11 volts, you need to start the generator only to test
reliability and for maintenance.
External combustion steam systems
Another method of producing power is by steam. Most utilities use steam to
produce their power. Their power plants may use nuclear power, oil, coal, or
wood to produce steam, which then drives steam turbines. With the cost of
traditional fuels escalating we would not be surprised to see steam power
used in some home power systems in the future. The steam boiler could be
fired by virtually anything that burns. The exhaust steam from the turbine
could also be used to heat the house. But for now, home steam power sys-
tems are a thing of the future.

Internal combustion systems
The most common type of backup system is a generator running on an inter-
nal combustion engine. For homes, these generators typically range in size
from 4 kWto 25 kW. Some are portable units so you can drag it out of the
garage and hook it up temporarily during an outage. Others may be perma-
nent and start automatically during an outage, although you usually have a
lag time between when the power goes out and the generator starts. The
most efficient internal combustion generators run on diesel fuel, although
propane or natural gas-fueled units are more common.
Diesel fuel deteriorates with age. This happens with gasoline-powered gener-
ators, too. Some fuel additives can extend diesel’s or gasoline’s shelf life, but
this means added expense and maintenance. If your area typically only has
infrequent, short-duration power outages, then a natural gas or propane gen-
erator probably makes more sense.
Color Plate 10 (turn to the color insert pages in this book) shows an 80-kW
Katolight backup generator. This unit is a bit larger than most, which allows
you to see more detail. This generator is controlled by an automatic transfer
switch, which is described in the next section.
Interfacing Backup Systems
to Your Electrical System
The easiest way to interface a backup power source is to simply unplug your
refrigerator or lamp from the wall and plug it into the backup generator. But
this isn’t very convenient, so in this section we describe how to interface
directly between a backup system and your home’s electrical system.
If your backup system connects directly to your regular electrical system, the
interface must be interlocked so that the backup can’t connect to the utility’s
system and back feed electricity. Back feeding power into the utility’s distribu-
tion system could kill or injure a lineman trying to restore your power. The util-
ity company may want to approve the interface to ensure the interlock is fail
safe. Make sure the interface is installed by a qualified, experienced electrician.
Some manual transfer switches meet the interlock requirement. A manual
switch usually costs less than $200 and only connects to a few of the home’s
electrical circuits. One popular unit uses two breakers to energize a separate
standby panel. One breaker connects to the generator, and the other to the
utility power. The breakers are mechanically interlocked so that turning on
one breaker turns off the other one.
246
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Whole-house manual transfer switches are also available. Install these between
the meter socket and the home distribution panel. The transfer switch has the
same current rating as the electrical service, which is generally 100 or 200
amps. A whole-house manual transfer switch is rare because of its expense,
and an automatic transfer switch doesn’t cost that much more.
Automatic switches are nice because as the name implies, they start the gen-
erator and switch to the backup power source automatically when there’s an
outage. Two types of automatic transfer switch installations are possible:
 Circuit-specific: This type of switch installation, shown in Figure 15-3,
usually switches power to a separate standby panel when the normal
power goes out. The standby panel has circuits for some critical loads,
but not for the whole house.

Chapter 15: Backup and Alternative Power

 Whole house: Surprise! This type of switch installation, shown in
Figure 15-4, transfers the entire home’s electrical system over to back-
up power when necessary. This switch must have the same current
rating as the home’s electrical service. A 200-amp automatic transfer
switch costs about $500.
A service-transfer switch — whether manual or automatic — must be listed
by Underwriters Laboratory and marked as, “Suitable for Use as Service
Equipment.” This marking (often abbreviated SUSE) is sometimes referred to
as a Susie label.
Alternative Energy Systems
Some alternative energy sources — such as solar or wind — don’t have to
just be for emergencies. You can use them every single day to reduce your
utility bill or provide electricity where utility service isn’t available.

248
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 

Alternative power systems usually have more than one means of generating
electricity. Most are equipped with a solar array (more than one solar panel
grouped to work together). Although the solar panels are expensive, they
also have three outstanding advantages:
 Solar panels are silent because they have no moving parts.
 Solar panels are relatively maintenance free.
 Solar panels have a long life.
Wind-powered generators are also available, but are sometimes noisy, poten-
tially hazardous to birds, and require some maintenance. Whether you have a
wind generator or solar panels, the power source charges batteries. The bat-
teries may be 12-volt or 24-volt units, and are arranged in a battery bank that
powers an inverter. The inverter provides the home with 120-volt AC power.
If you’re building a home and plan to install a battery bank and inverter,
install it near the beginning of construction. Without an inverter and battery
bank, you’ll be running a generator all day, every day to provide power for
construction activities. With the inverter and battery bank installed, the gen-
erator only has to run three or four hours a day to provide round-the-clock
power. This spares you from the noise, fuel cost, and generator wear.
Choosing an inverter
Inverters convert the DC power stored in batteries to the AC power that most
household appliances need. Inverters for alternative power systems typically
range from 500 watts to 5,000 watts. A 500W inverter powers just a few lights
and receptacles. The 5,000W inverter can handle the whole house. Inverters
typically cost about $1 per watt. Popular voltages for inverter inputs are 12-
and 24-volt DC. Better-quality inverters are always vigilant and have a search
mode that conserves power. At least one manufacturer’s inverter can connect
to a second inverter in series, giving you 120-/240-volt power like most utility
companies provide.
Usually a generator is connected directly through the inverter. But if you
install a manual bypass switch, you can connect your electrical system to the
generator in case the inverter fails.
Caring for batteries
If the weather’s nasty for a long time, you could run out of power if you rely
solely on solar or wind to charge your alternative power system’s batteries. For
249
Chapter 15: Backup and Alternative Power

this reason, it’s a good idea to also have a generator, just in case. In northern
climates, the generator can probably supply most of the power in winter. For
these northern applications, an 1,800-RPM water-cooled diesel generator is
usually the best choice because it provides longevity and efficiency. We recom-
mend installing a meter to monitor the batteries, and possibly an alarm that
automatically starts the generator when the batteries run low. Some inverters
include this feature.
Lead-acid storage batteries draw a lot of current while charging, especially
when the batteries are very discharged. This draw tapers off as the batteries
near full charge. This makes for poor efficiency when using a generator to
fully charge batteries. On the other hand, the batteries become sulfated if
they aren’t topped off (fully charged) every couple of months. This sulfation
permanently robs some of the battery’s ability to store a charge. As the bat-
tery discharges, the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) combines with the lead (PB), leav-
ing lead sulphate (PbSO4) and water (H2O). If left discharged for three months
or more, the PbSO4 becomes set and the SO4 doesn’t completely recombine
with the H2O to get H2SO4.
250
Part IV: Security and Safety Systems 
Battery talk
Four 6-volt batteries connected in series add up
to 24 volts. A large-capacity 2-volt battery may
be two to three times larger than a car battery
and weigh more than 200 pounds. A 2-volt, 2,000
ampere-hour battery can cost about $600.
Ampere-hour is a battery’s capacity rating —
how much charge it can hold. A typical auto-
mobile battery has a 100 ampere-hour rating. A
battery’s capacity is proportional to the number
of plates or amount of plate area immersed in
the acid inside the battery. In most cases this
means a higher-capacity battery is also physi-
cally bigger. We say “in most cases” because
some batteries have very large voids in the
bottom. Manufacturers may advertise this as an
extra-large sediment chamber.
A battery’s state of charge is measured by a
hydrometer or refractometer. A hydrometer
costs about $15, and a refractometer costs
about $100. A refractometer — shown in the fol-
lowing figure — is more accurate and much
easier to use than a hydrometer. These instru-
ments measure the specific gravity of the bat-
tery’s electrolyte. The specific gravity of
electrolyte in a fully charged lead-acid battery is
1.265. A dead battery has a specific gravity of
1.190. Specific gravities are ratio comparisons of
the material’s density compared to pure water,
which has a specific gravity of 1.0. Reichert,
which is online at www.reichert.com,
makes refractometers.

Chapter 15: Backup and Alternative Power
Batteries come in these common voltages:
 2 volts
 6 volts
 12 volts
If your power system will be inactive for long periods — for example, your
mountainside cabin sits vacant for weeks at a time — a single solar panel can
do an excellent job of topping off the batteries and thus reducing or eliminat-
ing sulfation.
While charging and especially while equalizing, batteries give off hydrogen
(H) gas. (Equalizing is the process of fully charging a battery.) Hydrogen, the
lightest gas in the universe, is colorless, odorless, and flammable when mixed
with air in concentrations of 4 to 75 percent. In concentrations of 15 to 59
percent it’s highly explosive. While equalizing, keep the batteries vented and
don’t smoke near them. Just the spark from disconnecting a booster cable
from an automobile battery while it’s charging can blow up the battery, as
many folks have unfortunately discovered.
A lead-acid battery stored at room temperature will completely self-discharge
in about three months. Because chemical reactions slow down at lower tem-
peratures, a battery stored at 0°Fwill barely show any discharge after being
stored for a year. A fully charged battery will freeze at –75°F, while a half-
charged battery with a specific gravity of 1200 will freeze at –17°F. So, while
batteries hold a charge longer at lower temperatures, they also perform
better at warm temperatures (to a point; if battery temperature reaches
125°F, the battery may be ruined).
Store a fully charged battery outside in the cold or in a freezer. If you store
the battery outside, remember to disconnect one of the cables. You may have
heard an old wives’ tale about placing a battery on a board to store it; this
isn’t necessary.
When you’re dealing with lead-acid batteries, remember that acid is in — and
sometimes on — the battery case. If battery acid (also called electrolyte) gets
on your skin, simply wash it off with water. If you don’t wash it off, your skin
will become reddened. Acid can burn a hole in your clothes. However, if the
acid gets in your eyes, the damage will be much more extensive. Remember
to always wear eye protection when handling battery electrolyte.
Electrolyte is diluted sulfuric acid, which is colorless and odorless, and thus
easily mistaken for water. You can neutralize sulfuric acid with baking soda. If
a battery looks wet, find out if sulfuric acid is present before you handle the
battery by sprinkling baking soda on the wet surface. If the moisture contains
sulfuric acid, the baking soda will produce a neutralization reaction that can
be seen as a fizz.

S
ome people like to go outside to get away from all the high-tech complex-
ities of modern life. Some people want to be out in the beautiful weather
but are stuck inside, working.
Your digital home doesn’t have to end at the exterior walls. If you wish to
extend the value and enjoyment of technology to the outdoors, this chapter
is for you. Installing some basic wiring for power and other electronic conve-
niences is easy. In this chapter, we show you how to install devices and
wiring in sunrooms, open areas, gardens, outbuildings, and more.
Powering Sunrooms
Sunrooms — also commonly called screened-in porches, patio enclosures, and
Florida rooms — are indoor/outdoor rooms with these features:
 Coverage by the house’s roof
 One or more doors to the main house
 One or more doors to a deck, patio, or yard

Typically, two or three walls are shared with the main house and are covered
by stucco or other siding material; the other wall(s) are screened, sometimes
glassed in, and may have one or more sliding glass doors. The floor in the
sunroom may be concrete, teak wood, or outdoor carpeting. To meet electri-
cal code, sunrooms are considered outdoor spaces because at least one side
is open to the elements (or only separated from the weather by screens).
Sunrooms allow you to enjoy the outdoor breeze without the bugs, they pro-
vide a place for children to play, and they’re a nice place to eat in the fresh
air. The following sections show you how to wire sunrooms.
Installing power and lighting
You can run wiring in sunrooms much like indoor wiring. Use Romex nonmetal-
lic cable for the wiring on shared walls (walls shared with the main house). You
can feed light switches for the sunroom with Romex if the switches are inside
the home and not in the screened area. Protect switches in the sunroom with
weatherproof covers (or weatherproof boxes with weatherproof covers) in the
non-shared walls. The wiring to weather-exposed switches must be under-
ground feeder (UF) cable, conduit with rain-tight fittings, or PVC conduit.
Other electrical components in the sunroom also need special consideration:
 Lighting fixtures: The fixtures should be marked for use in damp loca-
tions. Any fixtures marked for use in wet locations can also be used
here. Most recessed fixtures are suitable for use in damp locations, but
always check the specifications to be sure.
 Electrical receptacles: Any receptacles mounted on an exterior house
wall can use indoor wiring methods (such as Romex) but must be pro-
tected by weatherproof covers. Electrical receptacles installed on
exposed walls must be fed by UF cable or conduit. The receptacles must
have weatherproof covers and be GFI protected.
 Circuit loading: If you’re only considering a few light fixtures, you can
power them from one of the house circuits. If you only have a few recep-
tacles, you can connect them to the exterior outlet circuit. However, if the
sunroom has a lot of outlets or you plan to install appliances that draw a
lot of current, run a separate circuit from the panel just for this area.
 Electrical devices and appliances: A lot of the equipment and appliances
popular in sunrooms aren’t rated for damp-area use. These items may
include TVs, computers, radios, and electric grills. Move these things into
the house on rainy days, or at least cover and unplug them.
256
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

Bringing entertainment to the sunroom
For fun in the shade, you may want to bring some of your electronic enter-
tainment and communication systems out to the sunroom.
Consider first the audio speakers. Ideally, you should use weatherproof
speakers in any exposed area. However, because weather exposure in a sun-
room should be minimal, you can get away with installing standard speakers
if you recess them a few inches from the surface of the ceiling. Keep the
speakers; make sure the speaker installation area doesn’t get damp.
If you want to install an intercom in your sunroom (see Chapter 7 for more on
intercom systems), use the same type of station designed for exposed door-
answering units. These units are inexpensive and weather resistant. Mount
the intercom unit flush in a common wall with the house, and wire to it using
standard indoor wiring.
You can install TV cable outlets, network drops, and phone outlets in sun-
rooms if you do so on a common wall with the house. Again, use standard
indoor wiring. You must also install weatherproof plates on these recepta-
cles. If the installation location is exposed to the elements, use wire such as
underground feeder (UF), which is approved for damp locations. The boxes
should be weatherproof as well.
Electrifying Patios and Decks
Patios and decks don’t usually have roofs, and they may only share one wall
with the house, if not be completely detached from the home. Because of the
increased exposure, wiring to patios and decks is a little more challenging
than wiring a sunroom. But don’t let the added challenge stop you from
adding some power outlets or lighting to your decks and patios! At a bare
minimum you will probably want an electrical outlet to plug in a griddle or
rotisserie for the gas grill.
If the patio is adjacent to the house, the easiest solution for power is to use
GFI-protected receptacles on an exterior house wall. If the patio is away from
the house or the layout requires power at the patio’s outside edge, follow
these steps:
1. Run UF Romex underground from the house to the receptacle location.
The Romex should be buried at least 18". The wire can be directly buried.
257
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

2. Install a 4" × 4" treated post in the ground on which to mount the
receptacle.
For detailed installation, see the text accompanying Figure 16-1. If you
can use an existing post, such as a roof or deck rail support, you don’t
need to install one.
3. Mount a weatherproof box on the post (or on the existing roof or deck
railing).
The wire from the switch to the light in Figure 16-1 goes out the back
of the weatherproof switch box via a hole drilled through the post at
a downward angle. The angle prevents water from running into the
switch box.
4. Install PVC conduit from the box down to below grade, and run the
wire through the conduit up to the box.
5. Install a GFI receptacle in the box, and use a waterproof outlet 
cover.
In addition to a power receptacle, you may want to include some lighting for
your deck or patio. If you have a roof overhead, you may want follow the sun-
room example and use recessed lighting on a dimmer switch. Just make sure
that any switch you use on a deck or patio is equipped with a weatherproof
cover.
An inexpensive yet very functional installation is shown in Figure 16-1. Here, a
simple 4" × 4" treated post has been installed with two receptacles and a light
fixture next to a picnic area at a remote cottage. The mostly transparent “in
use” cover is open to show the two receptacles. The wire is then stapled to
the back of the post, out of site in this view. Through another hole drilled at
an upward angle, the wire enters the light fixture’s box. A PVC conduit pro-
tects the UF Romex to about 1' underground. For stability, the 4" × 4" post
extends about 2' into the ground. The light fixture has a base slightly wider
than the post, making it necessary to install a square piece of treated ply-
wood so that the fixture fits flush.
To stabilize the 4" × 4" post in Figure 16-1, a 3'-long treated 2" × 6" board is fas-
tened horizontally to the post with galvanized or stainless-steel screws, form-
ing a T. The 2" × 6" is buried just a few inches below grade. This makes for a
very stable installation once all the holes are backfilled. This stabilization
method saves you from having to buy and mix concrete. Use a bubble level to
make sure the 4" × 4" is straight before backfilling.

Lighting Your Garden
Gardens don’t have to be enjoyed exclusively in daylight. With some accent
lighting you can beautify your yard and gardens at night as well. Garden
lights are usually powered by either solar cells or electrical power. Shop
around to see which type fits your needs and budget. In this section, we
focus on low-voltage lights that run on electrical power, because those lights
require special wiring consideration.
Most garden lights are 12 volts. This means that your system must have a
transformer that transforms the 120/240-volt power from your house to the
12-volt power used by the lights. As you plan your garden lighting, you have
to select a transformer that can handle the load that the system uses. To plan
and install your garden lighting, follow these steps:
1. Select a transformer that can handle more than the total load of all
your lights.
Most garden light fixtures range from 4 to 50 watts per light. Add up the
total wattage required by all the lights, and then choose a transformer
Figure 16-1:
This
installation
brings light
and power
to an
outdoor
area.
259
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

with a higher-rated capacity. Also, make sure you choose a transformer
designed for damp areas; most garden-light transformers are rated for
weather exposure.
An oversized transformer doesn’t cost any more money to operate. A
1,000-watt transformer with 200W of lighting connected to it draws close
to the 200W load. We recommend limiting the load on the transformer to
a maximum of 80 percent of its rated wattage capacity.
2. Choose low-voltage wiring that can handle the amperage drawn by
your lights.
At 12 volts, a 50W lamp draws 4.2 amps. Self-sealing, moisture-resistant,
low-voltage cable comes in the following sizes and the maximum wattage
for each is shown here:
• 16 AWG: 150 watts maximum
• 14 AWG: 200 watts maximum
• 12 AWG: 300 watts maximum
Total up the wattage as you wire in the lamps, being careful not to
exceed the wire’s rated capacity. Each pair of wires can power as many
lamps as you like, but don’t go over the wire’s or transformer’s capacity.
3. Install the wiring between the transformer and lights.
For large lamp loads, run several wires to groups of lights or install mul-
tiple transformers.
Low-voltage garden-light wiring has no minimum burial depth. You can
run it on the surface, but consider burying it at least a few inches for
appearance and safety. When burying the wire, run it where you’re not
going to damage it while tending your garden. Running the wire next to
the building or along the sidewalk edge may help you remember where it
is many months after installation. You may want to diagram the wiring,
especially if someone else ever helps pick weeds.
4. Connect the transformer to a GFI-protected, weatherproof outlet.
How are you going to control those lights? You can turn garden lights on and
off manually, with timers, or with light sensors. See Chapter 5 for more on
controls and automation.
Delivering Electricity to Outbuildings
Most outbuildings fall into one of two popular categories: unattached garages
and pole barns. Pole barns tend to have dirt or gravel floors, while garages usu-
ally have cement floors. But no matter what kind of outbuilding you have — a
guest cottage, office, studio, or yurt — running power to outbuildings on your
property must be done carefully, especially if you plan to run high-load equip-
ment like compressors, air conditioners, and welders in the building.
260
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

As with a house electrical service (see Chapter 2), you must be able to turn
off outbuilding power with six or fewer hand operations. You can bring power
to outbuildings numerous ways; we cover five of these. Each method is
defined by the size and type of wire used to feed the service. The five meth-
ods follow. See Chapter 2 for definitions of wire types.
 12-2 or 10-2 with ground UF Romex: Run from the house panel to a
single-pole switch for the outbuilding, and then wire from that switch to
the building’s lighting and receptacles. The single-pole switch satisfies
the disconnect requirement. The burial depth for 12-2 or 10-2 UF Romex
is a minimum of 12" below grade when fed from a 20-amp GFI circuit. If
the circuit isn’t GFI protected, the burial depth must be at least 18". The
maximum power available from this method is only 2,400 watts.
 12-3 or 10-3 UF with ground Romex: Run from the house panel to a two-
pole switch for the outbuilding, and then wire from the switch to the
lighting, receptacles, and equipment powering the building. The two-
pole switch satisfies the disconnect requirement. An 18" burial depth is
required. For this option, the feeder is 20-amp, 240-volt service fed from
a two-pole breaker in the house panel. Maximum power available from
this method is increased to 4,800 watts.
In either of the preceding options, you can use a 30-amp breaker for the
outbuilding if the feeder wire is 10 AWG. If the feeder is 30 amp, you
must put a breaker panel in the outbuilding with either 15- or 20-amp
breakers to supply the lighting and outlets. 14 AWG or 12 AWG wire
should supply the circuits within the outbuilding; 10 AWG feeder wire
has less voltage drop than smaller-gauge wire.
 2/2/4 or 2/2/2 Underground Residential Distribution (URD) aluminum
cable: Run this cable from the house panel to a service panel in the out-
building. The outbuilding panel usually has a 100-amp rating. The panel
has to be either a main lug panel with fewer than six circuit breakers, or a
panel with a main disconnect to satisfy the disconnect requirement. The
neutral connection bar in this panel must be bonded (using the supplied
bond screw) to panel. You must ground this panel by connecting it to the
water piping (if present) and with ground rods as detailed in Chapter 2.
The URD cable must be run in PVC or rigid conduit in any exposed areas.
An 18" burial depth is required for direct burial cable. Maximum power
available from this method is a whopping 24,000 watts.
The panel in the house that feeds the outbuilding panel should have a
two-pole breaker on the feeder line. This breaker should be rated for
100 amps or fewer. We generally use a 40-, 50-, or 60-amp breaker. These
sizes accommodate 2 AWG wire and cost about the same. Of course 70-,
80-, 90-, or 100-amp breakers also accommodate 2 AWG wire, but each
one is progressively more expensive. Use a larger breaker only if you
need that much power.
 4/0-4/0-2/0 or 4/0-4/0-4/0 URD aluminum cable: Like the preceding
option, this involves a run from the house panel to a service panel in 
the garage or outbuilding. All of the grounding and cable-protection 
261
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

provisions mentioned for 2/2/4 and 2/2/2 runs apply here as well. A
panel fed by 4/0-4/0-2/0 or 4/0-4/0-4/0 URD cable has a 150- or 200-amp
rating. The feeder breakers in sizes larger than 100 amps use four spaces
in the house panel. Maximum power available from this method is a
watt-hour meter spinning 48,000 watts.
 Overhead or underground service installed on the garage or outbuild-
ing: You can have electric service installed directly to the outbuilding,
as described for residences in Chapter 2. In some cases this is the only
electric service on the property, and the house is powered from the out-
building. If the utility service connects to your outbuilding first, in the
outbuilding install a feed-through panel rated at 125, 150, or 200 amps.
Maximum power available from this method is 48,000 watts.
Figure 16-2 shows conduit passing through the home’s perimeter framing and
down the side of the home’s foundation. The conduit ends between a few
inches and a foot underground. On the outbuilding, the wiring normally
doesn’t run on the exterior — you bring it up through a piece of conduit in
the building floor as shown in Figure 16-2. A 90-degree sweep elbow brings
the cable up from its horizontal run. Install this conduit prior to pouring any
foundation slab. The conduit can range in size from 3⁄4" to 2", depending on
the wire feeder you use.
If you use the last wiring option given in the preceding bulleted list (the 4/0
option), you may use a 200-amp, eight circuit, weatherproof Square D like the
one shown in Figure 16-3. Square D makes this panel in 125-, 150-, and 200-amp
sizes. Notice the two large feed-through lugs on the bottom of the black
removable interior. These lugs are connected to the incoming large lugs on
top through the 200-amp breaker. The incoming and outgoing neutrals are
connected to the two center lugs on top. This outbuilding panel is fed directly
from the utility company through an overhead or underground meter socket
to the panel.
Retrofitting power to existing outbuildings
It’s possible to retrofit electrical service in an existing outbuilding, although
the installation obviously isn’t as easy as with new construction. Your first
challenge is getting power into the outbuilding. If the building has a concrete
floor, you have to use a large roto-hammer to drill a hole in the concrete to
accommodate the feeder wire.
It isn’t necessary to install a conduit in the drilled hole through the concrete,
but a conduit should start where the wire protrudes from the concrete.
Stabilize the conduit by fastening a hub to the concrete or to a piece of
treated lumber into which you have drilled a hole to accommodate the con-
duit. Fasten the treated lumber to the floor using concrete nails or anchor
bolts, or by using a power driver.

Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

Wiring in workshops
Believe it or not, the National Electrical Code doesn’t specify where your out-
lets should be and how many you should have in garages and outbuildings.
We suggest the following for installing outlets:
 Garage: Install at least one receptacle on each wall, except for the wall
with the garage door.
 Workshop: In a work area (whether in a garage or a separate outbuild-
ing), install several outlets or a couple of quad-density outlets per wall.
You may also want to include some 15- or 20-amp 120-volt combination
receptacles.
Some 120-volt equipment draws more than 12 amps; they have 20-amp plugs.
The maximum draw for a tool or appliance is 80 percent of the connecting
cord’s rating. Eighty percent of 15 amps is 12 amps, and 80 percent of 20 amps
is 16 amps. Any 120-volt device requiring more than 1,440 watts (12 amps ×
120 volts) must use a 20-amp rated or larger plug, or it may use 240 volts.
All 15- and 20-amp 120-volt receptacles in garages and outbuildings must be
GFI protected. The receptacle for the garage door opener is exempt from this
requirement.
If you plan to use any 240-volt equipment, install 15- or 20-amp combination
receptacles fed by 12-2 Romex. Figure 16-4 shows a 240-volt 15/20-amp duplex
receptacle. The 240-volt receptacle is on the left. The receptacle in the middle
is a standard 15-amp, 120-volt receptacle, and the receptacle on the right is a
120-volt 15/20-amp combination receptacle. This type of 120-volt receptacle is
easily confused with the 240-volt receptacle because they’re mirror images of
each other. Also shown in Figure 16-4 are the four cord-matching end configu-
rations that plug into each receptacle.
Sizing conductors for welders in workshops
If you plan to do any welding in your workshop, you have some wiring deci-
sions to make. Welders have current multipliers that allow reducing the size
of the conductors that feed them. This multiplier is based on the welder’s
duty cycle. Most consumer welders have a duty cycle of 20 percent. The cur-
rent multiplier for a welder with a 20-percent duty cycle is .45.
For calculating welder supply conductors using the electrical code’s allow-
able derating multipliers, you need the following:
Name Plate Current Rating × Derating Multiplier =
Allowable Conductor Current Rating
264
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

For example, if the name plate rating on a welder with a 20-percent duty cycle
is 50 amps, you multiply the 50 amps times .45 to get 22.5 amps. The conduc-
tor size for 22.5 amps is 12 AWG wire. The 75°C current rating for 12 AWG
wire is 25 amps. This size wire is the minimum.
The welder’s duty cycle is determined by the manufacturer and is required to
be indicated on the electrical rating tag or name plate. The duty cycle is the
number of minutes in a ten-minute period that the welder can produce cur-
rent without overheating. A 20-percent–rated welder can be used two min-
utes out of ten.
The code allows you to use a circuit breaker as large as 200 percent of the
welder’s rated primary current. You can use a breaker in the range of 20 to
100 amps in the panel feeding the 12 AWG wire to the welder receptacle. The
welder receptacle would be rated 50 amps to accommodate the factory-
installed 50-amp plug. The code allows this plug and receptacle to be the
15 amp 240 volt
20 amp 240 volt
15 amp 120 volt
20 amp 120 volt
Figure 16-4:
These 120-
and 240-volt
receptacles

common).
265
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

same amperage capacity as the conductor, so if you’re supplying your own
cord end (plug), you could use a 20-amp plug. On this installation we suggest
using wire a little heaver than the minimum allowed and using a much
smaller breaker than the maximum permitted. The welder would have a 10
AWG wire fed with a 40- or 50-amp breaker.
Using a breaker that’s too large can be dangerous. In Color Plate 15 (shown
in the color insert pages in this book), the tip of a soldering gun has been
replaced by a piece of 12 AWG wire. I pulled the trigger and measured the
current with a clamp-on ammeter. Initially the current was about 115 amps,
but in a few seconds it had dropped to 98.1 amps, as shown in the figure.
Although the trigger was only on for a few seconds, the wire was too hot to
touch. You want the circuit breaker to trip long before the wire is heated to
the point where its insulation is destroyed. Most breakers trip in about an
hour if just slightly overloaded, and that’s plenty of time to protect the wire
if the breaker rating is 200 percent or less of the conductor rating. Carrying
100 amps on a 12 AWG wire is 400 percent of the conductor rating.
Sizing conductors for air compressors in workshops
If your work requires an air compressor, some wiring decisions are in your
future. Compressors also have a current multiplier to determine the conduc-
tor current rating.
Unlike welders, using these multipliers is mandatory. Use this formula for a
compressor:
Name Plate Full Load Current × 125 Percent = Current Wire
Rating
For example, the full load current rating of a 5 HP compressor is 28 amps. To
calculate the proper conductor current rating, you multiply the 28 amps
times 1.25; you get 35 amps. The 75°C rating of 10 AWG wire is 35 amps. A 10
AWG wire is the minimum conductor in this case. The circuit breaker rating
can be as much as 250 percent of the name plate full load current rating. In
this case, we have 28 amps times 2.50, giving us 70. You could use a maxi-
mum of a 70-amp breaker on this compressor.
Sometimes you need the larger breaker on a motor to prevent false tripping
from the motor’s high starting current. In this case we suggest using a 60-amp
breaker because it’s more common than the 70-amp breaker, and the 70-amp
breaker costs twice as much. Square D breakers sized from 15 to 60 amps are
the same price.
266
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

Lighting outbuildings
You’re probably going to want to install some lighting inside and outside your
outbuilding, whether it’s a garage or pole barn.
If your detached garage has power, code requires you to have a switch-
controlled light that illuminates the exterior of the entrance door, sometimes
referred to as the man door. (The code doesn’t consider an overhead garage
door to be an entrance door.) This outside fixture is typically a coach light.
The required switch for the exterior lights may also control the interior lights
if you wish.
You have some options when it comes to choosing interior light fixtures:
 Porcelain lamp with an incandescent bulb
 Fluorescent tube
Fluorescent lights usually give better light and are more energy efficient.
If you install florescent lights in an outbuilding in colder climates, use high-
output florescent fixtures with low-temperature ballasts. We recommend
florescent fixtures that hold two high-output 8' lamps. Four of these fixtures
installed in a 24' × 24' building gives an average lighting intensity level of
80 footcandles at the floor. (1 footcandle is equal to the light intensity from
a burning candle at a distance of 1'.) Eighty footcandles is plenty for most
uses. See Chapter 10 for more about lighting.
To control your lighting, you may want to install a three-way switch between
the house and the outbuilding. You can leave the switch on to light your way
to the house at night. We describe three-way light switches in Chapter 4, but
because you’re wiring between the house and an outbuilding, you must take
into account two special considerations:
 Run a three-conductor UF cable between the switch box in the house
and the lighting circuit in the outbuilding. Alternatively, you could install
an X10-style remote control, as described in Chapter 5.
 Code requires that you be able to turn off all power in the outbuilding at
its service disconnect location. Any three-way outbuilding switches in
the house must receive power from an outbuilding circuit, not from a
house circuit. You can meet this code requirement in the house if the
home-service disconnect kills the outbuilding power. If the house and
outbuilding are fed from independent services, one of the three-way
switches is going to bring power to one of the buildings that can’t be
turned off by killing the power to that building. This three-way switch
should be plainly marked that it receives power independently. This
alerts workmen that the switch remains energized even if this building’s
power is turned off.
267
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

Installing network, phone, 
TV, and intercom service
Just because your outbuilding is away from the house doesn’t mean you have
to forgo things like telephone, computer networks, cable TV, and intercoms.
When adding any of these communications systems to your outbuilding,
follow these installation tips:
 Use direct burial UF-rated communications cables for the runs between
your house and the outbuilding.
 You can bury the communications cable in the same trench as power
wires; however, at least 1' of separation should be between the power
wires and other low-voltage wires. The low-voltage communication wires
are installed after partially backfilling the trench over the electrical
power wires.
 If you install the wires in conduit, use rigid, IMC, or PVC conduit. PVC
conduit is the cheapest and easiest to work with.
Even if you use a conduit, the wiring must be rated for direct burial
because conduit isn’t considered waterproof.
 All low-voltage systems can share the same conduit with each other, but
never include the low-voltage wires in the same conduit as the electrical
feeds.
For network, phone, TV, and intercom wiring inside the outbuilding, follow
the same rough-in procedures used for in-home installations. You may use
burial-rated wire for interior installations in outbuildings.
Wiring for sheds
In potting or storage sheds, you may need to use any or all of the following
devices:
 Vacuum cleaner
 Small power tools
 Task lighting
 Fixed or overhead lighting
 Dehumidifier or heater
 Refrigerator
Many of the very small buildings would be adequately served by using 12-2
or 10-2 with ground UF Romex to run from the house panel to a single-pole
switch for the outbuilding, and then wiring from that switch to the building’s
268
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

lighting and receptacles. This wiring option is covered in the “Delivering
Electricity to Outbuildings” section, earlier in this chapter.
Sometimes, you’re faced with the dilemma of having to run two pieces of
equipment simultaneously and wondering if a single 20-amp circuit will be
enough. As we stated earlier in this chapter, any electrical item with a stan-
dard 15-amp plug draws a maximum of 80 percent of 12 or 15 amps. By plug-
ging in two items that draw the maximum 12 amps, you have 24 amps on the
20-amp breaker feeding this usage. In this example, the breaker may trip after
30 minutes to 1 hour, or it may never trip. The breaker does protect the cir-
cuit conductors, so trying this isn’t problematic if tripping a breaker is just a
nuisance. If you recognize this challenge in the design stage, we recommend
bringing in enough power to handle all the loads with some capacity to spare.
Installing Saunas
Saunas generally have two rooms: one for changing and the other for steaming.
Some designs may also include a third room for a shower. Figure 16-5 shows a
typical sauna layout including a shower and toilet in separate rooms. This
sample layout has ventilation fans in the shower and in the changing room.
Individual switches, separate from the lighting switches, control these fans.
The sauna building needs circuits for lighting and receptacles, as well as a cir-
cuit for an electric sauna stove. The best way to accomplish this is to install a
separate 100-amp service panel for the sauna building, as described earlier in
this chapter.
The steam portion of a sauna can involve temperatures of 145°F to 194°F.
Some people like to run from a sauna and jump into cold water or roll in
some snow for a fast cool down, while others prefer a slower cool-down
period. Although saunas have been used and enjoyed since about the year
1100 across many cultures, high temperatures and extreme temperature
changes are unsafe for some people. Before building, buying, and using a
sauna, check with your physician to make sure that a sauna is safe for you.
Selecting a sauna stove
The size of the circuit you need for the sauna stove depends on the stove’s
current rating. The stove size — expressed in kilowatts (KW) — depends on
the steam room cubic volume. A 6' × 8' room that has an 8'-high ceiling has a
volume of 384 cubic feet. You need about 1 KW for every 50 cubic feet of
room volume. In this example, a 384-cubic-foot room needs 7.68 KW, so you
should choose a sauna stove with a rating of 7 or 8 KW. Choosing the right
size stove is an important step in planning your sauna. An improperly sized
stove will be difficult, if not impossible, to properly control.
269
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

For our 384-cubic-foot sauna, we chose a 7.5 KW ILO-brand stove made by
A&L Fabricating of Dollar Bay, Michigan. The manufacturer says this stove
will service a sauna steam room from 217 to 420 cubic feet. Dividing 7,500
watts (7.5 KW) by the circuit voltage of 240 equals a 31.25-amp load. Because
this is a continuous load, we must multiply the current times 125 percent to
determine the conductor size. 125 percent of 31.25 amps is 39 amps. This
means that a 40-amp breaker and 8 AWG should be used to supply the stove.
Here are the formulas to plug into:
Stove Wattage ÷ Circuit Voltage = Amp Load
Current × 125 Percent = Conductor Size
Any load expected to be on for three hours or more is considered continuous.

Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

Supplying power
The sauna building should use a 6-circuit, 120/240-volt, 100-amp electrical
panel. The panel should have a two-pole 40-amp circuit for the sauna stove, a
15-amp lighting circuit, and a 20-amp receptacle circuit. To install the panel
and electrical service, follow these general steps:
1. Install the electrical panel flush with the closet wall with the front of
the panel facing the changing room.
In these steps, we assume the layout for the sauna you’re constructing is
similar to the one shown in Figure 16-5.
2. Place the stove’s contactor in the closet.
The contactor is a control relay that provides power to the sauna stove’s
heating element when the digital thermostat calls for more heat. The
contactor is supplied with a painted enclosure. Mounting the contactor
in the closet makes it easy to run 8-3 Romex from the electrical panel to
the 4" × 4" box in the steam room that the stove is wired to. This box
needs a two-gang plaster ring with a raise to match the wall finish.
Mount the box about 1' above the floor behind the sauna stove. Both the
box and the plaster ring should be metal to ensure a good ground on the
stainless steel plate that you install when connecting the stove later.
3. Connect high-temperature wire between the contactor and the stove’s
heating elements.
The stove manufacturer provides about 6' of high-temperature wire con-
nected to the heating elements and a ground wire. These wires come out
of a threaded hole in the lower part of the stove, near the base. The
wires are enclosed in about 2' of flexible, weatherproof metal conduit
(such as Sealtite) which you supply. Install a stainless-steel blank plate
on the plaster ring, and punch a hole through which to connect the
conduit.
4. Calculate the sauna’s lighting and receptacle load.
Consider the total volt amps (VA) for everything in the building. In the
example shown in this chapter we have a 288 square feet building. For a
sauna building, calculate the general building current load at 3 VA per
square foot. This gives a total load of 864 VA. With a 120/240-volt service,
divide the total volt amps by the 240 volts, which equals 3.6; then round
up to 4.0. This adds 4 amps to the feeder wires’ load. Adding the sauna
stove’s calculated load of 39 amps (from the preceding section) brings
the total load to 43 amps. To accommodate the 43-amp load, you need a
minimum of a 50-amp breaker to power the feeder to the sauna building.
271
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

Installing the sauna stove control
High-quality sauna stoves should include an electronic digital thermostatic
control. To complete installation of the sauna and controller, follow these
steps:
1. Install a three-gang electrical box outside the entrance to the steam
room to house the controller.
2. Run the low-voltage wiring for the controller between the stove’s con-
tactor and three-gang box.
The manufacturer should provide the control wiring with the stove.
3. Mount the thermistor in the steam room.
The thermistor (thermo-resistor) is a heat-reactive resistor that monitors
and reports the temperature to the stove control.
Figure 16-6 shows a 9-kilowatt ILO sauna stove, contactor, digital controller,
and coils of control wire. The controller is push-button with a digital readout.

Wiring near Pools and Hot Tubs
Homeowners don’t normally install their own pools. You may, however, want
to make some improvements to or near existing pools or hot tubs.
With all the aquatic frolicking that occurs in and around pools, it should
come as no surprise that electricity must follow stringent requirements near
pools:
 Anything electrical within 20' of a pool must be GFI protected.
 A GFI-protected receptacle must be in the pool area. The receptacle
must be at least 10' but not more than 20' from the pool wall.
 Any light switches in the pool area must be 5' or more from the pool, and
they must be GFI protected.
 No light fixtures are to be installed over a pool, or over a 5' border zone
around the pool.
 No sound equipment or speakers supplied by 120-volt power can be
located within 5' of a pool.
 Overhead service conductors must be at least 10' horizontally from the
edge of the pool walls.
Unlike pools, homeowners often install hot tubs. Regardless of where you
install your hot tub — on a deck, on a patio, or inside a building — some elec-
trical requirements must be met.
Some hot tubs are dual-voltage or triple-voltage rated. They operate on 120,
208, or 240 volts. Most hot tubs are actually 240-volt appliances, but if they
are supplied with less voltage, the heater capacity is reduced. Hot tub pumps
usually run on 120 volts. The heater element resistance is not linear. A heater
that draws 4 KW at 240 volts draws only about 1 KW at 120 volts. When calcu-
lating the electrical feeder requirements for the hot tub, you have to decide
what voltage to use and then check the manufacturer’s current rating for that
voltage. The tub manufacturer specifies the circuit size you need for each
allowable voltage.
Some hot tub manufacturers use two 120-volt, 2 KW heaters connected
in series, yielding a total draw of 240 volts. In 120-volt operation, only one
of these heaters is used. This gives the tub a 2 KW rating at 120 volts and 
a current draw of 16.6 amps. You must use a 20-amp, 120-volt GFI outlet
because the current exceeds the allowable for a standard 15-amp receptacle.
273
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

Once you determine the feeder size for your hot tub, you have to actually
install the feeder circuit. Special considerations follow:
 Regardless of the location of the tub, the wire must be rated for the
installation chosen.
 You must install a power disconnect for the tub. The disconnect must be
easily accessible and within sight of the hot tub; however, it must also
be at least 5' away from the tub.
 The tub circuit must be GFI protected unless the tub is certified to have
integral GFI protection.
 You may want 120-volt power near the tub for sound systems or weath-
erproof spa entertainment centers. Power and cable TV wiring must be
rated for outdoor use. AT least 5' must be between 120-volt receptacles
and the hot tub. As well, your entertainment equipment must also be at
least 5' away from the hot tub and must be GFI protected.
 Any receptacles located within 10' of the hot tub must be GFI protected.
Pumping Water on Your Property
If your home isn’t on a city water system, you probably have an electric well
pump supplying water pressure for your plumbing. You may also have other
kinds of water pumps around your property, such as those for garden water-
falls or built-up waste drain fields. The following sections introduce you to
the special issues you must consider when installing different kinds of water
pumps.
Powering well pumps
Submersible pumps are one of the few electrical installations that don’t
require a within-sight disconnect. Also, unlike most other wiring you do near
water, pump wiring isn’t GFI protected because of the likelihood of false trips.
The wire down the well casing to the pump is usually a twisted, open, water-
proof conductor supplied by the well-drilling company. The wire supplying
power to the pump runs to the pump along with the water supply line, and
the wiring enters the house with the supply line as well. A disconnect is
required at this location to service the pressure switch.
The wiring must suit the pump voltage, length of the run, and depth of the
installation. Short to moderate runs may use 12-2 or 10-2 UF Romex, but no
matter how long the run, you should carefully calculate the size needed.
Smaller wire causes more voltage drop. You want to keep the voltage drop to
less than 5 percent of the circuit voltage.
274
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

The formula for calculating voltage drop over copper wire follows:
(2 × Length in Feet) × Amps × 10.4 ÷ CMA = Voltage Drop
Multiply by 2 the length of the run in feet from the service panel in the house
all the way to the pump — including the run from the house to the pump, and
the wire running down the well to the pump itself. Now multiply this by the
pump’s amp rating, multiply by 10.4 (the voltage drop constant for copper
wire), and divide it all by the Circular Mill Area (CMA) of the wire. The CMA
for 12 AWG is 6,530. The CMA of 10 AWG is 10,380. For example, this is the cal-
culation for a 150' run to a 20-amp pump using 10 AWG wire:
(2 × 150) × 20 × 10.4 ÷ 10,380 = 6 volts
The calculation for a 150' run to a 20-amp pump using 12 AWG wire follows:
(2 × 150) × 20 × 10.4 ÷ 6,530 = 10 volts
A 240-volt 1⁄2 horsepower pump running at full load draws about 5 amps. The
full load starting current may be as high as 20 amps. If the total power run is
150', the voltage to the motor is reduced from the 240 to 230 volts with 12
AWG wire, or 234 volts with 10 AWG wire.
Figure 16-7 shows a typical wiring installation for a submersible pump with a
schematic diagram inserted on the left. Follow these steps to install the
wiring for your pump:
1. Run the UF Romex wire from the pump along the water supply line
though the wall to the location for the 4" × 4" box.
The wire should enter the house along with the water line and continue
unbroken to the pressure switch.
2. Mount a 4" × 4" box and pull the pump wire and the power wire from
the panel into the back of the box.
In Figure 16-7, a handy box has been used instead of a 4" × 4" box.
3. Install a 3⁄4" flexible conduit between the 4" × 4" and tank pressure
switch.
This conduit will contain the two wires from the pump, a pair of load
wires from the switch, and a ground wire.
4. Connect the wires from the pump and the load wires from the toggle
switch to the tank pressure switch.
The pressure switch turns the pump on when the water pressure
reaches the low-set level; it turns the pump off when the water pressure
reaches the high-set level. This action maintains the pressure within the
desired pounds per square inch (PSI) range. The pressure tank shown on
275
Chapter 16: Wiring Outside the House

the right in Figure 16-7 reduces the frequency of pump cycling. Because
the inlet and outlet are in the tank bottom, a volume of air is com-
pressed as the tank fills. This compressed air supplies the pressure until
the pressure drops below the low-pressure setting; then the pump turns
on again, repeating the process.
5. Connect the power wires from the panel and the load wires to the pres-
sure switch to the two-pole toggle switch mounted in the 4" × 4" box.
6. Connect the four ground wires together and install the toggle switch
mounted on the 4" × 4" raised cover.
If you can only see three ground wires, you forgot to add a ground pigtail
to ground the 4" × 4" box.
The two-pole switch turns the pump off for maintenance work or when you
don’t need it for long periods of time. During normal operation the tank pres-
sure switch turns the pump on and off to meet the demand for water.
If you look closely at the wiring diagram in Figure 16-7 you can see that if the
power-in wires and the pump wires are reversed, the system would still work.
That’s because there are two double-pole switches in series. If both switches
are on, the pump will work. However, hooking up the wiring backwards
defeats an important function of the switch, which is to cut off power to the
pressure switch for maintenance.

Installing garden and waterfall pumps
Small waterfall pumps are usually in small lined pools or 5-gallon plastic
buckets. The pumps are usually supplied with a 6' power cord.
To power a waterfall or other garden pump, install a GFI receptacle near
the pump location. You can install this receptacle on a short piece of treated
2" × 4" just above ground level. The receptacle should use a weatherproof
box and an in-use weatherproof cover. An in-use cover is hooded, keeping
the receptacle dry when the cord is plugged in. The circuit to this receptacle
should be supplied with 12-2 UF Romex.
As with other garden wiring, code requires a burial depth of at least 12" for
pump receptacles if the conductors are protected by a GFI, and 18" if not pro-
tected by a GFI. This prevents the wire from being damaged by power tillers
or other garden tools.
You may also want to light your garden waterfall. See the earlier section,
“Lighting Your Garden,” for more information.
Using waste system pumps
Some homes may have a built-up or engineered drain field to which waste-
water must be pumped. These pumps are also sometimes called lift stations.
Such drain fields are usually mandated by the County Health Department if
the grade-level soil doesn’t percolate (or pass liquid through a porous sub-
stance) sufficiently. Improper percolation is normally due to a high water
level in the area. When the County Health Department does its perk test, it’s
assessing the soil’s ability to drain.
Wastewater pumps are sometimes equipped with alarms to alert you to a
problem. The alarm is a good feature, and required by building codes in most
states. When shopping for a waste pump, look for one that has an alarm or
can have an alarm easily added. These pumps are usually about 1/2 horse-
power and operate at 120 volts. Supply them with a 20-amp circuit fed by
12-3 UF Romex. The alarm circuit usually requires two more conductors to
connect to a failure-alarm float switch.

t seems that way too much time is spent indoors these days, and one
reason may be because computers, TVs, and video games are inside. But
you can use many types of electronic devices outside. Technology has come
a long way since the first battery-operated picnic-table TVs, and you can
have your electronic cake and eat it, too.
In this chapter we discuss some of the devices you can use outside, special
product choice considerations, and outdoor wiring. We cover some practical
considerations and ideas for bringing some elements of the digital age to
your patio.
Designing around the Weather
When installing wiring for electronic devices outside the home, make sure
that the wiring is safe, provides reliable connections, and is attractive (or at
least inconspicuous). Two basic strategies exist for bringing power and com-
munications wiring to the great outdoors:
 Overhead: Overhead wiring is usually less than ideal, not only because
it’s unsightly but also because you must maintain at least 10' of clear-
ance underneath. However, overhead runs may be okay if they run
under eaves or along porch or deck rails.

 Underground: For most outside installations, underground is usu-
ally the best choice. Underground cables are out of sight and out
of mind.
When running overhead or underground wiring, make sure the cable is
approved for the specific installation. All outdoor cabling should be water-
proof. If it will be run overhead, it should be rated for sunlight exposure; if
run underground, it should be rated for direct burial.
Running wires in bulkheads
One way to protect your wiring from the weather is to use a protective bar-
rier such as a wall or roof. Such barriers are often called bulkheads.
Chapter 16 explains that one of the easiest ways to protect wiring to an out-
side area is to use exterior house walls that share the area where you’ll use
power or communications. Your home’s exterior walls are good bulkheads
for protecting wiring. Look for other potential bulkheads such as half walls
built along decks and patios. Use these bulkhead wall cavities for wiring or
mounting boxes for outlets or electronics. Follow the same Chapter 3 rules
for roughing in when wiring in bulkheads. Also be mindful that you can use
conduit for exterior wiring.
Wiring directly to the point of use
You can run outdoor wiring directly to a point of use even if there isn’t a wall
or other bulkhead around.
All outdoor wiring should be rated as weatherproof. We recommend running
exposed wiring in a PVC conduit.
All outdoor receptacles must meet the following requirements:
 Outlets must be standard GFI outlets.
 Receptacle boxes and covers must be weatherproof.
 Use weatherproof in-use covers for receptacles in continuous use. In-use
covers are hooded, allowing you to plug in a cord with the cover closed.
Figure 17-1 shows an in-use outlet cover. The manufacturer claims it
280
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

works on 14 different receptacles types. The transparent hooded cover
has holes on the bottom to allow cords to exit with the cover closed. To
the right of the cover is a single-gang weatherproof box to which an in-
use cover is usually fastened.
 Use exposure-rated connectors for outdoor Ethernet and USB connec-
tions. Use jacks and plugs rated for dust and water exposure.
Connectors rated as IP67 are dust proof and rated for immersion in 1
meter of water. IP68 connectors are dust proof and can withstand
immersion for extended periods and being under pressure.
Many of the devices and cords you want to use outside may not be rated for
outdoor use. Take these things indoors after you use them, or at least cover
and unplug them.
Another way to protect outdoor outlets is to mount them so they face
the ground, deck surface, or patio and are protected by an overhang or
roof. But even in this case, down-facing outdoor receptacles must be GFI
protected.

Chapter 17: Outdoor Electronics

Using Electronic Devices
in Outdoor Kitchens
If you do a lot of cooking and entertaining outside, you may want an elabo-
rate outdoor kitchen area where you can use just about any electric kitchen
device. Wiring for an outdoor cooking area can run the gauntlet from power-
ing your grill for an electric charcoal igniter, to a multipurpose kitchen,
dining, and entertainment area. For the more upscale outdoor kitchen
and dining, calculate the power needs just as you would for indoor cooking
areas.
You might want to use some of these goodies in your outdoor kitchen:
 Electric grill: While most outdoor chefs cook with charcoal and gas, you
may want to consider an electric grill. If you’re a charcoal purest, you’ll
be happy to know that combination electric/charcoal grills are available.
Most electric grills draw a lot of current (as much as 20 to 30 amps or
more, depending on the surface size), so make this an important consid-
eration when planning your wiring.
 Refrigerator or warming trays: If you intend to include these items in
your outdoor kitchen, include their current draw in your load calculation
to determine feeder sizes and circuit breaker ratings. Use GFI-protected
breakers for all outdoor kitchen circuits.
 Lighting: The possibilities are nearly endless and may include over- and
under-cabinet lights, dimmers, and overhead (or string) lights. All of the
lighting fixtures should be weatherproof or rated for use in damp areas.
All of the wiring must be rated for the use you employ, which can include
direct burial, waterproof, or sunlight resistant.
 Convenience receptacles: Some items may serve double duty, working
in both your outdoor and indoor kitchens — toasters or your favorite
electric carving knife. Provide some outlets (GFI protected, of course)
for these devices.
As with all electrical systems, add up the anticipated loads and install a
feeder line to accommodate the loads. For just a few electrical appliances,
you may run several feeds from the house. For heavier, more elaborate
installations (including electric grills and large lighting loads), run a
feeder to a weatherproof panel and run all outdoor kitchen loads from
this panel.

Wiring Outdoor Theaters
or Sound Systems
We think stereo sound is a must outdoors. And if you’re fortunate enough to
live in a warmer climate, a full outdoor home theater — complete with 5.1 or
7.1 channel surround sound — isn’t out of the question. The faux rock speak-
ers available at many electronics retailers are a good choice for outdoor
sound. You can put them in the garden, next to decks, or along walkways.
The best sound sources are at or near ear level, so rock speakers work best
in areas such as sloped rock gardens. Other low-mount locations provide sub-
optimal sound quality, but you may decide that suboptimal stereo is better
than none at all.
Exposed speakers must tolerate water or be protected from rain, snow, sleet,
and hail by a weatherproof enclosure. Fortunately, many manufacturers
supply outdoor-rated speakers such as the Niles Audio OS5.3 or OS5.5. As
you compare brands and models, remember to include the following things,
and see Chapter 9 for more information:
 Frequency response of the speakers in your comparison
 Anti-corrosion materials
 Other durability features, such as mounting brackets that tolerate strong
wind loads or finishes that are resistant to sunlight.
If you don’t get outdoor-rated speakers, you can still protect them in other
ways, such as recessing them or mounting them under roofs.
Speaker wire used outdoors should be rated for outdoor use. Wires not rated
for direct burial will short out, possibly causing damage to your amplifier
when constantly exposed to wet or damp conditions. As always, use boxes,
wire, and cable rated for its intended use.
Controlling outdoor theaters 
or sound systems
Creating an outdoor theater or sound system doesn’t mean you have to buy
another whole set of equipment. Leverage the indoor electronic devices you
283
Chapter 17: Outdoor Electronics

already own by incorporating them into a multi-source, multi-zone sound
system that extends to your patio or deck. Chapter 9 describes multi-zone
systems in greater detail.
To control your multi-zone entertainment system from your outdoor theater
or sound system, install the control and faceplate supplied by the multi-zone
system’s manufacturer in a two-gang box in your outdoor area, and run Cat 6
cable between the box and the central control unit. Once connected, you can
play CDs, radio, or another audio source and control the selection and
volume from the remote control panel. To protect the panel in an exposed
area, install a hinged see-though plastic cover that you can lift when you
want to press the buttons. Alternatively, install the panel in a recess in an
exterior wall which is then covered by a small 12" × 12" cabinet door. Use
spar (marine) varnish to protect the door.
Planning the theater space
Bringing audio to an outdoor space is relatively easy because of the wide
availability of weatherproof speakers. Outdoor video is a little trickier, espe-
cially if you don’t want to place an expensive, weather-sensitive TV outside.
In one notable installation we have seen, the homeowner built a patio next to
the family room. A very large flat-screen TV was installed in the family room,
and then the homeowner installed a large picture window in the shared wall
between the family room and the patio. The picture window allowed people

Installing a Home Weather Station
Home weather stations and temperature monitors are popular additions to
the digital home. Weather reports on TV and radio are great, but they usually
can’t tell you what’s happening right now outside your house.
284
Part V: Extending Technology to Outdoor Living Spaces 

When you’re selecting a home weather station, look for a system with these
features:
 Solar power: Solar-powered weather stations eliminate the need to
run power wires to your roof or another hard-to-reach location. See
Chapter 15 for more information about solar power.
 Wireless data transmission: Along with solar power, wireless data
transmission eliminates the need to run a lot of wires. Information flows
wirelessly from the weather station to a monitoring panel inside your
home.
 Internet Protocol (IP) server: An IP server allows you to connect the
outputs from the weather monitoring station to your home’s Ethernet
network. Once connected and configured, the server module lets you
monitor the weather readings using a Web browser on any networked
computer in your house. If you have a static IP address for your home
(as described in Chapter 12), you may even be able to use the Internet
to monitor the weather conditions at your home from anywhere in the
world.
WeatherHawk makes home weather stations that have most of the features
in the preceding list. They also sell an IP server module that connects to
the outputs from the weather station, and the server module supplies
information to your computer’s Web browser over your home’s Ethernet
network.
Once you connect a home weather station to your home network, computer
software can monitor the weather station input, and use it to automate
actions within the home. For example, the software can turn on the air condi-
tioner when the outside temperature exceeds 76°F. See Chapter 13 for more
on home automation software.
The typical computer hookups include the sound card’s sound output and
microphone input, Ethernet network communications, and USB ports. .
Connecting computer electronics beyond this may require other standard
and even non-standard interfaces. The standard interfaces include RS-232, 
RS-422, and RS-485. Often the connections for these devices can be over
common twisted-pair wire such as Cat 6, and in other instances you have to
use shielded cables with very precise connections from and to certain pin
numbers on the devices’ connections. Closely follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for connections, pin outs, and cable types when wiring to install
any specialized equipment with non-standard wiring requirements.

Just for fun: Wiring a traffic signal 
in your driveway
Working with wiring, electrical devices, and
controls can be very, well, practical most of the
time. But armed with some knowledge and
practical know-how gained from reading this
book, you can undertake some projects that are
more for amusement and personal satisfaction
than for functionality. One such attention-grab-
bing project: a traffic-control signal light that a
Marquette, Michigan homeowner installed. (Flip
to the full-color insert pages in this book and
check out Color Plate 12 to see a photograph of
the traffic signal.)
Understanding how the signal works
Junkyards and recycling centers offer many
antique traffic signals. If the controls weren’t
salvaged (or salvageable), use three interval
timers to control the light. Turn to the full-color
insert pages in this book and take a look at Color
Plate 13 to see a diagram of the three interval
timers. Interval timers cost less than $100 each.
In the diagram shown in Color Plate 13, all of the
neutrals are shown as dashed lines. Ignore the
neutrals; they just provide the return path. The
time-delay relays, the signal lights, and the pilot
lights all need a connection to the neutral.
When troubleshooting, make sure that a neutral
wire is present and connected everywhere one
is needed.
Pilot lights on the panel cover are for timing
adjustment, because the stop-signal lamps are
normally out in the driveway, out of control
panel range. The relays are 11-pin plug-in time-
delay relays with an instant contact. You can
adjust the delay time from 0 to 60 seconds. The
instant contacts are on the right of each relay in
the diagram, and the timed relay contact is on
the left. NO denotes a contact that’s normally
open, and NC denotes a contact that’s normally
closed when no power is applied to the relay.
Think of the relays as a pair of three-way
switches. (See Chapter 4 for more about three-
way switches.)
In the figure shown in Color Plate 13, all con-
tacts are shown in the NC position, where no
power is applied. Connected means a wire is
connected from one pin to another pin to make
the necessary circuits. Contact or Contacted
means a relay’s contacts are closing to make a
connection from one pin to another inside the
relay.
Wiring in the logic
Wiring is the secret to a properly functioning
traffic signal light. The logical relay connections
determine the operating sequence of the three
lights. Trace the power wire in the figure shown
in Color Plate 13 to see how the system works:
1. The power source is connected to pin 1 of
relay #3, which is the common pin. Pin 1
contacts pin 4, which is the NC time-delay
contact on relay #3.
2. The power wire leaves relay #3 at pin 4 and
connects to pins 11 and 2 on relay #1.
3. When pin 2 is energized, the instant NO con-
tact operates and contacts pin 11 to pin 9.
4. Pin 9 powers pin 1, which contacts pin 4
until the relay times out.
The green signal light illuminates and stays
on until relay #1 times out.

287
Chapter 17: Outdoor Electronics
5. When relay #1 times out, the NC contact
opens and contacts pin 1 to pin 3.
6. Pin 3 connects to pins 2 and 11 on relay #2.
7. When pin 2 is energized, the NO contact
closes and contacts pin 11 to pin 9.
8. Pin 9 powers pin 1, which is contacted to
pin 4 and turns on the yellow light.
The yellow light stays on until relay #2
times out.
9. When relay #2 times out, pin 1 contacts pin
3, which powers pins 2 and 11 of relay #3.
10. The NO contact on relay #3 closes, con-
tacting pin 11 to pin 9 and illuminating the
red light.
The red light stays on until relay #3 times out.
11. When relay #3 times out, the incoming power
to relay #1 is opened and thus turned off.
This turns off all the relays, including relay
#3 and the red light. As soon as relay #3
loses power, the NC contacts pin 1 to pin 4,
restarting the sequence.
Building the control enclosure
The controls for your traffic light should be in a
secure, protected area such as a garage or
wiring closet. You can see a photograph of the
control enclosure for the traffic light in Color
Plate 14; see the full-color insert pages in this
book.
As you can see in the figure, the homeowner
added a time clock to control the operating
times, so the signal light is only on between 7:00
a.m. and midnight. The diagram shown in Color
Plate 13 only has three relays. This four-relay
wiring is nearly identical to the three-relay
layout we described, except that when the red
light relay times out, it operates the fourth relay,
which opens the power to the system.
Remember: Even though a traffic light is just a
fun project, you must select the devices and
install wire in accordance with the National
Electrical Code. See Chapters 2, 3, and 16 to
figure out the details for wire size, use ratings,
circuit breaker sizing, grounding, and wiring
methods.

Chapter 19
The Ten Biggest Wiring Mistakes
In This Chapter
 Not heeding the laws of physics
 Not paying attention to detail
 Misinterpreting or not following codes
 Not following workmanlike rules
W
iring your home properly makes it safer and more livable. Unfortunately,
home wiring is often sabotaged by a few common mistakes. Sometimes
these mistakes are the result of ignorance or laziness. Other times, they’re just
plain old blunders.
This chapter introduces you to ten of the most common mistakes people
make when home wiring. We present them so that you know how to best
avoid making these mistakes. So sit back and absorb this list of ten things
you don’t want to do.
Not Leaving Enough Slack
One thing that clearly separates a professional, workmanlike wiring job from
an amateurish one is the amount of wire slack left in junction and device
boxes. Overall neatness is hampered when you try to make quality connec-
tions using wires that are too short. And if repair work needs to be performed
later, the short wires add time and hassle to the job.
The problem of not having enough slack on the conductors in a box is often a
result of not installing a large-enough box in the first place. One popular man-
ufacturer offers a 32" × 32" two-gang box, which we feel is too small. (See

Chapter 3 for information on calculating box fill.) A larger-capacity box gives
you room to be neat and leaves enough room for wire slack. The largest nail-
on plastic boxes we found had the following capacities:
 Single-gang box with 22" × 22"
 Two-gang box with 41" × 41"
 Three-gang box with 57" × 57"
 Four-gang box with 68" × 68"
Try to leave at least 8" of slack on each wire if possible. Having generous
slack and choosing a box of sufficient volume allows you to neatly lay all of
the bare ground wires in the back of the box first, followed by layering the
neutral conductors. This leaves enough space to neatly fold the power wires
under the installed devices.
Not Paying Attention to Details
Wiring a home for lighting, appliances, computer networks, and other elec-
tronic equipment is a huge job. A momentary lapse in attention while doing
this work can cause damage to your equipment or even create a hazard for
the home’s residents.
Follow these basic rules as you work:
 Avoid doing electrical work while you’re tired, fatigued, or under the
influence of certain beverages.
 Always follow safety procedures, and exercise care with every connec-
tion you make to ensure that you’re doing the installation correctly.
 Pay attention to color codes on wire connections or cables.
 Read equipment installation instructions, heed the warning labels, and
read the information on allowable environmental factors to ensure they
match your installation and use conditions.
 Work closely with other trades. If you’re doing the work yourself, coordi-
nate your activity and installation of electrical, communication, and
plumbing to avoid the potential for conflicts. For example, if a plumber
runs a vent pipe straight up from the center of a vanity, this may conflict
with a lighting box you were planning to install.
296
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Including Lighting Loads
on Receptacle Circuits
Article 210 of the National Electrical Code (NEC) discusses branch circuits.
This code section requires the receptacle circuits in the kitchen, dining room,
laundry, and bath to exclusively serve only the power receptacles in those
respective rooms, and not be connected to the lighting or power receptacles
in other locations. We recommend that you keep receptacle and lighting
circuits separate throughout the entire house, not just in the rooms and
areas mentioned in the NEC. Only make exceptions in light-use cases such
as bedroom closet lights or outside lights where the only available wiring is
a receptacle circuit.
Lighting in a home is usually fairly reliable because of the stable loads on the
circuit. It is really annoying for occupants to have the lights go out when a fault
or overload causes a GFIC or breaker trips off line. Such lights-out scenarios
are prevented when the lights are wired on their own circuit breakers, sepa-
rated from the varying loads caused by the items that may be plugged into the
room outlets.
Ignoring Physics
Ignore the physics of your installation work at your own peril. The first clue
that you or your installer might be doing something to challenge the physics
of an installation is when you say or hear the phase “. . . that should be good
enough.” When you hear or say this, it’s time to extend your “Uh oh, here
comes trouble” antennae. Carefully consider the risk you’re about to accept.
Then don’t accept the risk: Have it done right or take the time to do it right
yourself. Following are some laws of physics you will contend with as you
wire your home.
Gravity
As an installer, you must concern yourself with securely attaching wires and
components, and this means finding suitable mounting locations. If you live
in an area that gets lots of snow, anticipate and avoid areas where ice may
form and fall onto your service entrance. In areas with harsh winter weather,
297
Chapter 19: The Ten Biggest Wiring Mistakes

power companies prefer that you install meter sockets on the gable end of
the building. Sometimes the gable end is the most visible, and the power
company’s preference may need to come second. Following our recommen-
dation for a well-placed through-the-roof mast avoids this problem and works
well on any style of pitched roof.
Attach all components securely and use large-enough screws for the job. If
you attach a meter socket to a single stud using one pair of vertical holes,
the holes on the other side will be about 6" away from any support. In most
modern construction, the wall itself is not very sturdy. Often, it is only vinyl
siding over insulation. The easiest way to secure the other side of the meter
socket is to install backers inside the wall. The backer should be a 2" × 6"
piece of lumber cut to fit between the studs, and then placed against the out-
side wall and nailed in place. If the wall has 1" insulation, use 1⁄4" × 3" lag bolts
to mount the meter socket through the siding and installation into the 2" × 6"
backer.
Use pre-placed backers behind drywall to secure surface-mounted fluores-
cent lights. For a drywall-finished mechanical room with a lot of equipment
to mount, it may prove easier to just sheet the entire wall space with 1⁄2" or
3⁄4" plywood before the drywall is hung. This takes a lot less time than measur-
ing out and installing a large number of backers. And if the layout changes
between design and installation, the full wall sheeting provides more mount-
ing flexibility.
Wind
The risk of swaying tree branches hitting or falling on overhead service wires
in a heavily wooded area may be avoided if you run the cable into the site
from another direction with fewer trees. Look at all your options and deal
with potential problems before making the wiring runs. When installing any-
thing outside, be wary of wind exposure and fasten every wire and compo-
nent in a suitable fashion. Be especially wary of chaffing, which can occur if
the wind causes a wire to vibrate or move against any object.
Water
Falling water, rising water, and condensation are all issues to consider when
you select locations to mount or use electrical devices, or the wires that
bring power or communications signals to them. Water in any electrical appa-
ratus degrades it by causing corrosion and rust. Excess water can also cause
shorts that trip GFI circuits and breakers. Avoid installing electrical items in
wet areas, if possible. If you can’t avoid doing so, use weatherproof wiring,
methods, and materials.
298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Fire
Excessive heat from things like chimneys, stoves, furnaces, and heaters can
cause problems for wiring and connected devices. Avoid making general runs
near high-heat sources. When making direct connections to heat-generating
appliances or fixtures, always use wire appropriately rated for such service.
Avoid running network, sound, and communications wires through ventila-
tion ducts in your home. If using ventilation ducts for network cabling is
unavoidable, make sure that you use Category 6 Ethernet communication
plenum-rated (CMP-rated) cable with 100-percent fluorinated ethylene propy-
lene sheathing. The plenum-rated cable is required if you’re running through
ventilation ducts.
Installations Not Designed
for Use and Abuse
Someone could kick or step on anything that protrudes from the wall, includ-
ing junction boxes you’ve mounted too low. Installations of conduits within
easy reach may become an inappropriate point on which people lean, swing,
or hang. These problems can hurt the people in your home, and shorten the
service life of your expensive installations. You can tell people, “Don’t lean on
that,” until you’re blue in the face, but unless you have eyes in the back of
your head, this probably isn’t a good plan for reducing damage.
Consider typical use and abuse when you choose locations and mounts.
Securely mount high-abuse items (such as video cameras), or mount them in
locations less likely to receive abuse (such as from the ceiling).
Improperly Interpreting the 
National Electrical Code
Article 230.9 of the NEC states that open service conductors shall be at least
3' away from any window. The operative word here is open, which means not
in a raceway or a wire cable assembly with a protective outer jacket. When
conductors leave a conduit or service entrance cable to connect to an over-
head drop with exposed conductors, they are considered open. This applies
whether the window has the ability to open or not.
299
Chapter 19: The Ten Biggest Wiring Mistakes

A manufactured-home factory in our area won’t place a service within 3' of a
window, even if it is a mast-type through-the-roof service entrance, which
clearly isn’t the meaning of this requirement. The company even includes
basement windows (if the manufactured home is placed on a basement) in
this misinterpretation.
The open-conduit requirement mentioned here is just one example of a code-
reading mistake you can make by not paying attention to the code’s heading
or not reading all of the exceptions. For example, requirements for voltages
over 600 volts are different from the requirements if the voltage is less. It’s
not okay to read a section of code requirements for high voltages and then
try to apply those rules to lower voltages.
Always be sure your understanding of the code is accurate and seek profes-
sional assistance and guidance if you don’t fully understand the code. Pay
particular attention if your compliance with the code rests on one or more
allowable exceptions. We recommend that you buy an electrical code book
or — better yet — the handbook of the code book. The handbook includes
every article the code book contains, but it also explains and clarifies many
of the articles and includes many illustrations.
When Grounding Is Not Grounding
Electrical grounding is supposed to do two things:
 Trip the circuit’s breaker if the hot wire accidentally touches any metal
surface that should be grounded.
 Provide some degree of lighting protection.
The ground conductor connected to a ground rod, although grounded, doesn’t
clear an electrical fault. The ground has to be solidly connected to the neutral
conductor at the electrical panel to clear a ground fault (also known as 
tripping the breaker). When lightning strikes your electrical service, the 
service grounding carries the lightning to the earth. When this happens, the
ground’s potential (voltage) at the grounding point spikes, and every ground
connected to the service ground spikes also. A lightning strike can be hun-
dreds of millions of volts and generate currents of 100,000 amps or more for
about 1⁄10 of 1 second.
Grounding is the most misunderstood topic in the electrical industry. In a
continuing education course Paul recently took as a licensing requirement,
the topic of auxiliary grounding was covered. Some designers require ground
rods on steel light poles. The presenter indicated how foolish he thought this
300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

was. His point of discussion was that the required grounding conductor that
ran with the circuit conductors also grounds the steel pole. The grounding
conductor is useful, and it is necessary to trip the breaker when a power-to-
ground fault occurs. A frayed wire or failed ballast could cause a fault and
energize the pole, causing a shock hazard if no ground wire traces back to the
service grounding point.
A driven ground rod by itself won’t necessarily carry enough current to trip
a breaker when a fault occurs, because ground’s soil (earth) is such a poor
conductor. If the ground conductor leading back to the panel becomes
opened, the ground rod lessens, but doesn’t eliminate the potential between
the pole and ground by raising the potential of the earth in the vicinity of
the ground rod.
On the other hand, the pole is a lightning rod waving to passing electrical
storms shouting, “Strike here!” If lightning strikes a light pole without an aux-
iliary ground rod, the voltage between the steel pole and ground can be tens
of thousands of volts. A person walking or standing near the pole could be in
serious danger. Add an auxiliary ground rod to increase the ground potential
and it reduces the hazard. A person actually touching the pole is still in some
danger, but those in proximity are much safer. In this case the ground rod —
although not required by code — is useful and adds some degree of safety.
This anecdote just reinforces our contention that grounding is often misun-
derstood, even by those teaching it. The advice we offer? Supplementary
ground rods add some safety. During a thunderstorm, don’t use power tools
or wired telephones; using indoor cordless phones is okay. Recent evidence
shows that using cell phones outdoors may also attract lightning. What you
heard as a child (“Stay away from metal and plumbing during lightning
storms”) is still very good advice.
If you have any light poles, lighted flag poles, TV/ham radio antenna towers,
wind generators, metal weather vanes, digital weather stations, or the
like at risk for lightning, please read and heed the information on proper
grounding.
Ignoring the BOCA or IRC Codes
Although amusing reading at times, code books aren’t intended for your
entertainment, nor are they merely suggestions. And the NEC mentioned ear-
lier in this chapter isn’t the only code you must heed. Other important code
books include the BOCA (Building Officials and Code Administrators) and IRC
(International Residential Code). Both building codes have specifications
301
Chapter 19: The Ten Biggest Wiring Mistakes

intended to prevent the various mechanical and electrical trades from weak-
ening the basic building structure through improper drilling or cutting, or
from modifications that reduce fire ratings and impair safety.
Take the time to review the section in Chapter 3 on drilling framing and joists.
It sometimes takes a little ingenuity and measuring to avoid drilling through a
bottom plate into the top of a joist for wires that have to be run down into a
basement or crawl space.
On pre-manufactured trusses, it is vital to avoid drilling through or near the
flanges, although 2X lumber is a little more forgiving if drilled properly.
Sometimes the wire can be run along the wall around a corner, and then
brought down. If you can’t avoid drilling down into multiple joists of 2X
lumber, drill at a 70@dg angle to come out high on the side of the joist. Drill
as small a hole as comfortably fits the wire.
Not Following Your Own
Consistency Rules
Throughout the text we have set up a number of suggested rules to follow
when planning and wiring your house. These rules have been developed over
many years of experience, and a few of them were adopted from advice from
friends in the trade. These rules have served us well, saving time and provid-
ing our customers a good, consistent job. Set your methods and performance
standards and follow them. Set consistent quality standards for your work
and take pride in it. Modify your rules only after careful and thorough consid-
eration of the “what-if” consequences of the changes you make.
Wiring systems are all about details, rules, and following correct instructions.
Take your time, do the job right, and savor your success.
Minimizing Wiring Runs
and Circuit Counts
All too often homeowners and builders will treat the electrical and communi-
cations wiring as the budget item to reduce. Going down that path will seri-
ously limit the options for fully automating and enjoying your home.
302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Running wires in new construction projects will never be cheaper than when
the walls are open. Also keep in mind that the wire itself is one of the least
expensive components of the project. Don’t get caught up in the trap of
reducing cost during the wiring phase by making fewer wire runs than you
anticipate using. Your home is more versatile and useful if the wiring you
need is put in place during the original construction. This applies to a lesser
extent in remodeling projects, but it still applies. The cost and difficulty of
wiring later after all the drywall is in and the paint is dry will be greater.
In some cases you can compensate for not having the wires by using wireless
technologies. Using wireless has tradeoffs with security, configuration, and
costs.
Plan your implementation well and think in terms of your home serving your
needs over the coming decades. Anticipate the potential for your changing
needs and wire for them now.

Ten Troubleshooting Tips
In This Chapter
 Develop a universally applicable troubleshooting method
 Lock-out and tag-out circuits
 Follow safety procedures
 Eliminate the trouble
T
roubleshooting is said to be part art, part science, and part luck. You have
to come up with the luck component entirely on your own; we can’t pro-
vide that. Perhaps a four-leaf clover embroidered over your shirt pocket will
help? But we can help you with the science — and maybe some of the art — of
troubleshooting. Essentially, troubleshooting is a repeatable process that you can
apply to any problem. You methodically eliminate possibilities until you’re left
with only the solution. The artistic elements of troubleshooting will come, but
usually only with the insight gained from experience.
Even though the spotlight of this book is on wiring, networking, and deploy-
ing digital equipment in your home, this chapter’s ten troubleshooting con-
cepts could help you solve almost any type of problem. It doesn’t matter if
the problem is with a lawn mower, car, sound system, or computer — a sea-
soned troubleshooter should follow certain steps. The tips presented here
are generic enough to apply to most problems, although in this case we’ve
tailored somewhat to residential electrical systems.
Collect the History
When something breaks, your first step is to determine the chain of events
that led up to the failure. If you were there when the problem occurred, you
have a head start. But if you weren’t there, you may have to become a detec-
tive (like Columbo or Sherlock Holmes). In these cases you can borrow some
key interrogatives from the press corps:
 Who
 What

 Where
 How
 When
 Why
Some of the questions may get immediate answers from people who were
there. Sometimes no one can provide history. You may come upon the prob-
lem yourself, or you may be called in by someone who has no idea what hap-
pened. You may find clues, but what appears to be a clue may not be useful
information at all. The following sections go over each of the questions you
should ask as you start troubleshooting.
Who witnessed the point of failure?
Knowing who was there when the breakdown occurred allows you to quiz
those witnesses: What was happening right up to the point of failure? For
example, knowing that a high-wattage heater was plugged in and turned on
just as the room lights went out might help explain why the breaker for that
room tripped offline.
If more than one person was present, keep in mind that any two peoples’ per-
ceptions and attention to details varies. Quiz everyone so you can collect as
much of the story as possible.
What was happening at the time?
Strong winds can find weak connections on overhead power lines, so knowing
there were 90 mph wind gusts when the room lights were flashing on and off
may help explain what happened.
The circumstances leading up to a failure often help you focus your energies
on the most likely cause. If you’re driving down the expressway and your car
starts to miss and jerk before the engine quits altogether, that event could
point to an empty fuel tank, a clogged fuel filter, or a loose ignition wire that
finally fell off.
Whatever the problem may be, knowing all the circumstances leading up to
the failure is helpful. All the collected information may not be relevant to the
failure. Once you’ve collected the circumstantial evidence, begin the analysis.
Investigate each item on your list for relevance. For each item on the list, ask
yourself if it could have been the definite cause of the malfunction.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Where was the device when it failed?
This question may not always apply, particularly in the case of fixed equip-
ment. But for portable devices, the location could be important. For example,
suppose you used a power drill inside the house to drive screws on a new
bookcase, and then you went outside to mount a flagpole hanger. The drill
failed when you tried to install the flagpole hanger. What could be the cause?
Why did it work in the house and not outside?
The problem may not be the drill’s failure. Suppose the power cord wasn’t
long enough to reach the work area, so you connected two cords and ran
them across a flowerbed. The two cords joined together at the flowerbed,
and while you were drilling the sprinkler system came on. The doused cord
might have caused a GFI circuit to trip.
Environmental factors can cause problems with sensitive electrical equipment.
Always consider environmental factors in your troubleshooting process.
How did it fail?
Pushing devices can lead to damage and failure. Knowing how the failure
appeared may help explain which component stopped working. If you overload
a drill motor, excessive heat and smoke may pour from the vents. If you spin
the starter on a stalled car for too long, the starter motor may overheat and
throw solder from its windings. So when the witness tells you the starter motor
quit after trying to start the motor for over ten minutes, and that there was a
pungent smell right before the starter motor quit working, that’s good data.
When did the failure occur?
Knowing the exact time of a breakdown can provide clues. Can the failure be
linked to some other event, like an electrical storm or high winds? Was another
major appliance running on a timer?
Why did it fail?
Troubleshooting’s ultimate goal is to understand why the equipment, con-
trols, or wiring failed. By understanding why the failure occurred, you can
avoid it or eliminate the possibility of future failure.
307
Chapter 20: Ten Troubleshooting Tips

Understand the Process
To troubleshoot any system or equipment, you must first understand what
makes the item work in the first place. In other words: How does it operate
normally? How does it work when it’s working correctly?
Take, for example, a gasoline engine. If you’ve never encountered engine trou-
ble in a car, lawn mower, or chain saw, it’s probably only a matter of time
before you do. A gasoline engine must have the following things to run:
 Fuel
 Spark
 Air
 Compression
Suppose your backup gasoline-powered generator fails. If you want to trou-
bleshoot, you must know how that generator works. That means knowing
the four necessary items, and then working through each to find out why
the motor will not start and run. Learn how your home works and arm your-
self with manuals, diagrams, and notes you made during construction and
installation.
Plan the Approach
Haphazard, random, and subjective aren’t good terms when you’re trou-
bleshooting wiring or electrical components.
 Make a list. The system and your knowledge of it help you plan your
approach by making a checklist of diagnostic tasks. If you aren’t familiar
with the system or equipment, do some research. A checklist made by
an expert can save you time and gives you steps with which to start.
 Check out the manual. Real troubleshooters aren’t afraid to read the
directions.
 Group tasks. Use logic, of course, and convenience. If you’re in the
neighborhood of X, you might as well check Y because it’s within easy
reach.
 Be inclusive. This is the most important part. All the related wiring,
controls, devices, and systems that feed into or from the failed device
must be on your checklist.
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Follow Safety Procedures
Whenever you troubleshoot, first stop and think about the safety risks. Haste
in troubleshooting can quickly harm you and those working with you. Finding
and fixing the problem is never worth risking injury to people or the destruc-
tion of expensive equipment. Safety should always come first.
Every trade or profession has a list of safety procedures. Electricians know
that energized wires bite, burn, and even kill. Federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) electrical safety standards apply equally to
novices and professionals alike. About 24 states have adopted their own elec-
trical safety standards as well. Whenever working with potential hazards,
take the time to learn and heed all the safety procedures required for your
safety and those working with you.
Some of the most common and important safety precautions to take when
working around electricity include
 Always follow lock-out/tag-out procedures when working on any of the
circuits in your home. When you work on a circuit, lock the circuit out
and place a tag on it stating that you’re the only one authorized to reen-
ergize the circuit. If other people on the job site are also working on the
same circuit, they must lock it out and tag it also. When their work is
completed, they remove their tags. The last person to complete work
and remove the last remaining tag can safely reenergize the circuit.
 Always use appropriate protective equipment, including eyewear, air fil-
tration masks when needed, and clothing appropriate to the tasks.
 Always take your time. A good troubleshooter realizes that staying safe
and living to troubleshoot another day are more important than getting
things done quickly.
Eliminate the Obvious
You’re at the neighbor’s barbeque and the center cut is on the rotisserie. For
some reason, halfway through cooking the motor stops on the rotisserie.
What could be the problem? Should you start taking the motor apart, or
should you first follow the cord around the corner of the house to see if the
kids accidentally knocked the cord out of the wall? While you’re at it, look
inside the house to see if the lights are still on, and peer across the street to
see if the neighbor’s lights are on, too. These clues help you identify a power
outage or tripped breaker.
309
Chapter 20: Ten Troubleshooting Tips

Whatever device or system you’re checking, take some time to review all the
potential causes of the failure, no matter how obvious and unlikely they may
seem. Otherwise, you’re going to look pretty silly for tearing apart the rotis-
serie motor, when the problem was that the cord was unplugged.
Begin at the Beginning
Troubleshooting electrical or digital devices can often begin at either end of
the circuit. A number of factors help determine the starting point, not the
least of which is your comfort zone for working on the failed device. To find
a problem, you must be methodical and begin at one end of the process and
proceed through, checking each stage, one by one, until you find the point of
failure.
When the lights don’t light, where do you start troubleshooting? If only one
light is out, it’s probably a bulb. If other electrical items don’t work, maybe a
single circuit is out. If all lights are out, look for the presence of lighting in the
neighborhood to see if there’s a larger power outage. Start at the beginning,
where you may find the most obvious causes and the easiest item to replace.
Avoid the Replacement Trap
An old adage says, “The best way to fix your broken car is to lift up the radia-
tor cap and then drive another car underneath it.” Needless to say, we don’t
seriously recommend this approach.
As you troubleshoot a problem, it’s very easy to replace widget A and see
what happens. Widget A becomes thingamabob B, and before you know it
you’ve replaced doodad Z and it still doesn’t work. You’ve just wasted a lot of
time and money and you still have trouble to shoot. Sure, you’ve eliminated
components A to Z as causes, but this isn’t the most efficient way to go about
fixing things.
When troubleshooting devices with multiple components, don’t haphazardly
replace components just because you think they might be the problem. The
original problem may actually end up destroying the new parts. Use testing
and logic to determine the problem, and only replace suspect parts when you
have fairly solid evidence that the component in question is, in fact, the real
cause of the trouble.
310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Check the Vital Signs
When you visit the doctor’s office, the nurse usually starts by checking your
weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing. The nurse checks
your vital signs to make sure they’re normal. Checking vital signs is an impor-
tant step in troubleshooting any wiring system or electronic device as well.
You need to know things like voltage, current draw, and operating tempera-
ture ranges before you can test them. For example, house wiring is supposed
to be 120 volts. If you check a circuit and the voltage is only 10 volts, you
have a vital clue as to the source of the problem.
Most digital devices in your home should have instruction manuals that
include troubleshooting procedures and normal vital signs. Store these manu-
als in a safe place, and refer to them when you have problems.
Eliminate the Cause
Replacing a blown fuse or restarting a circuit breaker doesn’t eliminate the
cause of the problem; it only treats a symptom. As the troubleshooter, you
must solve the problem, not just treat the symptom. The goal of trouble-
shooting is to find the underlying cause, make the repairs, and take steps
to prevent a recurrence.
Once you’ve isolated what needs repair or replacement, take care when
making the repair. Always follow safety precautions by turning off power and
shutting down equipment before making any repairs. Disconnecting wires on
live circuits is dangerous, and it can cause damage to the equipment because
of voltage spikes. Always use the Off switch or breaker to power down the
equipment or circuit you’re working on.
Verify the Repair
Verification is your final step and provides quality control for the trouble-
shooting process. Being certain your efforts have actually found and fixed the
problem is the mark of a serious troubleshooter. A pro wants to be certain that
it’s really good to go when she says, “It’s good to go.” Use every feature after a
repair. If, for example, you just replaced a bad switch on a four-way circuit,
test every other location on that circuit.

Appendix B
What Mr. Ohm Wanted 
You to Know
P
robably more than once you heard a math teacher say, “Someday you’ll
need these math skills in real life!” Now pay attention, because your
math teacher was right. Basic mathematics ensures you’re using the right
type of wire and other components.
This appendix tells you a little bit about the formulas, terms, and calculations
involved with home wiring. We can’t turn you into a professional electrician
with this one appendix, but we can give you enough information to impress
your friends and wire your own home.
Using the Basic Ohm’s Law Formula
The basic formula for Ohm’s Law is stated as follows:
I = V/R
 I is current.
 V is voltage.
 R is resistance.
Some people use E for electromotive force in place of V, but either is okay.
With simple algebra you can derive that V = I × R and R = V/I. This defined
relationship between current, voltage, and resistance allows you to predict
mathematically the electrical circuit’s behavior. When 1 volt is connected to 
a circuit that has a resistance of 1 ohm, the current flowing is 1 amp.
The diagram in Figure B-1 is a basic DC-series electrical circuit. If you change
any one of the values, one or both of the remaining values change to keep the
relationship equal.

The following sections describe calculations used in DC-powered circuits. For
AC power (which most home power circuits use), the voltage and current
aren’t always in phase with each other. Calculations for AC circuits must
include the power factor, which we describe in the section “Measuring power
in AC circuits” later in the appendix. See Chapter 2 for an explanation of the
difference between AC and DC power.
Measuring current in amps
An ammeter is just like a piece of wire. High current flows through the meter.
The ammeter adds a miniscule amount (essentially zero) of resistance to the
circuit. The ammeter functions by reading the tiny voltage drop across the
meter’s own very low internal resistance. At full scale, this voltage drop may
be .050 volts (50 millivolts).

Part VII: Appendixes 

Measuring electromotive force in volts
Unlike the ammeter, the voltmeter is essentially an open circuit. It adds a high
resistance load to the battery. The resistance in this example may be as high
as 240,000 ohms, or 20,000 ohms per volt (240,000 ohms ÷ 12 volts = 20,000).
In Figure B-1, the battery supplies 12 volts, and a 2-ohm load (resistance) is
connected across the battery. This causes 6 amps of current to flow as mea-
sured on the ammeter.
Calculating Electrical Values
Not all electrical values in a wiring circuit need to be measured, and in some
cases you can’t take measurements directly. Instead, you can use published
or known values and calculations. The following sections show you how to
calculate various electrical values.
All the electrical calculations described in this appendix can be arranged in 
a pie chart. (See the Ohm’s Law chart on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this
book.) This chart provides an easy way to find the various electrical mea-
surement formulas without having to remember or go through all the alge-
braic manipulations.
321
Appendix B: What Mr. Ohm Wanted You to Know
Who was Mr. Ohm?
Georg Ohm was a German physicist born March
16, 1787. He observed and recorded the rela-
tionship between current, voltage, resistance,
and temperature in electrical conductors. He
found that the current through a wire is propor-
tional to the square of the wire’s diameter, and
inversely proportional to the wire’s length at a
given temperature.
In spite of the fact that today we refer to elec-
trical resistance as ohms, Georg Ohm spent
most of his life in poverty. Ohm published his
findings in 1827, but at first his theory made him
an object of ridicule. His very significant contri-
bution to science was dismissed throughout
most of his own lifetime, although by 1840 the
scientific community began to understand its
significance. He was eventually honored by
being granted a professorship in experimental
physics at the University of Munich. He died five
years later at the age of 65. The symbol for ohms
is the Greek capital letter omega: Ω.

Calculating power in watts
Instantaneous electrical power is expressed in watts, and is the product of
current times voltage.
Power = I × V
In the sample circuit shown in Figure B-1, the voltage is 12 volts and the cur-
rent is 6 amps. That gives a power rating of 72 watts.
Ohm’s Law states that E = I × R (or V = I × R). Substitute I × R for V in the P = 
I × V formula, and you have P = I × I × R or P = I2 × R. Using the readings from
the example in Figure B-1, the current is 6 amps and the resistance is 2 Ω.
Doing the math, the result is 6 × 6 × 2 = 72 watts of power for this circuit.
Calculating energy use in watt-hours
Often, power use includes a time element. The power used in your home is
measured in watt-hours, or more accurately KWH (kilowatt-hours). If you used
72 watts of power for 1 hour, that equals 72 watt-hours. If you use that same
amount for a whole day, that equals 1.728 KWH (72 × 24 ÷ 1,000 = 1.728).
Measuring power in AC circuits
When determining power values in AC circuits, you must include the power
factor in your calculations. The power factor, a number between 0 and 1, is
the cosine of the angle at which the current leads or lags the voltage. This
angle represents the relative time differential between when voltage and the
current change polarity, or direction, in the circuit. AC circuits feeding regular
incandescent light bulbs and heating equipment are resistive loads, and don’t
contribute to power factor. However, circuits feeding electric motors and
light fixtures with ballasts (such as fluorescent and HID lights) have a lagging
power factor.
Sometimes you need to include power factor to calculate power require-
ments when voltage and current are out of phase. For example, it takes twice
as much amperage to do the same work when the power factor is at 0.5
instead of 1.0. This phase differential is caused by an inductor and can be
corrected with a capacitor or a synchronous motor.
The best way to explain power factor is to graph it by tracking it through one
full cycle of current flow. Figure B-2 begins to graph the power line (marked
with a P), when both the voltage line (marked with a V) and the current line
(marked with an I) are positive.
322
Part VII: Appendixes 

The Ohm’s Law chart (on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book) reveals
that the power used is voltage times current. That formula works fine until the
voltage becomes negative. Now you have a positive current times a negative
voltage, giving you a negative power. This is impossible, because there’s no
such thing as negative power. This power is called reactive power. This condi-
tion exists until (for 45°) the current also goes negative. Now you have a nega-
tive voltage times a negative current, yielding a positive power. The negative
values of the current curve at the beginning of the graph are omitted for clar-
ity. The reactive power present at the beginning of the graph is omitted
because you are only tracking one current cycle. The reactive power is
graphed below the 0 line with cross-hatching and is marked RP. You can easily
see that if the voltage and current were in phase (lined up with each other),
the power curve would be much larger and there would be no reactive power.
The power factor in this chart is .707, which is the cosine of 45 degrees. If the
current in this example were 141 amps at a power factor of 1 (referred to as
unity), the current would only have to be 100 amps to produce the same
power.

Appendix B: What Mr. Ohm Wanted You to Know

Turn to the full-color insert pages in this book and check out Color Plate 16 to
see a photograph of a power factor meter taking a measurement; the power
factor meter reading in the photo is about .94. The Power Factor Meter (PFM)
needs a current and voltage input to produce a reading. A load is on the cord to
the left. The PFM compares the relationship (phase angle) between the load’s
current with the circuit voltage. We’re using an adapter plugged into the cord
from the GFI. The adapter does two things: It gives you a place to connect the
PFM’s voltage leads, and it separates the conductors within the adapter to the
load. One side of the line runs around the loop that the PFM jaw clamps to. If
you just clamp the PFM jaw around the cord, it measures the current in both
directions and the in-flowing and out-flowing currents cancel each other out.
Using the NFPA Wire Properties Table
The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has sponsored the National
Electrical Code (NEC) since 1911. The original code document was developed
in 1897 as a result of united efforts by various insurance, electrical, architec-
tural, and allied building and construction interests.
One of the most handy parts of the NEC is Wire Table Number 8, which is
used primarily for calculating the voltage drop on a wire run over any given
distance. This table is included here as Figure B-3. Various parts of this book
refer to wire properties that are consistent with this table. The most fre-
quently used column in the table is the Area (Circular Mils) column. This
number is used with one of two formulas to calculate the voltage drop for
electrical power circuits over various wire sizes. The number isn’t really the
cross-sectional area of the wire, but rather the product of the square of the
diameter of the wire expressed in mils. (A mil is a unit of measure equaling
1⁄1,000 of 1", and is most often used to express the thickness of wire, sheet metal,
and plastic films.)
In an electrical circuit, ideally you keep the total voltage drop to less than 5
percent. The electrical service to your house is assumed to have a voltage
drop of up to 2 percent from the transformer to your service panel. This
assumes other loads are on the electrical service besides the circuit you’re
concerned with. This means that your branch circuits should keep voltage
drop to 3 percent or less.
The formula for determining voltage drop in single-phase circuits follows:
VD = 2L × K × I ÷ CM
To calculate voltage drop, use the following terms and values:
 VD is voltage drop expressed in V (volts).
 L is one-way length of the wire run expressed in feet.
324
Part VII: Appendixes 

 CM is the circular mils from Wire Table Number 8.
 I is the maximum current expressed in amps.
 K is a constant multiplier for the wire type you’re using:
• For copper conductors at 75°C, K = 12.9
• For aluminum conductors, K = 21.3
This table is used by permission from the NFPA.
Table 8. Conductor Properties
Notes:
1. These resistance values are valid only for the parameters as given.  Using conductors having coated strands,
different stranding type, and especially, other temperatures changes the resistance.
2. Formula for temperature change: R2 = R1 [1 + a(T2 - 75)] where: a cu = 0.00323, a AL = 0.00330
3. Conductors with compact and compressed stranding have 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively, smaller bare
conductor diameters than those shown.  See Table 5A for actual compact cable dimensions.
4. The IACs conductivities used: bare copper = 100%, aluminum = 61%
5. Class B stranding is listed as well as solid for some sizes.  Its overall diameter and area is that of its
circumscribing circle.
FPN: The construction information is per NEMA WC8-1992.  The resistance is calculated per National Bureau
of Standards Handbook 100, dated 1966, and Handbook 109, dated 1972.

Appendix B: What Mr. Ohm Wanted You to Know

In some chapters in this book, we use 10.2 as the copper wire constant. This
is the constant for copper at 60°C rather than 75°C. We believe 10.2 is more
realistic in most instances.
Most houses are supplied from single-phase 120/240-volt circuits. Single
phase is supplied from a single alternating source of power or from one phase
of a three-phase source. Some circuits, such as those supplying multiple-
horsepower motors, are usually three-phase circuits; they require a different
formula for determining voltage drop. Three-phase power sources or line
transformers are configured in wye (Y) or delta (∆) configurations. In a three-
phase circuit, the voltage and current cycle from each individual phase are
separated by 120°. The formula for three-phase circuits follows:
VD = 1.73L × K × I ÷ CM
Notice that in three-phase circuits, the 2L (two times length) changes to
1.73L. The 2L in single phase is just the one-way length doubled to account
for the circuit’s total length. On a three-phase circuit, the return path for each
phase wire is through both of the remaining three-phase conductors. The
return conductors operate 120° out-of-phase with each other. This accounts
for the 1.73L as opposed to 2L.
If the sample circuit carries 15 amps at 120 volts over 45' of 14 AWG copper
wire, the calculation looks like this:
(45 × 2 × 10.2 × 15) ÷ 4110 = 3.57 volts
The voltage drop is 3.57 volts, but you can round up to 3.6 volts. Since this is
a 120-volt circuit, divide 3.6 by 120 and you get .03, or 3 percent:
3.6 ÷ 120 = .03 = 3%
Add this to the assumed 2-percent voltage drop for the service, and this cir-
cuit is within the allowable 5-percent total voltage drop.
.03 + .02 = .05 = 5 %
One of the main reasons for calculating voltage drop is to determine the
needed wire size in circular mils to keep the voltage drop to 3 percent or less.
To solve the equation for circular mills, VD and CM just change places, result-
ing in this new formula:
2L × K × I ÷ VD = CM
326
Part VII: Appendixes 

If your maximum allowable voltage drop is 3.6 volts, and you’re running 50' of
copper conductors for a 20-amp maximum load circuit, the calculation looks
like this:
(2 × 50 × 10.2 × 20) ÷ 3.6 = 5,666 circular mils
As you look at Wire Table Number 8 from the NEC (shown in Figure B-3) notice
that no wire has exactly 5,666 circular mils, but the next larger size wire is 12
AWG with 6,530 circular mils. However, even though the calculation works out
to 12 AWG wire, remember the 80-percent maximum loading rule: The circuit’s
maximum constant load mustn’t exceed 80 percent of the wire’s capacity.
Therefore, you should use the next larger wire size, which is 10 AWG.
Selecting Conductors
This NFPA NEC table indicates the allowable current-carrying capacity for a
conductor at various insulation temperature ratings. When many current-
carrying wires fill a conduit or run together, the current and induction cause
the conductors to heat up. Overheating eventually destroys the insulation,
causing electrical shorts, which will cause breakers to trip.
When you purchase wire or cable, the specifications should list the following
things:
 Wire size
 Use-type rating
 Insulation’s maximum temperature rating
Table 310-16 (included here as Figure B-4) from the NEC indicates the maxi-
mum amperage a conductor can handle without overheating and exceeding
the insulation’s maximum temperature rating. The table also lists the maxi-
mum over-current protection (circuit breaker or fuse) that may be used on a
feeder run. Use this table as a starting point for choosing conductors. The
ratings in NEC Table 310-16 are for three or fewer conductors in a raceway or
cable. The following sections provide additional guidance for conductors in
various situations.
Regardless of your conductor size, you mustn’t exceed amperage and tem-
perature ratings for the circuit breakers. Most circuit breakers are rated 
at 75°C.

Limitations for using small conductors
Smaller conductors handle less amperage than larger conductors do, so spe-
cial rules apply when using small conductors. These rules define the maximum
breaker or fuse size to use with given conductor sizes. The special rule says
that unless specifically permitted in other sections of the electrical code, the
over-current protection (circuit breaker or fuse) mustn’t exceed the following:
 AWG 14 copper wire: 15 amperes
 AWG 12 copper wire: 20 amperes
 AWG 10 copper wire: 30 amperes
 AWG 12 aluminum and copper-clad aluminum wire: 15 amperes
 AWG 10 aluminum and copper-clad aluminum wire: 25 amperes
Don’t forget to adjust the size of a circuit’s over-current protection using 
correction factors such as ambient temperature and the number of applied
conductors. For information on correction factors, see the NEC tables in
Figures B-3 and B-4.
Bundling conductors together
If you have more than three current-carrying conductors in a cable, conduit,
or raceway, you have to adjust, or derate, the conductors’ ampacity ratings
by the percentages in Tables B-3 and B-4. You must derate them if they meet
any of the following criteria:
 You’re running separate cables through the same drilled hole.
 You’re running separate cables through the same conduit.
 You’re running separate cables together for 24" or more.
The NEC provides separate tables for installations that involve constant
loads and load diversity. Load diversity means that not everything is turned
on at the same time. Many circuits in your home are considered to have load
diversity, so use the adjustments listed in Table B-1. In situations where the
conductors carry a constant load, use Table B-2 instead.

Most modern conductors have a 90°C insulation temperature rating. To
derate conductors, follow these steps:
1. Determine how many conductors are run together.
Suppose, for example, that you have 20 conductors sharing a couple of
holes, so they run together for more than 24".
330
Part VII: Appendixes 

2. Refer to Table B-1 to determine the derate percentage.
According to Table B-1, if these conductors have load diversity, you
should derate the conductors by 70 percent. Copper 14 AWG wire with 
a 90°C rating can normally carry 25 amps.
3. Multiply by the percentage
In this example, multiply by 70 percent (0.7) to get 17.5 amps.
4. Round down to the small conductor limitation.
In this example, the largest breaker you can use on this circuit is 15
amps. Even though the calculation works out to 17.5 amps, in this case
the small conductor limitation applies, so the maximum breaker size is
limited to 15 amps.
Using non-metallic cable (NMC)
The maximum ampacities of non-metallic cable (NMC), or Romex, mustn’t
exceed the 60°C ratings. You can use higher temperature ratings for derating
calculations, but the final ampacity rating of the wire size and circuit break-
ers for Romex runs can’t exceed the 60°C ratings.
Converting between Celsius 
and Fahrenheit
Conductors and breakers are usually rated in Celsius, but if you live in the
United States you’re probably more comfortable with the Fahrenheit system.
You may not always have your math crutch (a calculator) at your side, but
you can still perform quick Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions using a stubby
pencil and paper. Simply use the magic number 40:
1. Add 40 to the known temperature.
This applies whether you’re converting from Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit
(F) or vice versa.
2. Multiply that number as follows:
• To convert from F to C, multiply by 5⁄9 (0.5555).
• To convert from C to F, multiply by 9⁄5 (1.8).
3. Subtract 40.
331
Appendix B: What Mr. Ohm Wanted You to Know

To quickly find the Celsius temperature for 120°Fahrenheit, the math looks
like this:
120 + 40 = 160 ×
5⁄9 = 88.8 - 40 = 48.8
To convert 100°Celsius to Fahrenheit, the formula looks like this:
100 + 40 = 140 ×
9⁄5 = 252 - 40 = 212
Ethernet Length Limits
Throughout this book, we recommend that you use four-pair, copper, Cat 6
cable not only for Ethernet computer networks, but for a variety of other
uses. We recommend Cat 6 because it’s easy to work with, is readily available,
can handle high frequencies, and is easy to terminate (with the right tool).
Cat 6 cable can be terminated into a RJ-45 plug connector, or into a punch-
down block on an outlet jack.
Cat 6 is versatile, but it isn’t without limitations. Chief among its limitations is
run length when used for transmitting Ethernet data packets. If you have to
run a Cat 6 network cable for more than 100 meters (328') — say, to your
artist studio on the back 40 — you may need to use special kinds of Ethernet
cable. The Base T standards for Ethernet cabling assume a limit of two seg-
ments, or 200 meters. The 10 Base 2 thin Ethernet standard allows three seg-
ments for a total distance of 555 meters using repeaters. Thin Ethernet cable
is similar to TV cable, and with the right crimping tool a do-it-yourselfer can
easily install it. Table B-3 lists Ethernet cabling standards and the limitations
associated with each.
Use plenum-rated cable if the cable runs though air ducts.

a. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop. (You can also
find My Computer on the Start menu.)
b. Double-click the drive letter for the CD ROM drive containing the
HALbasic CD.
c. Find the icon labeled Install Menu and double-click it.
3. When the Install Menu appears, select the Install HALbasic option.
This will bring up the HAL Installation Wizard and step you through the
various screens.
4. Follow the installation wizard’s prompts.
After you finish the installation wizard, the HAL Setup Wizard automati-
cally begins. 
5. Complete the HAL Setup Wizard by answering the various questions.
When the setup wizard is completed, the HALbasic program begins,
prompting you to register the software.
Registration is required to activate the one-year software license. You
must provide a valid e-mail address because the registration number is
e-mailed to that address.
After you complete the registration process, HALbasic launches, and you
can begin to enjoy the benefits of the HAL home automation software!

What You’ll Find
HALbasic, from Home Automated Living, Inc.
14401 Sweitzer Lane, Suite 600
Laurel, MD 20707
www.automatedliving.com
The HALbasic program is an entry-level version of the home automation soft-
ware introduced in Chapter 13. The version included on the CD is a fully func-
tional, one-year user license that must be registered prior to use. HALbasic
enables you to use some of the neat things discussed in the book, such as
time- and voice-based control of lights and devices within your home that are
equipped with X10 or X10-compatible controllers though any one of multiple
supported X10 interfaces. (To use additional controllers or features, consider
upgrading to HALdeluxe or HAL2000.)
HALbasic also allows you to use voice commands to control many aspects of
your Internet experience. Getting the latest stock quote, checking the weather
forecast for your destination city, or checking prime time TV listings by voice
commands are all possible with the HAL software.
HALbasic offers other features such as voice mailboxes, directory informa-
tion, notification services, and more.
If You’ve Got Problems (Of the CD Kind)
HALbasic will work on most computers that meet or exceed the minimum
system requirements. Regrettably, your computer may differ, and some pro-
grams may not work properly for some hard to discover reason.
The most likely problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM) for
the programs you want to use, or you have other programs running that are
affecting installation or running of a program. If you have problems, you
might try one or more of the following suggestions, and then try using the
software again:
 Turn off any antivirus software that you have on your computer.
Installers sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer
incorrectly believe that it is being infected by a virus.
 Close all running programs. The more programs you’re running, the less
memory is available to other programs. Installers also typically update
files and programs. So if you keep other programs running, installation
may not work properly.
337
Appendix C: About the CD

 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This
is, admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, if you
have a Windows 98 or later PC, adding more memory can really help the
speed of your computer and allow more programs to run at the same
time. 
HAL’s Web site lists a number of support services and frequently asked 
questions at www.homeautomatedliving.com/support.shtml. For addi-
tional support, registered HAL users can telephone Home Automated Living’s
Technical Support department at 301-498-7000. The Technical Support depart-
ment is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM Eastern time.

Color Plate 1: This photo shows a closet light switch
controlled by a pilot switch. The pilot light in the
switch illuminates so that you can tell that the closet
light is on, even if the door is closed. The closet is well
lit with a 32-watt, four-foot florescent strip fixture. See
Chapters 3 and 4 for many good tips on wiring for
lighting.
Color Plate 2: A variety of Decora devices, ranging
from combination devices where two switches are
installed in a single space, to dimmer switches that you
simply touch to operate. To find out how to add the
finishing touches to your wiring project like the pros,
see Chapter 4.
Color Plate 3: Using X10 controls made it easy to control
the lighting fixture and fan in this room without needing 
to rewire (and possibly damaging the expensive oak wall
panels in the process). Chapter 5 tells you more about
using X10 remote controls.

Color Plate 4: This is a color photo
of a three-way switch showing the
proper connections. It illustrates a
switch wired in accordance with
the diagram shown in Figure 4-5
(see Chapter 4). In this photo, you
can see the ground wires that
were omitted for simplicity's sake
from Figure 4-5. For more about
connecting three-way and four-
way switches, turn to Chapter 4.
Color Plate 5: The connection view of a surround sound processor, with numerous jacks for connecting the processor to
other devices and speakers. See Chapter 9 for more about surround sound and for diagrams that show the correct angular
layout for surround sound speakers.

Color Plate 6: This table shows the electrical symbols used
on digrams throughout this book. Use this table to interpret
the kitchen and whole house wiring diagrams shown in
Color Plates 7 and 8, respectively.
Color Plate 7: This is a closer view of the wiring in the
kitchen area (see Color Plate 8 for the wiring diagram
of the entire house). The kitchen is the busiest area for
electric circuits. This diagram includes some details
that had to be omitted on the whole house diagram,
such as the light over the sink and its switch. For more
information on accommodating the electrical needs in
the kitchen, refer to Chapter 3.

Color Plate 8: This wiring diagram of a 2,031 square foot house is frequently referenced in this book. Although some 
circuit numbers are present, rather than placing a circuit number next to each usage, we color-coded the various circuit
devices to make it easier to see how the wiring circuits should be run. In each instance, we indicate where the circuit from
the panel is run, and each one is marked as a home run with the circuit number. Notice that all the receptacle circuits are
separate from the lighting circuits.

Color Plate 9: This photo shows an inverter-battery power sys-
tem for a very remote camp. With solar power and a backup
generator supplying power for the inverter batteries, the own-
ers enjoy the convenience of round-the-clock power when
they visit their tranquil hideaway. To discover more about
backup power systems, see Chapter 15.
Color Plate 10: A Katolight backup power genera-
tor is shown in this photo. Katolight offers genera-
tors powered by engines made by a variety of
manufacturers. This generator is powered by a
GMC V-8 engine that is fueled with natural gas.
Installing a backup generator can keep your
home's circuits working during an extended power
outage. See Chapter 15 for more about backup
power.
Color Plate 11: This photo shows the transfer switch for the
Katolight generator presented in Color Plate 10. The conduc-
tors are phase identified by applying colored tape. The red
tape identifies phase A, the blue tape identifies phase B, the
plain black wire indicates phase C, and the white wires are
the neutral conductors. The backup generator phase wires
must be installed to match the power company's phase rota-
tion. This 400-amp capacity generator uses two conductors
for each phase (parallel conductors) to accommodate the
high-current loads.

Color Plate 12: The antique stop
light in this photo was installed for
the homeowner's amusement (and
maybe because it's something the
neighbors don't have). Visitors prob-
ably guess there is no valid reason to
stop when the light is red, but they
usually stop anyway. Chapter 17
provides the instructions to build
and install a stop light of your own.
Color Plate 13: This wiring dia-
gram illustrates the control that
operates the stop light. By tracing
the colored circuits from green to
yellow to red, you can follow the
operational sequence of the time
delay relays that make this control
work. See Chapter 17 for more
information on how this control
works.

Color Plate 14: The finished control panel
operates the antique stop signal shown in
Color Plate 12. If you wire a controller for a
traffic signal (covered in the “Just for fun:
Wiring a traffic signal in your driveway” 
sidebar in Chapter 17), it may look very 
similar to this one.
Color Plate 16: This photo is an
example of measuring the power
factor with a power factor meter.
The power factor meter needs to
sample the voltage cycle and cur-
rent cycle evident on a line at the
same time so it can compare them.
The meter reports the phase angle
difference (power factor) as a
cosine. When the voltage cycle and
current cycle are exactly in sync,the
power factor is 1. See Appendix B
for more information about under-
standing the power factor.
Color Plate 15: When a #12 AWG wire is loaded at 100 amps by the
high-current transformer in this soldering gun (even momentarily), it
heats up very quickly, as you can see. At 98.1 amps, the wire starts to
turn color from the heat after only a few seconds. Chapter 16 provides
more information about calculating current loads for branch circuits.
