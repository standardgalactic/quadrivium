Tuan 
Nguyen
WindoWs is, no doubt, a very large 
part of my life. It’s involved with me at a 
personal level and is part of my career. 
For work, I use Windows every day—
from benchmarking to testing out new 
hardware to playing games, everything is 
done on Windows. It goes without saying 
that Windows is deeply embedded into 
nearly every facet of my reality.
The relationship has been long—27 
years, in fact, since Windows 3.0. Both 
of us have evolved over time. Like any 
serious relationship, we’ve had our ups 
and our downs, but at the end of the day, 
it’s been there for me.
Windows does have its quirks, though. 
Sometimes, in the middle of a long 
conversation, it just ups and leaves. Sure, 
it returns after a minute or two, but I 
would appreciate some sort of heads-up. 
You know, like saying ,“Hey, I need a quick 
break, I’ll be right back.” But no, it just 
throws a fit, and when it does return, it’s 
to a clean slate—it’s forgotten everything 
we were talking about.
There have been years when our 
relationship was really on the rocks—the 
Vistas of our old place weren’t nearly as 
nice as they were supposed to be. But, 
thankfully, Windows has learned from 
some of its more grievous mistakes. For 
the most part, I’ve been content. More 
recently, it got a major makeover, coming 
to me with new ideas.
For one, it now tells me it’s more 
eager to play games, and even tries to 
stop doing other tasks to make sure it 
stays focused. It brought home some 
new colored outfits, and is even more 
aware of how important security is to me. 
At night, Windows is more thoughtful, 
too, dimming the lights to a warmer tone 
to help my eyes and let me sleep better.
But for all of its efforts, I have to admit, 
my eyes are starting to wander. I catch 
myself looking at others, admiring their 
sexy cat-print outfits. I’ve never been 
promiscuous, but there are things about 
Windows that have really grown stale.
In recent times, I’ve been going out 
more often, and Windows doesn’t like 
the outdoors. My phone follows me 
everywhere, and has introduced me to 
many more places around the city than 
Windows ever did—recently I’ve been 
mountain hiking a lot. When I look at my 
watch, it knows how I feel. It can tell if I’m 
staying healthy, and lets me know that 
I’m doing better at my goals.
To be honest, I’ve been seeing another 
on the side. It’s awful to admit, but I find 
this new relationship so much more 
fulfilling. I don’t want to reveal any 
identities, so let’s just refer to it as the 
cloud. What I can say is that most things 
Windows was good at, the cloud is better. 
It stays with me. I can go from one PC to 
another—even a Mac—and stay synched.
Thankfully, 
the 
game 
life 
with 
Windows is still great. It always shows 
me new ideas to keep things spicy. And 
now that I’ve got VR-gra, our gaming 
sessions last even longer.

relationship

Intel shifts release schedule to counter Ryzen
Intel’s X-Series 
Pushed Forward
as top dog. A 12-core Skylake-X 
isn’t far behind, either—August 
looks likely.
We 
were 
expecting 
something pretty solid from 
Intel; it’s not a company that 
takes its position lightly, and 
the renewed competition from 
AMD looks to have focused a 
few minds. The whole of Intel’s 
release schedule has been given 
a good shake-up. Coffee Lake 
is also expected to make an 
early appearance this summer, 
rather than early next year. 
This is still a 14nm chip based 
around the Kaby Lake core, 
but is about 15 percent more 
efficient and, more importantly, 
will have up to six cores. We’ll 
get a new 300-series platform, 
too. The X-series may grab 
headlines for a while, extreme 
editions always do, but Coffee 
Lake is as significant a launch. 
The jump after that is to the 
10nm Cannon Lake, a shrink 
and optimization of Kaby Lake, 
which is due next year. Intel 
has just invested $100 million in 
five new EUV machines, used in 
extreme ultraviolet lithography, 
to boost development. 
We were expecting the 
X-Series to arrive in August 
and be shown off at the 
Intel 
Developer’s 
Forum. 
Unfortunately, the IDF has been 
canned, which is a pity, because 
it was always a great event for 
talking directly to engineers, 
and has become something of 
an institution—it’s been held 
every year since 1997. Intel 
says it has extensive online 
documentation to answer any 
technical questions, but that’s 
not the same as buttonholing 
an engineer over coffee. At 
least the company won’t have to 
suffer any more embarrassing 
demonstration failures in front 
of an invited audience. 
Meanwhile, AMD has plenty 
more to bring us. It has a 16-core 
version of its Ryzen and the 
accompanying X399 platform 
in the pipeline for this fall, 
aimed squarely at the highest 
of the high end. Good news all 
around—there’s nothing like 
some real competition to move 
things along. –CL
The buzz around AMD’s Ryzen 
has been frantic, and the x86 
HEDT 
(High-End 
Desktop) 
world has become refreshingly 
competitive. 
Intel’s 
initial 
response was some fairly 
enthusiastic price cuts, but now 
the company has something 
more solid, because it has 
pushed forward the launch of its 
“Basin Falls” X-series platform 
to this year’s Computex show, 
all ready for sale in June, two 
months early.
The Basin Falls platform 
consists 
of 
the 
X299 
motherboard chipset, new R4 
LGA2066 socket, and X-Series 
processors. At launch, we will 
see four new chips: one Kaby 
Lake-X and three Skylake-X. 
The newer Kaby Lake chip has 
a better optimized architecture, 
but the Skylake has the grunt. 
Other goodies include up to 10 
USB 3.0 ports, plus eight SATA 
Gen3 ones.
The 
six-core 
Skylake-X 
will support 28 PCIe lanes, 
while the eight- and ten-core 
versions will get 44 lanes. All 
get support for four-channel 
memory. The first Kaby Lake-X 
has a more modest four cores, 
16 PCIe lanes, and dual-
channel memory. Both families 
are 14nm pieces, and will be 
branded as i7-7000 series. It’s 
that 10-core Sky Lake-X that 
will draw the most attention, as 
Intel fights for the bragging right 
Intel doesn’t 
take its position 
lightly, and the 
competition 
has focused a 
few minds.

windows is no longer the most 
popular OS used to access the 
Internet. According to StatCounter, Android accounts for 37.93 percent of 
devices, against 37.91 percent for Windows. It highlights the massive move from 
desktop to pocket. In 2012, Android had just 2.4 percent.
Where are Windows phones? At 1 percent. Microsoft still dominates the 
desktop, but never effectively managed the move into mobile devices. Apple’s 
iPhone showed the world how to do it, and Android did it for the mass market. 
Meanwhile, Windows on phones was viewed as an embarrassing dad trying to 
dance with the youngsters at a party. Not cool. It can’t buy its way out of trouble, 
either; it might have been possible in 2005, but Google bought Android instead, 
and now it’s open source. This is one tech bus that Microsoft has missed. –cl

self-driving 
cars are big. 
From Google to Uber, Tesla, and 
beyond, the tech is exploding. 
Apple has been toying with the 
idea for some time, under the 
name Project Titan. It went quiet 
for a while, and Apple claimed 
to be only interested in the in-
car technology and software. 
However, it has been busy hiring 
automotive 
experts, 
moving 
executives about, and has just 
been granted a permit to test 
self-drive cars in California. 
Whether or not we see a fully 
Apple-branded car is another 
matter, although the success 
of Tesla must make it tempting. 
Despite modest sales, Tesla’s 
share price makes it the world’s 
most valuable car company, 
bigger than Ford or General 
Motors. This wealth isn’t built 
on hard profits—the company 
doesn’t make any—but it shows 
confidence from the markets 
that it’s on the right track. Tesla 
has been dubbed the Apple 
of the car world—annoying if 
you’re actually Apple.
Apple has a record of taking 
a market and really shaking 
it up, from phones to music 
players, to simple laptops. 
Taking on the car market is a 
tall order, but Tesla shows that 
you can certainly take on the 
aspirational high end of it. Don’t 
hold your breath, though; it’ll be 
2020 at the earliest before we 
see anything you can drive, or 
be driven in. –cl

iT seems we do love a bit of retro gaming. 
Nintendo re-launched its NES console last 
year, and the shrunken Classic edition cost 
just $60 and shifted 1.5 million units, proving 
something of a cult hit. Demand was such 
that it had to arrange extra shipments, and 
a vibrant secondary market developed. 
However, Nintendo has stopped making it, 
along with the controller, too. According to 
a company statement, it “wasn’t intended to 
be an ongoing long-term product.” It seems 
its success took Nintendo by surprise; the 
console was only supposed to be a limited 
holiday season special.
The good news is it means manufacturing 
capacity has been released for this year’s 
slice of retro, a SNES, again a shrunken mini 
version. The SNES has a massive range of 
classic games, including examples from the 
Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, Street Fighter, 
and Super Mario franchises. Again, this will 
be a limited run machine, and Nintendo won’t 
want any left over—so, as they say, order 
early to avoid disappointment. Question is, 
will we get a mini N64 next year? –cl

Will the Real Titan Xp 
Please Step Forward?
Now we know why Nvidia didn’t use that name in the 
first place, because following the launch of the GTX 
1080 Ti, which boasts slightly higher performance 
than the Titan X (Pascal), we have the new Titan Xp. 
And unlike all the earlier cards, the Titan Xp comes 
with a fully armed and operational GP102 GPU.
As for specs, the Titan Xp isn’t just a full GP102 
processor with 3,840 CUDA cores. It has 12GB 
of GDDR5X memory, and the memory runs at an 
impressive 11.4Gb/s. The GPU clock is also higher 
than the Titan X, matching the 1080 Ti. Combined 
with the extra 1GB of memory and an extra 32 bits on 
the memory interface, the Titan Xp has 13 percent 
more total memory bandwidth and 7 percent more 
computational power than the 1080 Ti. It also retains 
the $1,200 price point of the Titan X (Pascal).
I suspected something like this would happen 
ever since the Titan X (Pascal) first launched, 
because it had two SM clusters disabled. This is in 
clear contrast to the Titan X (Maxwell), which has 
a fully enabled GM200 GPU, looking more like the 
Titan (Kepler), with its partially disabled GK110 core. 
Nvidia left room for the Xp by releasing the GTX 1080 
Ti with 11GB of memory and a 352-bit bus, still with a 
partially disabled GP102 chip. We end up, then, with 
a repeat of the 780, Titan, 780 Ti, Titan Black rollout 
of the Kepler days—without the added bonus of fast 
FP64 support on Titan.
The more interesting aspect of this pattern is that 
it points to the slowing down of Moore’s Law. It would 
When nvidia released the Pascal version of the Titan X 
last August, it created an overlap on the Titan X name. 
That caused confusion, so instead of calling the new card 
the Titan X (Pascal), the unofficial name became Titan XP. 
be awesome to see a completely 
new graphics architecture every 
year, but that’s not sustainable, 
and we don’t get new process 
nodes every other year either. The 
smart business approach is a slow 
rollout of new parts to keep things 
fresh, which is exactly what Nvidia 
has done with Pascal (and Maxwell 
and Kepler).
The GP100 was announced for 
Tesla P100 in April 2016 (and the 
Quadro GP100 as of February 2017); 
it probably won’t ever be a consumer 
chip, because of the cost of HBM2 
and the added FP64 support. While 
technically 
second, 
the 
GP104 
launched in May/June with the GTX 
1080/1070, and was the first widely 
available Pascal implementation. 
The modestly priced GP106 (GTX 
1060 6GB/3GB) then followed in 
July/August, which also happened 
to coincide with the GP102 showing 
up in the professional Quadro 
P6000. The GP107 (1050/1050 Ti) 
was released in October, rounding 
out the budget end of the 10-series 
parts, and now the GP102 is in the 
1080 Ti and Titan Xp.
In other words, Nvidia stretched 
what would have once been a top-to-
bottom launch into a rollout that has 
spanned the past year. That should 
carry us to the next-generation 
Volta architecture, which will still 
use a 16nm FinFET process. Count 
on another year for the full Volta 
rollout 
(Titan 
TV coming in 
spring 2019—
you 
read 
it 
here 
first!), 
and Nvidia should successfully fill 
the void as we wait for 10nm and 
7nm to come online.
There’s a second aspect to 
the Titan Xp and 1080 Ti worth 
mentioning, and that’s the pending 
arrival of AMD’s RX Vega. We should 
have that in our labs soon enough, 
but based on early information, I 
don’t expect Vega to be able to beat 
the 1080 Ti, let alone the Titan Xp. 
Nvidia is very good at staying on 
top, and 1080 Ti and Titan Xp are 
supposed to do just that. I’d love 
to see an upset, but AMD’s RX 500 
cards are slight tweaks to the 
existing 
Polaris 
offerings, 
and 
Vega will need to see AMD through 
the next year. It’s the graphics 
card equivalent to Intel’s tick-
tock model: high-end GPUs in the 
spring, midrange in the fall, and 
new architectures every two years.
The smart business approach 
is a slow rollout of new parts 
to keep things fresh.
It may look 
the same, but 
the Xp boasts 
improved specs 
and features.

If you liked the fact that the FCC was going to 
restrict an ISP’s ability to track your DNS requests 
and browsing habits so that an ISP couldn’t sell said 
data to the highest bidder, the US Senate majority 
gave users a big middle finger at the end of March. 
The implications for this are huge, mostly because 
just about everyone in the United States relies on 
an ISP, whether that’s the cable or DSL line to their 
house, or their mobile carrier. All of that personal 
usage data has been vacuumed up, and that’s set to 
continue for the foreseeable future.
There’s a big difference between an ISP scooping 
up data and a service such as Facebook or Twitter. 
Facebook et al. are opt-in; you sign up. You can still 
use the Internet without signing up for their service. 
An ISP is a gatekeeper to the Internet itself. Without 
going through an ISP, you can’t get online. Period. 
There are things users can do. I’ve often written 
about using a VPN whenever connecting to a dicey 
open Wi-Fi location. If the rules going forward do not 
allow users to opt out of data collection, using a VPN 
at home may be a necessity if you value your privacy. 
The problem with that is that VPNs often slow 
down traffic, due to the overhead of encryption and 
the need to funnel data through a single location 
where the VPN servers are located.
The other problem is that, unlike ISPs, VPNs are 
largely unregulated, and you have to shift trust from 
your ISP to a VPN service. If you’re looking for a VPN 
provider, look long and hard at the privacy statement 
to ensure that it doesn’t keep logs 
or share data with third parties. If 
you’re even more paranoid about 
having your metadata accessed, 
such as your billing information, 
find a VPN that accepts gift cards 
as payment.
And the last thing that will annoy 
you about having to use VPNs is that 
they are inconvenient. The minute 
you connect to your VPN, you’re cut 
off from your own LAN. I always 
forget to turn off my VPN connection 
on my phone when trying to turn 
off my Philips Hue bulbs, and it 
drives me nuts. The most seamless 
solution is to use a router that 
connects to a VPN with its Internet-
facing Ethernet port. Not all routers 
do this, and most routers that tout 
VPN features actually imply that

Finally, be sure to find a VPN 
provider that uses the OpenVPN 
protocol. OpenVPN is a modern 
open-source protocol that’s more 
secure than the older PPTP. Linux 
users can find OpenVPN client 
plug-ins for NetworkManager in 
most repos. Windows users can 
download a VPN client from http://
openvpn.net.
You can also choose to use Tor, 
though its performance hits often 
exceed those of a decent VPN. But 
again, for the paranoid, Tor will keep 
your browsing more anonymous.
NetworkManager makes choosing and connecting to a VPN a snap.

Choosing a panel type used to be simple. You chose TN if you were cheap or wanted to game, 
or IPS for almost everything else. Now, it’s not so easy. The best TN tech has improved 
dramatically, though the benefits have only touched a minority of monitors. Meanwhile, IPS 
panels have become far cheaper, and VA tech keeps throwing in that high-contrast curve 
ball, thus offering a flawed but compelling alternative. Meanwhile, the PC is now so capable 
that the range of uses and applications, not to mention screen sizes and resolutions, are 
so varied that the pros and cons of the three main panel techs are more nuanced than ever.
TN vs. IPS vs. VA
Video Playback
You could argue that any LCD technology 
is doggie do when it comes to video 
playback. Shining a light through a huge 
number of imperfect shutters is a pretty 
dumb idea compared to an OLED panel, 
say, where each pixel is its own light 
source. And yet LCD technology has 
developed to the point where it has very 
nearly—but not quite—shaken off its 
inherent shortcomings.
For watching video, that means a 
number of things. Colors and contrast 
are super-important for pure visual 
pizzazz, and VA, with its super-high 
contrast capability, scores heaviest 
and delivers the most superficially 
impressive results with video. IPS 
technology has closed much of the gap 
when it comes to contrast, but the specs 
do not entirely lie. VA panels with static 
contrast capability of 3,000:1 or more are 
now common. That is simply beyond the 
capabilities of IPS tech.
However, 
accuracy 
also 
counts, 
especially if you like a more natural 
vibe with your video and movies. In that 
scenario, IPS tech works best. Of course, 
pixel response is also important, given 
that video involves motion. But the 
downsides that TN brings to video in 
pretty much all other regards rule it out 
of the running in this category. 
Tie: 
IPS and VA
Gaming
If there’s a single application type you 
can rely on to hammer your PC into 
whimpering submission, it’s gaming. No 
surprise, therefore, to find it’s gaming 
that makes for quite the conundrum 
when it comes to choosing panel tech.
On the one hand, you want zingy 
colors, plus plenty of pop and contrast 
in your games, right? VA it is, then. Of 
course, color accuracy also counts, 
especially when it comes to picking 
out enemies in shadowy, low-contrast 
scenes. Better make it IPS. But hang on, 
you also want zippy pixel response, the 
highest possible refresh rates, and the 
absolute minimum of input lag. Can we 
change that to TN, after all?
Whatever you go for will be a 
compromise. For instance, the latest 
IPS monitors aimed at gamers have 
begun to adopt refresh rates of 120Hz 
and more. Likewise, panels of all types 
can be had with frame-synching and 
performance-smoothing Nvidia G-Sync 
and AMD FreeSync tech. But in the end, 
the most rewarding gaming screens 
are the ones that handle motion best. 
And that undeniably means TN. The 
good news is that TN has come on a lot 
in terms of colors and contrast of late. 
So, it’s not the bum steer it used to be by 
those broader metrics.
Winner: 
TN 
Content Creation 
Of all the categories here, content 
creation is probably the only one for 
which the preferred panel technology is 
a near 100 percent nailed-on certainty. 
It’s IPS you want. That’s because IPS 
is comfortably the most accurate LCD 
panel technology available.
The point is that IPS gives you the 
best chance of ensuring that whatever 
content you’re producing at your end 
looks right when it’s consumed at the 
other end. If you want to color correct 
for print, for instance, it’s the obvious 
choice. Admittedly, if some of your 
audience insists on using substandard 
viewing devices—perhaps a PC with a 
wonky TN panel—there’s only so much 
you can do. But the point remains: 
IPS is the way, the truth, and the light 
for accuracy.
If there are exceptions, the first 
would involve cost. Aside from accuracy, 
having a high native resolution is 
desirable in terms of being able to view 
large images and high-definition video 
within the bounds of an editing app. And 
that can be expensive with an IPS panel. 
At least, it used to be. The cheapest  
27-inch 4K IPS monitors are now roughly 
only 10 percent more expensive than 
a TN equivalent. IPS is pretty much a  
no-brainer, therefore.
Winner: 
IPS

Web and Office
For web and office work, it’s all about the 
pixels—or, more specifically, how many 
of them your screen has. It’s actually a 
more complex question than you may 
at first consider, given that you have 
to factor in both the actual resolution 
in horizontal and vertical pixels, and 
then the panel size. Together, that 
determines the pixel pitch.
The problem, in this particular 
context, is that the world of computing 
isn’t yet entirely, you might say, DPI 
agnostic. In other words, much of the 
web, and even some bits of the Windows 
GUI, are based on static bitmaps, which 
scale poorly if you bump the Windows 
DPI setting away from 100 percent. That 
can make for problems with very high 
DPI screens. Go for, say, a 24-inch 4K 
screen, and you’ll be forced to choose 
between wonky Windows elements 
and blurry bitmaps on the one hand, 
or stupid-small fonts and icons on 
the other.
The final reckoning for this category 
doesn’t map terribly well to panel type. 
However, if you can afford it, the accuracy 
of IPS, combined with high resolution 
at the right panel size, is the optimal 
choice. But both VA and TN technology 
can make for pleasant enough web 
and office partners.
Winner: 
IPS
General Desktop Use 
Want a horse? Then you’d better know the 
course. And so it is for choosing a panel 
for general desktop use. Much depends 
on your preferred mix of apps, your 
viewing environment, and your budget.
Not too long ago, cheapskates could 
find great value in something like a 4K 
TN panel. TN tech in that format offers 
surprisingly good colors and contrast, 
and the 4K res provides oodles of space 
for juggling app windows. More recently, 
however, IPS and VA prices have tumbled, 
and the price delta has dwindled to 
decidedly insignificant proportions. And 
so the choice narrows to IPS and VA.
For general use, though, IPS has 
the edge. That’s primarily down to 
superior viewing angles. It’s not that VA 
viewing angles are poor per se, but the 
consistency of IPS makes for a more 
pleasant general computing experience. 
It just feels right, while VA, on the other 
hand, is superficially punchier, yet 
ultimately less pleasing to the discerning 
eye. The exception might be using a panel 
in extreme ambient light conditions, 
be that exceptionally bright or dark. In 
both cases, you might then lean toward 
choosing VA. In bright conditions, the 
extra pop is welcome; while in a very 
dark environment, you’ll appreciate the 
reduced backlight bleed. 
 
Winner: 
IPS
And the
Winner Is… 
If there can be only one winner, then 
it has to be IPS. It’s not the best panel 
tech by each and every metric—VA 
panels offer superior contrast and 
superficial pop, while TN screens are 
faster—but IPS’s overall balance of 
qualities simply cannot be beaten.
Indeed, it’s actually when you put 
all the objective tests to one side and 
simply absorb the look of a screen that 
IPS scores most heavily. Monitors using 
other panel technologies often have a 
certain wow factor—for instance, the 
punchy colors or deep contrast of a 
big VA panel—but if you discover the 
Maximum PC crew huddling around 
the latest LCD marvel, and quietly 
muttering, “My God, that is lovely,” it’s 
almost always an IPS panel.
Of course, there are exceptions. If 
speed is critical, TN still rules. Likewise, 
at any given price point and form factor, 
there may be conspicuous bargains 
that push the value proposition toward 
either VA or TN. However, as pricing 
continues to converge, that’s less often 
the case. As Principal Rooney said, les 
jeux sont faits for other screen techs. 
Translation: Choose IPS.

Windows 10 Grows
Hi Doc, I’m a long-time 
reader, and I always look 
forward to your column. I have 
two questions. First, in the 
January issue, there was an 
article that covered creating 
Windows 10 recovery media. 
I followed the instructions 
and used the Windows media 
creation tool, intending to 
burn a DVD, but received a 
message that the image was 
too large for my disc. 
Then I tried using Windows’  
Recovery Drive creation tool 
(Windows 10 Pro 64-bit). I had 
a 16GB SanDisk Cruzer Glide 
in my USB port, and started 
the utility. After a couple of 
clicks, a message told me to 
“Please wait,” with a moving 
progress bar. But the bar 
stopped with an error that 
said, “We can’t create the 
recovery drive. A problem 
occurred while creating the 
recovery drive.” It didn’t give 
me any information about the 
problem or how to solve it. 
My only storage drive on this 
system is a 750GB Samsung 
840 EVO SSD. Any ideas?
My second question is 
this: I’m putting a parts list 
together for my next PC, 
based on the Kaby Lake 
architecture and Intel’s Z270 
PCH. It’s shaping up well for 
the most part, but I’m hoping 
you can clear up the current 
storage landscape. Between 
M.2, U.2, NVMe, SATA, and 
PCIe, my head is spinning 
(no pun intended). What 
would the best-performing 
drive interface be for this 
new system?  –Steve Vanetti
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: By 
Microsoft’s own admission, the 
company recently refreshed 
its Windows 10 media, which 
put the ISO file’s size over the 
capacity limit of a single-layer 
DVD. Now you’ll need a flash 
drive (8GB-plus) or a blank 
dual-layer DVD. 
When you fire up the media 
creation tool, choose the 
“Create installation media for 
another PC” option. Microsoft 
will likely suggest a language, 
edition, and architecture based 
on your hardware. If you’d like 
to change any of those, uncheck 
“Use the recommended options 
for this PC,” and click “Next.” 
The following screen lets you 
create a bootable USB flash 
drive or download the actual 
ISO. Although the Doc likes to 
keep ISOs on a storage server 
for safe-keeping, you may not 
share the same compulsion. 
In that case, leave the default 
selection, plug your drive in, 
and proceed. You’re warned 
that files on the drive will be 
deleted, and asked to choose 
a drive letter/device. Once 
you move to the next screen, 
Windows starts downloading. 
As far as storage is 
concerned, it may be easiest to 
explain with an example. Let’s 
start with MSI’s Z270 Gaming 
Pro Carbon motherboard, if 
only because the Doc has one 
sitting in front of him as he 
writes this. The board’s specs 
claim support for six SATA 
ports, two M.2 slots, and an 
optional Turbo U.2 Host Card. 
The SATA ports provide up to 
6Gb/s, or roughly 600MB/s, of 
peak throughput. Many modern 
SSDs hit that ceiling during 
sequential transfers, so they’re 
already a bottleneck. The M.2 
slots support SATA, too, but in a 
different form factor (M.2-
based SSDs look like sticks 
of gum lying down on your 
motherboard). Here’s where 
things get tricky, though: MSI’s 
M.2 slots also accommodate 
SSDs designed to communicate 
over PCI Express. Four lanes of 
third-gen PCIe give you 32Gb/s 
to work with. There’s always 
the option to plug a PCIe SSD 
into an expansion slot on your 
motherboard, or MSI sells a 
Turbo U.2 Host Card separately. 
The U.2 interface is similar to 
M.2 in that it enables up to four 
lanes of third-gen PCIe. But it 
takes the connection off your 
motherboard, enabling you to 
attach an ultra-fast SSD using 
a cable. 
If performance is top 
priority, PCI Express-based 
storage using the NVMe 
protocol rules. It maximizes 
bandwidth and minimizes 
latency compared to SATA and 
the old-school AHCI protocol. 
As such, the drive you’re 
looking for will drop into an M.2 
slot, occupy a PCIe add-in card, 
or plug into a U.2 port. The form 
factor you choose is largely a 
matter of personal preference.
Partition Manipulation
Doc, I thought I could 
do almost anything on a 
computer, but the more 
I research this, the less 
confident I am. I have Windows 
10 (build 1511) and want to 
upgrade to build 1607. When 
I try, I get a message that 
says, “We couldn’t update the 
system reserved partition.” Is 
there a reasonably safe way to 
expand that partition? I looked 
at Partition Magic and another  
M.2, PCIe, 
and U.2 are 
best for fast 
storage.

package I can’t remember the 
name of—neither appeared 
capable of doing the job. 
 
–Joel Vignere
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: It 
should be possible to extend 
your system reserved partition. 
First, back up all your important 
files to another device. There 
are no guarantees this process 
will work the same way on your 
machine as it did on one of the 
Doc’s test beds. Proceed with 
caution, understanding that 
fiddling with partitions can 
result in data loss.
If you’re willing to accept the 
risk, download an app called 
MiniTool Partition Wizard Free. 
The utility gives you a Windows 
Disk Management-like look at 
your storage subsystem, but 
with far more flexibility. One 
of its capabilities is labeled 
“Move/Resize Partition.” Use 
that to shrink your operating 
system partition a bit. Then, 
click the “Extend Partition” 
feature to make the system 
reserved partition larger. 
The Doc’s native Windows 
10 installations all have 500MB 
system reserved partitions, so 
that might good to aim for.
GPU Upgrade
Hi Doc, I'm planning a Socket 
AM4-based build using a 
Ryzen 7 1700X or Ryzen 5 
1600X. I own an Acer Predator 
XB271HU 144Hz G-Sync 
monitor and an EVGA GeForce 
GTX 1070 graphics card.
As much as I would love 
to buy a new GeForce GTX 
1080 Ti, it’s simply out of my 
price range. So, should I snag 
another 1070 and run in SLI, 
or upgrade to a 1080? I play 
first-person shooters such as 
Doom, Battlefield, and Call 
of Duty.   
–Daryl Austin
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: On its 
own, your GeForce GTX 1070 
is fast enough to play most 
games at 60fps or more, using 
the top quality settings at your 
monitor’s native 2560x1440 
resolution. However, you 
undoubtedly want even higher 
performance, given that 
display’s 144Hz refresh rate. 
SLI is a viable option. In 
DirectX 11-based games, 
adding a second GPU should 
yield impressive scaling. But 
be aware that the benefits of 
SLI are often less pronounced 
under DirectX 12. Further, 
there’s not much support 
for multi-GPU rendering in 
today’s VR games. Given the 
diminished attractiveness of 
these configurations, the Doc 
would recommend against a 
second 1070.
At $500, the least-expensive 
GeForce GTX 1080s are 
certainly more affordable than 
they were pre-1080 Ti. Still, 
$500 is a hefty sum for a fairly 
modest step up. Re-evaluate 
the performance you’re seeing 
after piecing together that 
Ryzen-based configuration and 
try to stay patient. After all, 
Vega will change the graphics 
landscape soon, either by 
wooing gamers or justifying a 
wave of new GeForce sales.
The Science of Cooling
Good morning, Doctor. 
Why don’t CPU cooler 
manufacturers rate their 
products based on the watts 
of heat they can dissipate? 
I have a 220W AMD 
processor that I cooled for 
several years using Cooler 
Master’s Hyper 212 EVO. I 
recently read that it needs 
liquid cooling. Due to the 
size of my case, though, I 
went with a 120mm radiator 
platform. After installing 
NZXT’s Kraken X31, the CPU 
seems to be running hotter 
than before. Now it crashes 
when I play Doom, where it 
was fine previously. Does the 
X31 have less capacity than 
the Hyper 212? I am running 
the X31 in performance mode, 
and installed another fan in a 
push/pull configuration. 
This system will go to my 
son once I upgrade to Ryzen. 
Currently it sports a Radeon 
R9 280. Is it worth buying the 
Radeon RX 480?  –Ray Brown
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Excellent question, Ray. 
The Doc took your inquiry to 
the knowledgeable folks at 
Corsair, where senior project 
manager Bobby Kinstle helped 
address it: “The heat capacity 
of a liquid cooler varies with 
a bunch of other factors, 
including what it’s attached 
to and how. The numbers I 
could come up with would 
sound big, but are ultimately 
meaningless. Case in point: 
the H100i set to full speed, with 
heat directly applied to the 
cooler as efficiently as possible, 
has a heat capacity of several 
thousand watts before the 
plastic melts. At such extreme 
power levels, however, other 
variables come into play. For 
instance, the thermal grease 
may exceed its absolute heat 
capacity first.
“Chip packaging is often the 
biggest thermal resistance to 
overcome. Heat is generated 
in a very thin layer on the 
silicon, but then has to conduct 
to a copper cap via thermal 
grease or solder. Next, the 
cap has to conduct the heat 
and hopefully spread it out a 
little (but not much, since it’s 
only 1mm thick). Heat has to 
pass through another layer of 
thermal grease atop the heat 
spreader, after which it can 
enter the cooler. Recent CPUs 
with thermal grease inside 
of them can hit their thermal 
conductivity limits at power 
levels as low as 200W. Intel’s 
Core i7-4790K is a famous 
example of this. Overclocked, 
it’s almost impossible to 
cool with systems running at 
ambient. That’s why you often 
see die temps in the 55–60 C 
range with only 95W loads. 
“Now, take the same 
cooler and put it on a 
250W Titan X. We’ll see die 
temperatures around 35 C. In 
this example, the die is much 
larger, reducing the heat flux 
per square millimeter. Also, 
the silicon is in direct contact 
with the water block through 
just one layer of thermal grease 
(a very poor conductor of heat 
compared to metals).”
So, yeah, there are a lot of 
factors that go into defining 
cooling performance other than 
heat capacity. In your specific 
case, the Hyper 212 EVO is 
undersized for something like 
an FX-9590, whereas an X31 
should be fine. If you’re seeing 
higher temperatures with the 
NZXT closed-loop liquid cooler, 
there may be a problem with 
the hardware itself or your 
installation (insufficient or 
uneven pressure on the CPU?). 
As for graphics, the 
Radeon RX 480 represents a 
respectable upgrade over the 
R9 280, particularly if your son 
plans to game at 2560x1440.

So, here we are: the dreaded annual 
motherboard 
supertest. 
A 
new 
architecture and a new platform, 
filled with uncertainties, early BIOS 
versions, and all sorts of bugs, 
errors, and crashes to contend 
with. An absolute swamp of auto-
asphyxiated hell for any hardware 
reviewer. Indeed, many across the 
industry have dreaded this day, 
because it means the suspension of 
sanity for at least two weeks.
Why do we put ourselves through 
this? We do it for you, our readers, 
and, of course, because we’re fired 
by the rampant curiosity that drives 
each and every human being. It’s 
rather like asking, “What is the 
meaning of life?” or “What did 1998’s 
McDonald’s Szechuan sauce actually 
taste like?” We simply have to know 
which motherboard is best, and—
more importantly—which board is 
right for you.
With Ryzen, AMD has positioned 
itself in a particularly odd place 
within the marketplace. By default, 
the processors themselves compete 
quite happily with the bulk of Intel’s 
Broadwell-E, 
high-end 
desktop 
platform on performance, at both 
single and multicore performance, 
decimating chips that cost almost 
$700 more than the lowest-end 
seven 
series 
chip. 
However, 
the chipset is more akin to that of 
a mainstream Z170 Skylake 
motherboard, 
harboring 
nowhere 
near 
the 
number 
of 
direct 
PCIe 3.0 lanes, 
SATA, 
or 
M.2 
compatibility that 
its pricier competitor 
offers. Take it out of the 
ecosystem entirely, and it even 
pales in comparison to that plucky 
blue, 
over-priced, 
under-runner 
from yesteryear.
What does that mean, exactly? To 
be frank, not a lot. Although Ryzen’s 
chipset does look somewhat weaker 
than its Intel counterparts, you have 
to take into account what people are 
actually making use of. For the vast 
majority, a single M.2 PCIe SSD, a full 
bank of SATA, and two GPUs running 
in x8/x8—that’s all you’re probably 
ever going to need. Especially when 
you take into consideration the fact 
that Nvidia isn’t even supporting 
more than two-way SLI anymore.

The AM4 PlATfoRM
AMD’s latest motherboards picked apart for your reading pleasure
The ChiPseTs
Ryzen has a total of five chipsets, each 
aimed at a different audience. There’s 
the top-end X370 chipset, featuring high-
end support for storage, NVMe devices, 
and overclocking by default. The B350 is 
a slightly slimmed down variant of X370, 
with SLI/Xfire disabled by default, but 
still coming overclocked. Then there’s the 
more budget-oriented A320, with even less 
USB support, and overclocking disabled. 
Finally, there are two unreleased chipsets 
we haven’t seen yet, designed to deal with 
small form factor devices: X300 and A300. 
Although we haven’t seen any X300 
or A300 motherboards, their position is 
AvAilAbiliTy
At the moment, availability isn’t stellar for 
the fledgling motherboards, with many 
AIB partners claiming that they weren’t 
given enough time or warning about the 
readiness of Ryzen processors. Most 
expected 1,000 chips in the first batch, with 
10,000 the following month. In fact, AMD 
launched with 10,000 chips, followed by 
over a million in the second batch. 
Right now, there are 16 X370 boards, 
ranging from $120 up to $330, all of them 
ATX; 19 B350 mobos, in a combination 
of ATX and microATX, available from $70 to 
$132; and a single A320 board, the Gigabyte 
GA-A320M-HD2, at $70.
Even though AMD has only just dropped Ryzen into our laps, 
the rumor mill is still churning away, suggesting that the 
redheaded company is planning to launch an HEDT variant 
of both its processors and chipsets later this year, around 
about the time Computex occurs in Taiwan. The theory is that 
these are going to be cut-back variants of AMD’s latest Naples 
server architecture. Coming in 16, 12, and 10-core variants, 
the processors should absolutely demolish video rendering 
and more CPU-intensive computational tasks.
If the chips are anything like their Naples counterparts, 
you can expect AMD to take advantage of that server-based 
infrastructure, forsaking the chipset, and instead opting 
for anywhere between 48 and 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes directly on 
chip. We’re still not absolutely sure whether this is going to 
be an LGA socket, like Naples, or operate on Ryzen’s more 
commonplace AM4 PGA socket solution…. But, why would we 
even need this new HEDT variant of Ryzen? Especially when 
the cores already compete so well with their ridiculously more 
expensive Intel competition? Well, in short, X399 would act as 
a bridge between the nonsensical server prowess of AMD’s 
Naples SoC platform and Ryzen’s X370 gaming/rendering 
aspirations. For those not interested in smashing out the 
frame rates, but rather rendering at a professional level, 
X399 should provide the key. In contrast to the Ryzen 7 1800X, 
these chips should offer quad-channel memory, better PCIe 
support, and far lower clocks, leading to increased power 
efficiencies in the process. 
For the time being, this is still all speculation, but consider 
our interest piqued if this does come to fruition. And to be quite 
frank, a 16-core Ryzen chip coming in at the same price as an 
Intel Core i7-6900K should demolish the competition when it 
comes to those highly demanding applications.

actually the most interesting question. 
Reason being, we’ve already seen Biostar 
produce an X370 ITX motherboard—
arguably one of the smallest mainstream 
form factors currently available to the 
computing ecosphere. So, we simply can’t 
tell at this point how these X300 and A300 
chipsets will fit into the climate. However, 
judging by the limited USB support, 
and almost non-existent SATA Express 
support, it could hint at an even smaller 
motherboard form factor coming down 
the pipeline, specifically for console-like 
devices. A potential possibility for the PS5 
or Xbox Two? Only time will tell.

The Good, The bAd, And The odd
Analyzing exactly what’s going on with AMD’s AM4 chipsets
The Good
From the get-go, it would seem that AMD 
is already on the back foot when it comes 
to chipset connectivity. Lacking PCIe 3.0 
lanes on the chipset, and with limited SATA 
and USB support (regardless of its USB 
3.1 additions), it doesn’t look particularly 
fabulous for team red. 
But then you have to ask, when has 
anyone ever used the full complement of 
motherboard connectivity? When you break 
it down, those looking to take advantage of 
10 or more SATA hard drives, multiple M.2 
PCIe SSDs, and so on are already looking 
at the higher-end platforms in the form of 
the X99 series and server-grade solutions. 
For the vast majority of consumers and 
anyone on a budget, a single M.2 PCIe SSD 
and four SATA 6Gb/s ports are more than 
enough for the lifetime of any system, even 
including any potential future upgrades 
and expansions. It’s why we quite often 
recommend the ITX form factor over ATX, 
purely because you simply don’t need that 
level of excess.
The true beauty of the AM4 platform 
stems once more from the processor itself. 
Although it’s not the first time we’ve seen a 
full complement of I/O directly on the chip, 
as opposed to the chipset, it’s the first time 
we’ve seen it available at such a low price 
point, with each and every Ryzen 7, 5, and 3 
series featuring 20 PCIe 3.0 lanes. Sixteen 
of those are dedicated to graphics, similar 
to Intel’s current design, and an additional 
four are isolated purely for NVMe or 
SATA devices, reducing latency between 
the device and the chip. 
The bAd
That said, even including the dedicated 
PCIe lanes on the chip, AMD is still lacking 
when it comes to general connectivity. 
With X99 retaining its heady title, purely 
through sheer force of will, and its vast 
arsenal of PCIe lanes and USB/SATA 
support, it’s still a major selling point for 
any 3D professional or artist. It’s likely 
that over the next year or two, we’ll see 
PCIe M.2 SSDs plummet in price, making 
a 500GB M.2 relatively close to good value 
for money. Running two PCIe SSDs in a 
single system represents an upgrade path 
that just isn’t available with the current 
generation of X370 motherboards, unless, 
of course, X399 drops sometime soon, or 
until we see the next generation of Ryzen 
chips: Ryzen 2.
In its own way, this lack of I/O support 
for the chipset is particularly interesting, 
because AMD has explicitly stated that it 
intends to keep that “upgrade the chip not 
the mobo” motto, retaining the AM4 socket 
for the entire lifetime of the architecture, 
until either DDR5 or PCIe 4.0 launches. 
This would suggest that, as connectivity 
standards have dramatically increased 
over the last few years, with no sign of 
stopping, it’s likely that with each new 
generation of AMD Zen core, we’ll see an 
update of all the associated chipsets, with 
either more I/O baked into the chipsets, or 
even more leveraged on to the processors.
That said, if you’re after the best of 
the best, you’re still stuck with Intel’s 
X99 platform, unless AMD’s X399 chipset 
platform becomes a reality. 
The odd
The AM4 socket and Ryzen represent the 
pinnacle of what AMD has managed to 
achieve with Zen. But there are two huge 
anomalies when it comes to the general 
platform: LGA and PGA. LGA stands for 
Land Grid Array—in short, the pins are 
located in the motherboard’s socket, not 
the processor. With PGA, Pin Grid Array, 
it’s the other way round.
Generally speaking, Intel has always 
been a solid advocate of the LGA solution. 
The biggest advantage of this comes 
down to the fact that it’s quite difficult 
to damage the processor, or for it to be 
trashed through shipping. With an LGA 
solution, the AIB partners, such as Asus, 
EVGA, MSI, and others, will likely RMA 
more motherboards, as the sockets get 
damaged in transit or through user error. 
In AMD’s case with PGA, the scenario is 
reversed. With the chip holding the pins, 
it’s highly unlikely that you’ll damage the 
motherboard, but more likely that the 
chip can be damaged, leading to more 
processors being sent back to AMD, and 
savings provided directly to the partners. 
The thing is, these standards aren’t 
owned by either company. And, in fact, with 
Ryzen, AMD is using both PGA and LGA for 
its processors—PGA for the 7 series and 
below, and LGA for its Naples SoC (System 
on Chip) server parts. There has been no 
official statement about why this is, but it’s 
a curious change nonetheless, something 
that may allude to a paradigm shift in 
AMD’s future processor lineup, way after 
Ryzen’s heyday.
X370 and B350 are king, but we really wish there were more I/O.
AMD’s PGA socket has been a staple for years, but is it about to end?

observed, and computational performance 
was well within margin of error. We did 
see some rather impressive low and peak 
power draw overall, but still couldn’t push 
our Ryzen 7 1800X sample any higher 
than the 4.0GHz across all eight cores 
that we’ve seen elsewhere. What really 
impressed, however, was the undervolting. 
We managed to net an impressive 1.2V 
on the V Core, dropping temperatures by 
10 degrees in the process. 
The real sweet spot of the Crosshair VI, 
though, lies in its vast arsenal of rear I/O. 
We’re talking two full banks of four USB 3.0 
ports, one bank of USB 2.0 ports, one USB 
3.1 type A, and one USB 3.1 Type C, alongside 
a BIOS reset switch, Intel Gigabit Ethernet, 
and 5.1 audio, with optical out. Couple that 
with the vast array of SATA and M.2 support 
buried on board, and it’s a genuine force to 
be reckoned with.
It does come in at a pretty hefty price 
premium of $255 overall, but for what 
you’re getting, it’s honestly one of the best—
if not the best—Ryzen motherboards out 
there to date. Cooling support is ample, 
overclocking prowess pretty prominent 
(more applying to higher-end memory kits), 
and the BIOS that Asus’s ROG division is 
pumping out is improving memory support 
by leaps and bounds. 
Asus is A behemoth of a company, split into 
different divisions dealing with graphics, 
peripherals, monitors, mobile devices, 
and everything else, with divisions upon 
divisions upon divisions, each with the aim 
of producing and maintaining products 
aimed at its own target audience. Take the 
motherboard division, for example. Inside 
this monumental substructure, you’ll find 
Republic of Gamers, TUF, WorkStation, 
and the Pro series of mobo teams. Each 
team working independently of one another, 
both in motherboard design and BIOS/
UEFI development.
Why do we bring this up? Well, it’s 
to do with motherboard choice. Not all 
Asus motherboards are born equal. This 
Crosshair VI, plied with the latest BIOS 
update, is a phenomenal piece of gear, 
more than capable of hitting higher than 
3,000MT/s memory overclocks, and one of 
the easiest plug-and-play kits we’ve seen. 
It’s nothing short of awe-inspiring. 
For anyone accustomed to overclocking 
on Z77 Asus motherboards and above, very 
little has changed, with all the same options 
readily available for those people who like to 
delve into the Digi+ Power Control settings 
within the BIOS.

R15, and Fry Render, and memory latency 
some of the highest we’ve seen.
As for aesthetics, there’s not a lot to talk 
about. Gigabyte has stuck with the familiar 
red, black, and silver color scheme we saw 
with the Z170 Intel series boards, with a 
chunky black heatsink near the rear I/O, and 
that’s about it. LED lighting is on board, with 
one single strip on the right. The feature set 
is, well, acceptable. There are four SATA 
3 ports, two PCIe x16 ports (bear in mind 
CrossFire and SLI are disabled on B350), 
and a single M.2 port for a full x4 PCIe SSD, 
if super-slick storage is your jam. Rear I/O 
is the absolute minimum, too, with hints 
of HDMI and DVI-I compatible processors 
coming down the line soon.
What’s the biggest positive we can draw 
from this? The price. For $110, it’s hard 
to argue with how cheap this is, and how 
easily you can jump on to the platform. 
Undoubtedly, over time, and with enough 
BIOS updates, you’ll probably see those 
supported memory frequencies rise. And 
hopefully more expansive BIOS options 
for those looking to tweak their chips a 
touch higher. That said, for now, if you’re 
looking for the best board to overclock on, 
you should go for one of the X370s—Asus’s 
Crosshair VI Hero or MSI’s X370 Gaming Pro 
Carbon, in particular, are swell clockers.
At lAst, we’ve witnessed AMD’s second 
chipset, the B350—team red’s answer 
to Intel’s H270. But is it strong enough to 
withstand the full brunt of Ryzen’s notorious 
bugs, while not being at the top of AMD’s 
pile of enthusiast boards? 
Gigabyte’s AB350-Gaming 3 is the first 
board we’ve tested under this new chipset, 
it was certainly an adventure. By default, 
the AB350 should be overclockable, but in 
our tests, we just couldn’t get that spark to 
ignite, no matter what settings we tinkered 
with in the rather limited OC BIOS. Memory 
support was also lacking. Even with the 
latest BIOS, our Corsair Vengeance kit was 
limited to 2,133MT/s. Of course, we could 
put this down to BIOS bugs, but we’re now 
two months into the Ryzen release, with 
Ryzen 5 chips just on launch, and 3 not far 
behind. So why aren’t these more budget-
centric AM4 offerings getting as much love 
as the top-end X370 ones from the same 
company? Your guess is as good as ours.
For each board we test, we check 
whether our memory kit will operate at 
3,000MT/s, then clock down to 2,666 for the 
rest of our benchmarks. The idea is to bring 
the spec more in line with what an average 
Ryzen system should look like. On the 
Gaming 3, we couldn’t do that, and it shows, 
with scores plummeting in X265, Cinebench

percent of the Asus Crosshair VI Hero in 
almost everything—except a slightly higher 
power draw. What really impressed was 
the phenomenally tight memory latency. 
AIDA64 saw latencies as low as 83ns, 
outperforming all the other boards on test.
We also cranked up the overclock to 
4GHz, as is the norm for our Ryzen 7 1800X. 
But when it came to undervolting, the 
Gaming 5 came undone. This was the first 
board on which we managed to kill a chip in 
this test. Admittedly, our mistake—during 
our undervolt testing, instead of placing 
the chip under 1.18V of V Core, we put it 
under 1.8V. Before proceeding to boot into 
Windows and benchmark the crap out of it. 
It was only when we heard the fan ramp up, 
and noticed the clock speeds registering at 
1GHz, that we realized what had occurred. 
We switched off the machine and returned 
to stock voltages in BIOS. Alas, one restart 
later, and poof—no more display. Yes, it was 
an error on our part, but it could have been 
prevented by overvoltage protection in the 
BIOS, a feature included in Asus’s Crosshair 
VI Hero and MSI’s XPower Gaming Titanium.
Ultimately, the Gaming 5 still offers great 
value, with solid stock performance, and 
looks that could kill. But if you’re tweaking 
those sweet overclocks, keep an eye on the 
voltage inputs, just in case.
GiGAbyte is the kinG of value when it 
comes to motherboards. Its crisp, sharp 
PCBs provide almost everything you could 
want, at a price that makes its competitors 
weep. It won our Z170 mobo roundup with 
its Gaming 5, and would have undoubtedly 
grabbed a victory among Z270 boards, too, 
if we’d delved into that minor update. Can 
the same be said for AMD’s latest platform?
Well, it’s off to a good start. The design is 
undeniably clean: The satin white finish on 
the heatsinks and rear I/O shield, coupled 
with the brushed aluminum and black PCB 
certainly make it look the part. The LED 
lighting is a little less subtle than we’d like, 
dotted around the VRMs near the socket, the 
onboard audio, PCIe slots, and DRAM. But 
the biggest block is the oddly transparent, 
jagged strip running down toward the neatly 
placed U.2 and SATA ports. Fortunately, you 
can remove it, or design your own piece of 
shiny acrylic to cover the LED-touting side. 
Or just switch it off. Yes, do that—switch off

Alas, when it comes to performance, the 
Gaming 5 took a little tweaking. The default 
BIOS failed to support our 3,000MT/s 
overclock, forcing us to clock down to 
2,666 until we got the new AGESA BIOS

the level of DAC and HRA, but for anyone 
simply wanting to plug and play, you’re 
unlikely to find much difference between 
motherboards. The Nahimic audio suite 
included with MSI’s lineup since the Z170 
series, on the other hand, is a force to be 
reckoned with. For those familiar with 
THX’s Crystalizer software, way back in 
the days of Windows 7, think of this as that 
on steroids.
On to performance, and the Gaming 
Pro Carbon actually outshone its XPower 
cousin in the X265 benchmark, Cinebench, 
and even Fry Render, by around 1 percent 
in most cases. Memory latency was fairly 
middle ground, with power draw being 
our overall winner, both under load and 
idling. We also managed a swift 3,000MT/s 
overclock on our 16GB Corsair Vengeance 
LPX kit as well—again, with the latest 
BIOS update. We can’t stress enough how 
important it is that you update your BIOS 
if you’re already using—or thinking about 
jumping on to—the AM4 platform.
Ultimately, MSI’s X370 Gaming Pro 
Carbon is one of the best value boards 
out there. If you’re looking for all the 
connectivity and features that Ryzen has to 
offer in an affordable package, and aren’t 
too bothered about appearances, the Pro 
Carbon is definitely the board for you.
GiGAbyte’s GAminG 5 series has generally 
always been the value king, but it might 
need to rethink its game plan with the likes 
of MSI dropping this sweet little number 
on to the AMD playing field. It may not 
have as clean a look as Gigabyte’s mighty 
Aorus lineup, but it’s hard to deny that the 
connectivity is there. Sort of.
Well, OK, so you lose out on a few banks 
of SATA 3, there’s no U.2, and it’s still prone 
to MSI’s haphazard butchery of the rear I/O, 
but all in all, it’s a well specced board for 
anyone looking to build a fairly entry-level 
Ryzen rig, even featuring DVI-I for those 
future APUs that might come out soon 
(seriously, we don’t know). All joking aside, 
couple this with a Ryzen 5 1600, and you’re 
looking at a six-core, 12-thread, DDR4-
touting overclockable workstation base for 
a little under $400. 
So, aesthetics. Yeah, it’s covered in a 
carbon fiber finish. We’re not sure why. 
Honestly, do motherboards benefit from 
being lighter? (Spoiler: It’s not carbon fiber.) 
It’s a controversial checkered finish that 
you’ll either love or hate. On the other hand, 
the black finish across the board is swell, 
and the RGB lighting is easy to configure to 
any color you want in MSI’s desktop app. 
Onboard audio across the brands 
right now is pretty solid. Not quite up to

Crosshair VI Hero. With three USB 3.1 type 
A ports, one USB 3.1 type C, two USB 2.0, 
and the usual 5.1 audio and Intel Gigabit 
Ethernet, it doesn’t quite compete with its 
Pegasus-inspired counterpart. However, 
it’s the inclusion of two ports in particular 
that caught our eye: A DisplayPort 1.2 and 
HDMI 2.0 port are nestled next to a right-
angled USB 2.0 diagnostic hub, indicating 
that processors with integrated graphics 
are on their way.
Performance is what you’d expect. 
There’s very little variance between any 
of the motherboards here. One notable 
exception is the idle power draw, topping 
out at 61W, making it one of the highest. 
Additionally, X265 took a bit of a hit, 
compared to almost all of the other boards 
we tested—intriguing, because the memory 
was 
registering 
accurately 
at 
2,666. 
Speaking of memory, although latencies 
still remain higher than on the Intel 
platform, thanks to the new AGESA code 
handed out by AMD, and some succulent 
BIOS updates, we’ve seen higher frequency 
memory kits work well across most of the 
X370 lineup, the XPower Gaming Titanium 
being no exception.
Ultimately, if you’re after a board with 
glitz and glam, the XPower X370 Gaming 
Titanium has it in spades.

age-old fight. Red versus blue, Intel versus 
AMD, Microsoft versus Apple. And no more 
does it exist than between Asus and MSI. 
More blood has been shed between these 
two companies than most people realize. 
They’re the industry titans, continually 
goading one another to even headier heights 
than the last, and nowhere is this more 
apparent than with MSI’s X370 XPower

has to muster on AMD’s new platform.

we knew this supertest was going to be 
a turbulent one, because of how brand new 
architectures tend to operate, so we cast our net 
wide from the start, but that didn’t prevent a few 
headaches along the way.
Taking a cross section from MSI, Asus, and 
Gigabyte, we originally chose nine motherboards, 
both X370 and B350, before whittling the list down 
to five. Four boards didn’t make it through—three 
due to testing failures, and one simply didn’t 
arrive in time. 
Notable mentions: the Asus Prime X370-
Pro and the MSI B350 Tomahawk. We spoke 
briefly earlier about how each section of Asus’s 
massive structure is broken down into individual 
teams, with each part working autonomously—
unfortunately, not all parts are equal. ROG vastly 
outshines the Pro team when it comes to BIOS 
stability—in fact, we bricked two Prime X370-
Pros. One during the initial Ryzen launch via a 
BIOS update, and the replacement died following a 
similar event (although it made it past the update, 
failing to boot Windows). With the Tomahawk, 
we didn’t even make it to BIOS, unfortunately, 
regardless of what configuration we used. That’s 
not to say these motherboards are a no-go area, 
just that if you’re thinking of buying cheap, yet 
still want to push the boundaries when it comes 
to running above stock 2,133MT/s or processor 
overclocks, it might be worth holding off for a 
month or two longer.
For the time being, it seems Ryzen’s top-end 
chipset has had most of the bugs ironed out, at 
least for the more premium lines associated 
with each brand. However, the budget-oriented 
options may need a little extra time. 
Our testing setup consisted of an AMD Ryzen 
7 1800X, 16GB (2x 8GB) of Corsair Vengeance 
LPX DDR4 capable of clocking up to 3,000MT/s 
(provided by AMD), an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, 
a Samsung 850 Evo 250GB OS drive, with a clean 
install of Windows 10, plus an ADATA SX8000 
256GB PCIe SSD to test out the M.2 ports, and you 
can see how each board performed below.

impressed us: Asus’s Crosshair VI Hero 
and MSI’s X370 Gaming Pro Carbon. The 
Hero was the first board we got hands-on 
with during our Ryzen testing, and it’s not 
difficult to understand why AMD chose 
to ship this one out to us. Its ease of use, 
support for high-end memory from the 
get-go, and in-depth UEFI BIOS made it a 
breeze for most reviewers not wanting to  
dig more than skin deep into AMD’s 
latest platform.
However, it’s the Gaming Pro Carbon that 
really stole the show. Coming in at $80 less 
than the Crosshair VI Hero, and packing 
that vital core performance, its stability, 
memory support, and overall feature set 
are more than enough for anyone looking to 
sate their eight-core desires. That carbon 
finish? Well, it’s certainly different. Let’s 
call it that. OK, MSI, truthfully: We don’t like 
this finish. Keep it black, have a brushed 
whAt A roller coAster this has been. At the 
start, we knew it wasn’t going to be easy—
and we were right. Three motherboards, 
one chip, and this reviewer’s soul have 
been claimed by the beast of bedlam that is 
Ryzen’s monstrous new AM4 platform. 
On paper, Ryzen and its new chipsets 
are sound. Logical even. After all, the vast 
majority of I/O included on modern mobos 
goes untouched by mainstream users. 
And despite Ryzen’s seemingly high-end, 
professional heritage, its price point puts it 
in the realm of the average joe. The rumored 
X399 platform, hopefully coming soon, 
should be a re-envisioned HEDT variant of 
Ryzen, with a far more expansive chipset 
(hopefully mostly on the processor), but for 
now, this is what we have to play with.
AM4 is still in its infancy, and so are the 
chips. For the vets out there, who remember 
the early days of Hyper-Threading, and even 
Nehalem’s launch, the teething problems 
will come as no surprise. So, don’t let this 
put you off investing in the Ryzen platform, 
because the bugs are being ironed out at a 
phenomenal rate. It seems every new BIOS 
update improves performance and stability 
at a rate of knots.
So, on to the motherboards. Two of the 
boards in this issue’s supertest particularly 
aluminum styling on it, clean it up, keep the 
lines straight and the MSI logo sharp, and 
you’d be on to a classic. But the checkered 
carbon look? Not for us.
But back to the biggest positive of 
them all: the price. There’s $80 difference 
between the Crosshair VI and this beauty. 
With that saving, you could upgrade from 
a six-core Ryzen 5 1600X to an eight-core 
Ryzen 7 1700. Whack that clock speed up to 
4GHz, and you’d easily be rolling above the 
1800X, and within spitting distance of Intel’s 
Core i7-6950X.
Ultimately, AMD’s AM4 platform, for the 
time being at least, is still a touch messy. Go 
with boards you know you can trust, search 
around to find the best deals, and don’t get 
scalped. And if you’re really keen to become 
an early adopter, make sure you stick to the 
premium lines from mobo manufacturers, 
otherwise you’re likely to get burned. 
Its stability, memory support, and overall 
feature set are more than enough for anyone 
looking to sate their eight-core desires.

The second major update to Windows 10 has just 
dropped. Here’s all you need to know. By Matt Hanson
WindoWs 10  
CreaTors  
UpdaTe
ExplainEd
When WindoWs 10 launched in July 2015, 
it was met with acclaim—and also a fair 
amount of relief—because it was a marked 
improvement over its predecessor, Windows 
8.  However, it still wasn’t a perfect operating 
system, and Microsoft appears to have 
acknowledged this by releasing two major 
updates for it: The first, the Anniversary 
Update, hit our PCs last year, and now the 
Creators Update is currently rolling out to 
PCs around the world as you read this.
Windows updates are rarely worth getting 
excited about, but the number of tweaks, 
fixes, and new features that Microsoft 
has promised with this release makes it 
worth downloading. As the name suggests, 
Microsoft has focused on bolstering the 
creative aspects of Windows 10. However, 
if you have less creative juice flowing 
through you than a heap of rocks does, the 
good news is that Microsoft has a rather 
liberal interpretation of what it means to  
be a “Creator,”
So, it’s not just people who like to put 
stylus to Surface and create digital art—it 
also applies to people who play games and 
like to stream and share their gameplay 
with friends and strangers across the 
Internet. Of course, there is also the usual 
array of less glamorous (and arguably more 
essential) security and usability tweaks 
to make Windows 10 an all-around better 
piece of software to use. In this article, we’re 
looking at how you can download and install 
the Creators Update, why you would want 
to, what cool new features you’ll be getting, 
and how to use them. Windows 10 still isn’t 
perfect, but with major free updates such as 
the Creators Update, it shows that Microsoft 
is committed to evolving and improving 
its operating system, which is definitely 
something worth celebrating.

Video game streaming is incredibly popular, 
with Twitch gaining 100 million monthly 
unique users watching over 2 million monthly 
streamers since it launched in 2011, with 
around 241 billion minutes of content being 
broadcast, so it’s little wonder that Microsoft 
is so keen to get involved. It has done this by 
acquiring the Beam service last year, and 
integrating it into Windows 10’s Creators 
Update and the Xbox One. Classic Microsoft.
Of course, with the success of Twitch 
and other established services, Microsoft 
has an uphill struggle to convince people to 
move from their preferred service to Beam. 
However, it has a few tricks up its sleeve. 
For a start, it has a focus on super low 
latency, something Microsoft is describing 
as the “Beam Faster than Light SDK,” which 
allows for broadcasting with virtually no 
latency. By having almost no perceptible 
pause between the action in the game the 
broadcaster is playing and what the audience 
sees, it makes conversations between the 
broadcaster and the audience even better. 
You could now tell a broadcaster to look out 
behind them, and they’d react, rather than 
telling them, only to find out three seconds 
later that they are already dead.
Microsoft also plans for Beam to have 
a full suite of interactive elements for 
its streams. These range from simple 
soundboard apps (which allow viewers 
to trigger specific sound effects) that can 
be applied to any game, through to more 
complex interactive elements, introduced as 
part of Microsoft’s “Interactive 2.0” initiative, 
launched at GDC earlier this year.
When implemented into a game, these 
features (combined with the low latency) 
will enable viewers to be almost as involved 
in the action as the streamers themselves, 
“blurring the lines between playing and 
watching,” as Microsoft puts it.
Beam: Tools for 
BroadcasTing
Use the Windows 10 Update Assistant to manually download and install the update.
geT The creaTors UpdaTe
The Windows 10 Creators Update is a free 
download for every Windows 10 user. The 
good news is that this means at some point 
in the future, your PC will let you know that 
the update is ready to be downloaded and 
installed. All you need to do is make sure 
your work (or any game progress) is saved, 
then let Windows Update do its thing.
However, to stop the millions of Windows 
10 users all trying to download the rather 
hefty update all at once, and potentially 
breaking part of the Internet, Microsoft is 
rolling out the update to PCs around the 
world in waves, and it’s been a bit coy about 
how long this rollout process will take. 
So, you might get the Creators Update in 
the next few days, or you may have to wait 
weeks—even months—before it appears in 
Windows Update.
However, like the Good News Fairy that 
we are (think the Tooth Fairy, but with a beer 
belly and faded Half Life 2 T-shirt), we have 
more glad tidings: There’s a way to manually 
update to the Creators Update yourself, so 
you don’t have to wait for the rollout.
To manually download Windows 10 
Creators Update, head to the Windows 
10 Update Assistant web page (www.
microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/
windows10), then click “Update now.”
The tool downloads, then checks for 
the latest version of Windows 10, which 
includes the Creators Update.
Once downloaded, run it, then select 
“Update Now.” The tool does the rest for 
you. Your PC restarts a few times—so 
make sure you save your work first—and 
then your PC is updated with the Creators 
Update, while all your files and settings 
remain where they were.
That 
website 
also 
allows 
you 
to  
download an ISO image, which you can then 
use to update your current installation of 
Windows 10, or perform a clean install with 
the Creators Update.
WhaT’s neW?
With the Creators Update installed, what 
new features await you? Well, one of the 
most exciting additions is a new program 
called 3D Paint. We know what you’re 
thinking: Who cares about a new version 
of Microsoft Paint? And who still cares 
about 3D? We were as surprised as you are, 
after meeting Microsoft to see Creators 
Update before it launched, to come away so 
impressed by this new app. 
3D Paint, like its 2D counterpart (which 
remains its own separate program), grants 
simple tools for people to create their own 
artwork. What’s particularly impressive 
about 3D Paint is that the concept of 
creating models in a 3D space can be 
quite complicated, but 3D Paint makes the 
process incredibly simple, with the tools 
Beam wants to make 
watching “Let’s Play” 
streams more interactive.

Edge has been given an overhaul, and using tabs is now better than ever.
Game Mode is perhaps the feature that 
generated the most amount of buzz ahead of 
the launch of the Creators Update. So much 
so, that Microsoft actually had to downplay 
expectations, worried that people were 
getting their hopes up too high.
So, what is Game Mode? It can be toggled 
from the Game Bar (Windows-G on your 
keyboard brings this up), and it tells your 
system to reallocate CPU and GPU hardware 
resources to prioritize the game at hand 
when it’s the active, full-screen application.
The results, as Microsoft claims, are 
steadier frame rates than before, notably 
with games that particularly tax a given 
system’s resources. The idea is that if 
you’re playing a game and recording it in the 
background—or you have another intensive 
task running while you play—Game Mode 
tells Windows 10 to prioritize your game, 
so you don’t see major dips in frame rates. 
Unlike what some people were hoping—that 
Game Mode would strip down background 
apps and tasks while you’re playing, to give 
you hefty boosts to FPS—Microsoft was 
keen to stress that the results are about 
stabilizing frame rates, not boosting them. 
Microsoft also warns that Game Mode brings 
the most benefit to systems that aren’t 
absolutely optimized for gaming, so if you 
have an all-powerful rig packed with Titan 
Xp GPUs, you won’t see much difference. 
Both Universal Windows Platform (UWP) 
and Win32 games support Game Mode. 
Microsoft keeps an internal list of games for 
this feature, and others related to gaming, 
which we’re told is updated more frequently 
than Windows itself.
There’s no word on how many games—
Win32 or UWP—support the feature, but 
we get the impression that the number is 
enormous. A select, growing number of 
games—regardless of whether they’re UWP 
or Win32—will see the feature automatically 
enabled. Of course, disabling Game Mode on 
a game is as easy as enabling it.
Game Mode: 
Too Good to 
Be True?
it offers appearing very straightforward 
at first, but powerful enough to create 
some impressive 3D works once you’re 
comfortable using them.
These creations can be exported and 
viewed on normal PCs, or added to VR and 
AR applications to be viewed in 3D. Plus, 
if you have a 3D printer hooked up to your 
PC, it’s incredibly easy to print off your 
creations. It’s difficult to explain in writing, 
but trust us: Load up 3D Paint and have 
a play around—it may just be your new 
favorite application.
Microsoft’s renewed love of 3D extends 
beyond 3D Paint to PowerPoint (for 3D 
models and 3D animations, to make 
presentations slightly less dull), and the 
default Edge web browser, which now 
supports 3D content, and plays nicely with 
3D files exported from various programs, 
such as Minecraft, SketchUp, and, of 
course, 3D Paint.
While 3D displays are now out of vogue, 
mixed reality—just like virtual reality and 
augmented reality—is the hot new thing, 
and it is these technologies that have 
rekindled Microsoft’s 3D passion. Under 
the name “Windows Mixed Reality,” which 
used to be called “Windows Holographic,” 
this is a mixed reality platform built by 
Microsoft on the Windows 10 API, and it is 
now heavily integrated into the Windows 10 
Creators Update.
It means that you can create your own 
3D model (or simply download an existing 
one), and then easily place it into a real or 
virtual world using a VR or AR headset. 
While Microsoft’s own AR headset Hololens 
is a pricey proposition, Microsoft also 
announced last year that it is working with a 
number of headset manufacturers to bring 
third-party AR and VR headsets to Windows 
10 machines. A new app, the Mixed Reality 
Portal, is included with the Creators Update 
to show you exactly what Windows 10 is 
capable of.
a focUs on games
Microsoft promising that it still cares about 
PC gaming, while chasing the shiny Xbox 
bauble, is something that a lot of us have 
heard many times before. At least with the 
Creators Update, it seems like Microsoft 
may be making some positive moves.
In the Windows 10 Settings app, there 
is a new addition: Gaming. This setting 
enables you to control many aspects of how  
Windows 10 handles games. Its most 
talked-about feature is the new Game 
Mode option, which helps your PC maintain 
solid frame rates as you play, while other 
background tasks and applications run. 
We go into more detail in the boxout on the 
right, but you can turn the feature on and off 
from the Gaming settings page. 
The Game DVR settings page enables 
you to control how you take screenshots 
and record gameplay videos. While there’s 
a number of programs that enable you to 
record and share videos, such as Nvidia’s 
ShadowPlay, Microsoft hopes that by baking 
this functionality into Windows 10, you’re 
more likely to use its offering, especially 
as it’s so easy to configure and begin 
recording. Microsoft also argues that by 
using Windows 10 to record your gameplay, 
rather than third-party software, your PC 
will have more resources at its disposal, 
which in turn should give you more 
consistent and stable frame rates when you 
play games while recording.
Among the new Game DVR settings is the 
ability to turn audio recording on (and off), if 
you want to provide narration, and you can 
choose the frame rates and video quality 
from here as well.

settings from this window. In the Creators

Update, Microsoft is looking to seriously up 
the reach of, and community around, games 
played on Windows 10 with a new feature 
called Beam. An acquisition recently made 
by the firm, Beam is a PC game streaming 
and broadcasting platform, similar to 
Twitch, replete with its own streaming 
network via web browser, converted into 
a baked-in Game Bar feature (which can 
be brought up by pressing Windows-G on 
your keyboard).
Beam’s major claim to fame here, 
though, is that it maintains sub-second 
latency from the broadcaster’s executions 
in-game to those moments being displayed 
on your PC screen via stream. In other 
words, for broadcasters, this reduction 
in the time between what you’re doing in-
game and your viewers seeing it makes 
interacting that much more interesting.
Broadcasting 
via 
Beam 
is 
made 
incredibly simple in the Creators Update—
all you need to do is open up the Game Bar, 
click the “Broadcast” icon, then just a few 
clicks and toggles after that, and you’re 
broadcasting to Beam viewers worldwide. 
That’s after creating a Beam account, as 
well as an Xbox Live account, if you haven’t 
already. Once again, this is a sign that, as 
good as the new features ushered in by the 
Creators Update are, many of them require 
you to be fully signed up to Microsoft’s 
ecosystem. If you’re not too keen on 
Microsoft’s recent direction, you may not 
be a huge fan of this. It is, after all, also 
doubling down on the Windows Store and 
UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps 
for games.
oTher feaTUres
There’s a load of other features included 
in the Creators Update, and while they 
aren’t as headline-grabbing as Game Mode 
and mixed reality support, their addition 
definitely makes Windows 10 a better 
operating system.
Take Night Light, for example. It’s 
Microsoft’s answer to Night Shift on 
As we mentioned elsewhere, Paint 3D 
is genuinely one of the most impressive 
additions included with the Creators 
Update. When seeing it first-hand, creating 
three-dimensional pieces of art truly is as 
simple as Microsoft demonstrated at the 
update’s reveal event last year.
Then again, it’s clear that this app has 
the capacity to allow for quite a bit of 
complexity, too. Most of that simplicity 
comes down to how intuitively the app 
communicates three dimensions in a two-
dimensional space. Clever, minimalist use 
of sliders and other toggles enables you to 
shift your creation’s position on either axis.
Of course, a wide selection of pre-loaded 
creation templates—such as goldfish—will 
help newcomers out immensely. Naturally, 
it wouldn’t be Paint without the ability to 
freehand in 3D, and thus comes the desire 
to share those custom creations. That’s 
where Remix.com, Microsoft’s online 
portal for sharing these Paint 3D projects, 
comes into play.
The way in which Paint 3D communicates 
how to create in a new dimension so easily 
for the average user, yet offers the depth to 
please them as they increase in skill, could 
do a lot of good for the 3D printing scene, as 
well as VR, and so many other fields further 
down the road—such as being able to add 
our creations to games.
Granted, Paint 3D is by no means a 
professional-grade 3D modeling app—this 
is purely meant for the vast majority of 
Windows 10 users who would just like 
to dabble. You can also export anything 
created in Paint 3D as 3D-ready FBX or 3MF 
files for 3D printers.
Regardless, we’re already impressed 
with what Paint 3D can do, and only hope it 
grows from here. Oh, and don’t worry, the 
old Paint remains untouched.

According to Microsoft’s own testing, Edge is the least battery-intensive browser.
A new Gaming section has been added to the Windows Settings app.

macOS Sierra, and it is an effective and 
welcome feature for people who tend to 
use computers at all hours of the night. It 
lowers the amount of blue light your PC 
emits though its display, which can play 
havoc with your internal clock.
What’s even better than the competing 
solutions is how Night Light enables you 
to adjust the tone of the color change, in 
addition to the standard setting of whether 
the mode kicks in at sunset local time, or 
activates within set hours.
Microsoft has also thrown a lot of new 
features at its Edge browser in a bid to make 
us ditch Chrome and Firefox. As well as 
the aforementioned support for 3D media, 
it also includes a genuinely useful tab 
preview bar that gives you a visual overview 
of all your currently open tabs, so you can 
quickly and easily switch between the ones 
you need. This is a great addition for those 
of us who usually end a browsing session 
on the Internet with an unwieldy number of 
tabs open.
You can also “set tabs aside,” which is 
Microsoft speak for saving open tabs as 
a collection, which you can then open and 
restore later. 
Edge has often felt a little neglected 
when it comes to add-ons and extensions, 
with popular ones on Firefox and Chrome 
often skipping Microsoft’s latest browser. 
The company is looking to fix that with 
the Creators Update, by bringing a large 
number of popular add-ons and extensions 
to Edge. 
Microsoft has also worked hard on 
making Edge as lightweight as possible, 
which means that if you’re browsing the 
web on a laptop or tablet, Edge should 
be less taxing on your device’s battery, 
which should mean more time before your 
machine dies. 
To prove its point, Microsoft has released 
a battery test video comparison, showing 
the staying power of the three most popular 
browsers side-by-side, pitting its own Edge 
offering against Google’s Chrome and 
Mozilla’s Firefox.
The test was a simple one: which 
browser could last the longest while 
streaming full-screen video from Vimeo. 
Given that Microsoft is keen for you to see 
the results, there’s no prizes for guessing 
which browser came out on top—yep, 
Microsoft Edge.
Edge didn’t just, well, edge the test 
either. Instead, it dominated proceedings, 
lasting a full 35 percent longer than Google 
Chrome, and a massive 77 percent longer 
than Firefox.
While Firefox lasted just 7 hours and 
4 minutes before conking out, Chrome 
managed a full 9 hours and 17 minutes 
of streaming.
Microsoft’s Edge browser, which has 
been specially tuned for the new Windows 
10 Creators Update, just kept on chugging, 
eventually notching up 12 hours and 31 
minutes of streaming time before finally 
calling it a day.
In terms of fairness, the three browsers 
were each made to run on identical Surface 
Book machines, each powered by Intel’s 
2.4GHz Core i5-6300U processor, 8GB of 
RAM, and Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU.
Ensuring further parity, each device was 
muted, had brightness set to 75 percent, 
Bluetooth and location disabled, and the 
Quiet Hours functionality switched on.
To be honest, it’s not quite enough 
for us to make the leap from our trusted 
browsers to Edge just yet, but it looks like it 
is definitely going in the right direction.
privacy
As good as Windows 10 is, there were 
concerns around the default privacy 
settings it shipped with, with many people 
worried about the kind of data—and 
control—to which Microsoft has access. 
The company has been aware of these 
criticisms, and it has responded by trying to 
make it more transparent what kind of data 
it collects in the Creators Update—as well 
as making it easier for you to change any 
privacy setting you don’t like. 
When you update Windows 10 to the 
Creators Update, you’ll see a screen asking 
you to choose the privacy settings of your 
device. The options are for “Location,” 
“Diagnostics,” “Relevant Ads,” “Speech 
Recognition,” and “Tailored Experiences 
with Diagnostic Data.” Each option has a 
“Learn more” button that you should click to 
get a full explanation about what it affects. 
In our eyes, this is a very positive step that 
Microsoft has taken, and while we’d rather 
most of those settings were off by default, 
we’re glad that Microsoft has explained 
each setting thoroughly, so that you are 
mostly in control of your privacy when using 
Windows 10 Creators Update. 
The Creators Update brings more compatibility with “mixed reality” devices.
You can also use your device as an ereader, with built-in support for ebooks.

Why no one has 
ever thought of this 
before is beyond us: a 
pre-installed rear I/O 
shield. It’s simple. Just 
position the empty 
bracket prior to

no messing around 
trying to line both up. 
Couple that with dual 
Ethernet ports, dual 
USB 3.1 Type C, USB 
3.1 Type A, four USB

additional USB ports 
for both KEYBOT and

HigH-End dEsktop: that’s the name of the game with this 
little beauty. X99 2011-3 Broadwell-e processors adorn 
this motherboard to create one mighty combination of 
processing prowess. It’s certainly no slouch—but packing 
support for U.2, M.2, 10 SaTa 6Gb/s ports, and a whole 
heap of rear I/O means this motherboard comes in at an 
incredibly pricey $600.
So, why invest in the platform? especially with 
Ryzen kicking Intel to the curb with its latest octo-core 
processors? Well, it’s all down to that chipset. If you’re 
looking for the best, Broadwell-e’s support for up to 40 
PCIe 3.0 lanes on the processors themselves makes any 
combination of graphics and PCIe SSD solution viable, 
running at full speed, with no bottlenecks.
On top of all of that, you get a tried and tested platform, 
used around the globe in professional render houses, 
design studios, and so forth. Which leads us on nicely to 
the fact that this board is purely for enthusiasts, for those 
looking for the best possible system that money can 
muster. You’re likely to find this motherboard only in the 
highest of high-end liquid-cooled dream machines and 
gaming systems.
and with good reason, because it’s a truly beautiful piece 
of art. The sleek black design, subtly accented by the RGB 
LeDs in both the chipset and the VRM heatsinks, makes 
this an exceptionally clean-looking motherboard. With its 
vast range of hardware support, superior audio, wireless 
a/C, reinforced backplate, and overclocking potential, it’s 
a sure-fire bet to say that this must be the best-equipped 
motherboard we’ve ever clapped eyes on. –ZAk stoREY

Set up this slick Linux OS alongside Windows 
By Nick Peers
E
ver wanted to dip your toe into 
Linux, but felt put off by the user 
experience? It’s time to confront 
your fear. Linux isn’t as impenetrable as it 
looks, with Ubuntu providing a very user-
friendly approach to getting started.
Ubuntu is a great flavor of Linux, but 
one of its biggest achievements has been 
to pioneer a host of off-shoot distros that 
focus on providing a more welcoming 
environment for those wishing to switch 
from other OSes. One obvious example 
is Linux Mint, an Ubuntu-derivative 
that uses the Cinnamon desktop to 
provide a Windows 7-like experience for 
switchers. Another—as you’re about to 
discover—is Elementary OS.
Elementary is based on Ubuntu 16.04 
LTS, and is perfect for those who like 
their OSes to look sleek and modern. It’s 
particularly attractive to Mac switchers, 
but while we’ll touch on how you can 
install Elementary alongside OS X, our 
primary focus is configuring it in a dual-
boot setup with Windows.
First, we’ll show you how to repartition 
your hard drive to split off your data 
from Windows itself—this means you 
can access your personal files easily 
from either OS via a shared partition. 
You’ll then build your Elementary 
install media, and we’ll then step you 
through the install process. It’s usually 
straightforward, but we’ve got your back 
covered in case it proves trickier than it 
should be.
We’re not going to just abandon you 
at the Elementary login screen either—
there’s time for a quick tour of the 
Elementary desktop, plus we’ll reveal 
how to get started with the Terminal, 
and even replace the boring GRUB boot 
loader with something a little more 
visually appealing (not to mention 
more practical).
One final thing: Before diving in, give 
Elementary a test drive first in a safe 
environment. You can do this from the 
install media—choose “Try Elementary” 
at the main screen—or by installing 
Elementary in a virtual machine using 
the likes of VirtualBox (which you can 
download 
from 
www.virtualbox.org) 
for a more in-depth play. Once you’re 
hooked, turn the page to start installing 
and using Elementary as your brand new 
operating system.

efore you can dive in and install 
Elementary, 
there’s 
a 
bit 
of 
preparatory work to do. Take a 
drive image—so you can roll back if things 
go wrong—and then prepare to separate 
your data from your Windows drive. The 
simplest way to share data between 
Windows and Elementary is through a 
shared data drive, whether that’s a separate 
physical drive or a separate partition.
Once set up, you’ll move across your key 
user folders—”Documents,” “Pictures,” 
and so on—to this drive, and update the 
references, so Windows knows where to 
look for your data going forward.
PartitiON 
yOur  
drivE
If you’re not using a 
separate 
physical 
drive to store your 
data, right-click the 
“Start” button, and 
choose “Disk Management.” Locate your 
Windows drive (this is typically drive C on 
Disk 0), then right-click that, and choose 
“Shrink Volume.”
Windows calculates how much free 
space it can give you—this may not tally 
with the total amount of free space on the 
drive, though, because of unmovable files. 
If you’re adamant that you should be able 
to free up more space, but can’t due to 
Disk Management’s limitations, you need 
to use a third-party partitioning tool, such 
as Minitool Partition Wizard Free (www.
partitionwizard.com). 
If you’re lacking free space due to 
the presence of files already on the 
drive, consider moving the largest ones 
temporarily off the drive to your backup 
drive, in order to free up enough space 
for your new partition. Use a tool such as 
WizTree (http://antibody-software.com) to 
help identify these, move them, and then 
restart the process.
Don’t forget to free up enough space to 
accommodate Elementary, as well as your 
data—if you’re installing everything on the 
same drive, Elementary always looks to 
place itself after your data partition. As a 
general rule of thumb, Windows needs a 
minimum of 32GB to run comfortably, but 
you’ll soon run out of space, so you should 
look to ensure your Windows partition is 
at least 50GB in size, and much larger if 
you play a lot of games. The rest is then 
allocated to your data partition and—
eventually—Elementary.
Here’s an example. You have a 512GB 
hard drive. You could look to allocate around 
150GB for Windows, leaving you 350GB for 
your data partition and Elementary. When 
you come to resize your partition, Windows 
asks you how much space you wish to shrink 
the partition by—in other words, how much 
space do you want to reserve for your other 
partitions? It’s a bit awkward, because it 
lists the figure in MB rather than GB, so to 
free up 350GB of space, you need to enter 
B
a figure like “350000” into the “Enter the 
amount of space to shrink in MB:” box.
Once done, click “Shrink,” and wait for 
Windows to complete the process. You 
then see “Unallocated” space appear in the 
“Disk Management” window—right-click it, 
and choose “New Simple Volume.” Follow 
the wizard, allocating all available space 
for now, assigning it a drive letter, and 
formatting using the NTFS filesystem. Give 
it a suitable label, such as “Data,” and your 
new partition is ready to go.

fOLdErS
It’s time to move 
your key user folders 
to the new partition. 
Open File Explorer, 
browse to “This PC,” 
then right-click each of your user folders in 
turn, and choose “Properties > Location 
tab.” Click “Move,” then browse to your data 
drive (consider creating a user folder inside 
which you then create subfolders for 
“Documents” and your other folders), select 
the new target folder, and click “OK.” When 
prompted, click “Yes” to move your data 
across to the new partition. Once complete, 
you can then move any files you’d previously 
copied off the drive back on to it.
The Elementary desktop is 
quite something to behold.

The moment of truth 
has arrived. It’s now 
time 
to 
install 
Elementary 
itself. 
The process will be 
familiar to anyone who’s dabbled with 
Ubuntu Linux—it’s practically identical. 
Start by booting with your bootable media 
inserted—if it’s not automatically detected, 
reboot, and look for an option to access your 
boot menu at the beginning of startup; 
typically it involves pressing a key such as 
F10 or F11.
When the boot menu appears, look for 
your USB device—you may see two entries, 
in which case, select the one marked 
“UEFI.” Once the install wizard appears, 
verify “English” is selected, and click 
“Install Elementary.” If necessary, connect 
to your Wi-Fi network when prompted, then 
check both the “Download updates” and 
“Install third-party software” boxes, before 
clicking “Continue.”
If all is well, your Windows installation 
should 
be 
detected—leave 
“Install 
Elementary 
alongside 
Windows 
10” 
selected, and click “Continue.” First, verify 
that Elementary has selected the correct 
disk to install itself on to—if you have more 
than one internal hard drive, it may attempt 
to install itself on the second drive. (If this is 
the case, you have two choices: either click 
“Back,” and skip to the “Manual Partitioning” 
section below, or power off your PC, open it 
Use the terminal
Elementary’s gorgeous visuals belie 
the fact that—underneath it all—you’re 
running an offshoot of Ubuntu Linux. Linux 
is a powerful operating system, and to 
really get to grips with it, you need to start 
familiarizing yourself with the Terminal, 
which gives you direct access to Linux’s 
underlying shell. You can open it via the 
“Applications” menu, or simply press 
Win-T to bring it up.
Here’s your first useful set of 
commands—we find the App Center can 
sometimes hang, but you can update 
Elementary and all your installed apps 
directly using the following commands:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get upgrade
The next set of commands install the 
Grub Customizer tool, which enables you to 
tweak the GRUB boot loader (for example, 
to change the default operating system 
back to Windows 10, if you prefer):
 $ sudo apt-get install software- 
 properties-common && sudo  
 apt-get update
 $ sudo add-apt-repository  
 ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install grub-customizer
Once complete, launch Grub Customizer 
from the “Applications” menu, and move 
Windows 10 to the top of the list, to make it 
the default choice.
The Terminal—and underlying Linux 
shell—uses the BASH language. It’s quite 
simple to pick up, and you’ll find lots of 
built-in help to get you started. Use the 
following command to start familiarizing 
yourself with the Terminal:
 $ man intro
up, temporarily disconnect the second hard 
drive, and try the install process again. Once 
Elementary is installed, reconnect the drive.)
Assuming you’re happy with the choice 
of drive, Elementary attempts to allocate 
itself around half of all available space, but 
you can use the slider to alter this as you 
see fit. For a basic Elementary installation, 
25GB should be ample, but if you plan to 
run games on it, you’ll want to give yourself 
plenty of extra breathing room—50GB or 
even more. Click “Install Now,” and jump to 
“Complete installation.”

an alternative boot manager 
GRUB is a perfectly acceptable boot 
manager for most people, but if you’re 
looking for something more visually 
appealing (or you’ve installed Elementary 
on a Mac), then you should look to replace 
it with the rEFInd Boot Manager. Note that 
rEFInd only works on computers that use 
a UEFI rather than a BIOS—this should 
cover most modern PCs (and Macs from 
2006 onward).
Once Elementary has been installed, 
open the Terminal, and enter the following 
commands to install rEFInd (you should 
skip the first command if you’ve previously 
installed software-properties-common):
 $ sudo apt-get install software- 
 properties-common && sudo  
 apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-add-repository  
 ppa:rodsmith/refind
 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo  
 apt-get install refind
Once installed, answer “Yes” at the 
screen that appears, then wait for rEFInd 
to finish installing itself. Reboot your

replaced with a friendlier, more visually 
appealing alternative—use the mouse or 
keyboard to move between options, and 
note that rEFInd automatically selects the 
last-used operating system as the default 
choice the next time you reboot your PC.
You can also install rEFInd without 
adding the repository: Open the Epiphany 
web browser from the Dock, and go to 
www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html, 
where you should click the “binary zip file” 
link to save the refind-bin-0.10.5.zip file.
Once complete, click the file to open the 
“Downloads” folder. Right-click the zip file, 
and choose “Extract Here.” Open the newly 
created “refind-bin” folder, then right-click 
inside the “Files” window, and choose 
“Open With > Terminal.” Finally, type the 
following command:
 $ ./refind-install
Enter your account password when 
prompted, and a series of messages 
should appear confirming that rEFInd is 
the default boot manager.

followed by “Continue.”
When the space has been freed up, 
select the “free space,” and click the “+”

4096MB, to create a 4GB swap file (ample 
for most setups), select “End of this space,” 
click the “Use as” drop-down, and set to

choosing whether to log in automatically. 
Click “Continue,” and leave Elementary to

to disconnect your Elementary install drive 
or eject the disc, then press [Enter].
Your PC reboots, and you see the new

leave “Elementary” selected, and hit Enter, 
or wait for it to start loading on its own.
Once you reach the login screen, things 
will start to feel familiar—Elementary may be 
based on Linux, but its point-and-click desktop 
is much closer to Windows (or macOS).

The 
Elementary 
desktop consists of 
three primary areas: 
at the bottom is the 
Dock, with shortcuts 
to various apps, as well as the App Center 
(where you keep Elementary up to date), 
and any icons representing open programs.
You should see the App Center icon show 
a number, which indicates there are updates 
available. Click it to open the App Center, 
switch to the “Updates” tab, and you’ll find 
various updates—including crucial OS 
updates—are waiting for you. Click “Update 
All,” and enter your user password when 
prompted to provide elevated access. 
You’ll see progress bars appear as updates 
are downloaded and installed—as you’re 
installing OS updates, you may be prompted 
to reboot when the process is complete.
While you wait, familiarize yourself with 
the other key areas of the desktop. The 
“Applications” shortcut, top-left, reveals a 
pop-up menu giving you access to all your 
apps, which can be viewed alphabetically 
or by category, while a Search tool helps 
you target specific apps, settings, and even 
actions within apps (such as options for 
taking screenshots, for example). Open an

dual-boot

install on mac 
One of Elementary OS’s biggest selling 
points is to Mac users fed up with OS X 
(or running an older Mac that’s no longer 
supported). The good news is that with 
a little tweaking, you can easily adapt 
our instructions to install Elementary 
alongside OS X.
You need a Mac running OS X 10.6.8 
or later, with a dual-core processor, and 
2GB of RAM. You must also install the 
rEFInd boot manager before you begin the 
process, to allow your Mac to boot from the 
Elementary install media.
This is straightforward enough, but 
if you’re currently running OS X 10.11 (El 
Capitan) or later, you need to temporarily 
disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)—
reboot your Mac holding Cmd-R 
until the Apple logo appears. 
When the recovery environment 
starts, choose “Utilities > 
Terminal.” Type “csrutil 
disable” and hit Enter, then 
restart your Mac. 
Now download the binary 
zip file from the link in the 
“Alternative boot manager” 
box—it should automatically 
extract its contents—
and open Terminal via 
“Applications > Utilities.” 
Drag the “refind-install” 
script file from inside the 
“Downloads” folder into 
the Terminal window, hit 
Enter, and provide your 
administrator password. 
When “Installation 
has completed 
successfully” appears, 
reboot your Mac, and 
rEFInd is now installed. 
El Capitan and Sierra users should then 
select “Apple Recovery” from the new 
boot menu to go back to the recovery 
environment to bring SIP back (type 
“csrutil enable” at the command prompt).
You then need to partition your drive 
using Disk Utility, to free up space for your 
Elementary installation, then boot from 
the install media, and install Elementary 
in the same way as outlined in the main 
text, following the “Something else” option 
when prompted (it won’t detect OS X). 
After installation completes, you need 
to reinstall rEFInd in Elementary to 
replace GRUB—see the 
box opposite.
make it a permanent fixture, right-click the 
Dock icon, and choose “Keep in Dock.”
If the Dock is your taskbar, and the 
Applications pop-up your “Start” menu, the 
icons at the top-right represent your taskbar 
notification area. Here you’ll find handy 
shortcuts to network settings, music and 
sound, language settings, and the power 
button (including user-switching settings, 
as with Windows). Other things to note: 
“System Settings” under “Applications” 
is your Control Panel, while the Files app 
enables you to browse your hard drives.
autOMatiC
data 
PartitiON
MOuNtiNg
By default, only your 
Elementary partition 
is 
mounted 
at 
startup—while you 
can manually mount 
your data partition each time you boot, it’s 
better to have it mount automatically. 
Install the Disks utility from the App 
Center. Launch the app, select your drive in 
the left-hand pane, then highlight your data 
partition in the right, and click “Settings” 
beneath it. Choose “Edit mount options” 
from the pop-up menu, and slide the 
“Automatic Mount Options” switch to off. 
Leave “Mount at startup” and “Show in user 
interface” checked, then change the “Mount 
Point” to match the drive’s current mount 
point (listed under “Contents” in the main 
“Disks” window). Click “OK,” supply your 
password, and click “OK” again. When you 
next reboot into Elementary, you should find 
the data partition is already mounted.

dEtaiLS
You’re ready to be let 
loose with Elementary, 
but there are some 
things to note: If you 
don’t like the default 
Files manager (it’s a bit simple), try 
searching for “nautilus” to install Ubuntu’s 
more powerful substitute (confusingly also 
called Files). Another alternative to consider 
is Synaptic Package Manager in place of 
App Center for a wider range of apps (and 
easier management of repositories).
Finally, 
install 
Elementary 
Tweaks 
(you need to install software-common-
properties—see the “Terminal” box):
 $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:philip. 
 scott/elementary-tweaks
 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get  
 install elementary-tweaks
Once installed, access it via “System 
Settings” under “Personal”—click “Tweaks” 
to uncover more tweakable settings.

Oh, Windows 10, you’re good. You may 
be helping yourself to my personal 
data, but the promise of a free upgrade 
to the latest OS was too tempting 
to resist. I jumped ship, leaving 
the sunny confines of my safe and 
secure Windows 7 license in favor of 
Windows 10. At least, I did at home. I 
remember it well: I’d just joined the 
Maximum PC team, a young, unsullied 
graduate, ready to start my working 
adventures in an environment I was 
passionate about. I had a Windows 10 
PC at home, and a brand new system 
to build in the office.
But what should I use in the office? 
Well, the promise of a free version of 
Windows 10’s technical preview was 
too enticing to ignore. All you had 
to do was join the Insider Program, 
run the latest tech preview, and you 
were good to go. Soon after, though, 
Microsoft launched its latest OS, and 
this generosity was revoked.
For around six months, I put up with 
the “Activate Windows” watermark, 
until I tried enabling the Insider 
Preview Builds once more, with the 
Fast level selected. The watermark 
having temporarily disappeared for 
some reason, I assumed my version 
was activated. It wasn’t. And I didn’t 
discover that until after I’d written 
the $300 Build It challenge. So today, 
long past Win 10’s free upgrade path, 
you can no longer get a copy for free. I 
stand corrected. And annoyed.

BACKGROUND
Apple has announced a trio of new laptops, and today we’re 
looking at the top of the line, with its new Touch Bar, which 
attempts to replace our tried-and-true function keys. It’s time 
to tear down the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar! 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  15.4-inch LED-backlit Retina Display with 2880x1800 
resolution (220dpi), P3 color gamut
•  2.6GHz Skylake quad-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo Boost up to 
3.5GHz), with integrated Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB of GDDR5
•  16GB of 2,133MHz LPDDR3 onboard memory
•  256GB PCIe-based onboard SSD (configurable to 512GB, 
1TB, or 2TB SSD)
•  Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports supporting charging, 
DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, USB 3.1 Gen 2
•  Touch Bar with integrated Touch ID sensor
•  Force Touch trackpad
KEY FINDINGS
•  On initial inspection, the 15-inch MBP looks like a scaled-up 
version of the 13-inch model. We do notice a difference in the 
battery layout, but overall it’s like looking at twins. And look 
what we ran into! A connector to nowhere. Apple may have 
included this to access the soldered-in SSD for data 
recovery. We’d rather see a removable/upgradeable SSD, 
particularly in a machine targeted at pros—but this way, if 
your logic board bites the dust, there might at least be a 
chance of recovering your data with Apple’s help. 
•  Anxious to get a peek at Apple’s re-engineered thermal 
architecture, we free the fans from the four T3 screws 
securing them to the rear case. And they come out 
hassle-free. No glue on this puppy! On the outside, that is. 
Opening up the fan takes some seriously aggressive prying 
against clips and adhesive.
•  This 15-inch MacBook Pro has a similar speaker grille to its 
smaller 13-inch counterpart. Most of the grille doesn’t 
include full through-holes, prompting us to question, why the 
dimples, Apple? Survey says: weight-savers, so it goes faster 
when you put wheels on it. 
•  After accidentally separating the digitizer from the OLED 
panel, we turn our tools to the LED display. Two teardown 
engineers, an opening pick, X-Acto knife, isopropyl alcohol, a 
heat gun, and an iOpener all came to this OLED teardown 
party, but Apple’s adhesive was still too much for our glue 
separation squad. Thwarted by the monstrous amount of 
adhesive holding the OLED panel in place, we resign 
ourselves to flecking away shards of glass. 
•  Repairability Score: 1 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). The 
trackpad is easy to access and straightforward to replace. 
Use of proprietary pentalobe screws makes servicing and 
repair unnecessarily difficult. The entire battery assembly is 
strongly glued into the case, complicating replacement. The 
processor, RAM, and flash memory are soldered to the logic 
board. The Touch Bar adds a second, difficult-to-replace 
screen to damage. The Touch ID sensor doubles as the power 
switch, and is paired with the T1 chip on the logic board. 
Fixing a broken power switch may require help from Apple, 
or a new logic board. 
MacBook Pro 
15” Touch Bar
The world’s 
most superglued 
battery—don’t 
you dare try to 
change it.
The only easy 
part of this  
entire teardown.

DownloaD anD install
There’s a lot to get sorted on your Raspberry Pi before you can 
begin thinking—and, since it’s relatively short on processing 
power, you’ll have to wait a while for everything to install and 
compile. Begin with a fresh install of Raspbian, if you can, and open 
up the terminal app by clicking the appropriate icon at the top of 
the desktop. First, type  git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.
git ~/torch --recursive  to pull the files required for Torch from 
GitHub, and place them in your home folder, then type  cd ~/torch; 
bash install-deps;  to furnish your Raspberry Pi with everything 
Torch needs to run. This takes a while, but not quite as long as the 
final install process [image a], which is done by typing  ./install.
sh . Now enter  source ~/.bashrc  to add the path to Torch to your 
environment variables, then install the extra Lua components that 
Char-rnn requires using  luarocks install nngraph ,  luarocks  
 install optim , and  luarocks install nn . Finally, let’s pull down 
the Char-rnn package from GitHub using  git clone https://github.
com/karpathy/char-rnn.git .
2
set up your pi
We’re not quite ready to go. It’s important to give Char-rnn 
the largest resources possible to do its task; it’s very easy, 
if you’re working with a lot of data, to exhaust the Pi’s rather feeble 
At leAst until they power the inevitable robot uprising that will one day enslave the citizens of 
Earth, recurrent neural networks are great fun to play with. They generally consist of deceptively 
simple code—in this case, a package called Char-rnn, supplied by Stanford Computer Science PhD 
student and neural network expert Andrej Karpathy, which is a slightly expanded version of his 100-
line original, coded in Lua for the Torch deep learning framework. 
In base terms, you feed Char-rnn a source document containing the sort of thing you’d like it to 
learn to create—we’ll show you a couple of examples of this—and set it to grind away. As it does 
so, it analyzes the original, firing neurons in a virtual brain as it begins to recognize patterns and 
structures, learning what you find desirable based on that input. Because this is a “recurrent” 
neural net, it is influenced not only by that single input, but by the history of everything it’s 
learned in the past, and when you later ask it for a sample, it calls upon its learning experience to 
generate results. Andrej Karpathy’s extensive blog post (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-
effectiveness) explains much more. –Alex Cox

1GB of RAM, particularly as that’s shared between the 
GPU and video output. To fix this, run  sudo raspi-config  
[image b] in a terminal window. Let’s do away with the 
Raspbian GUI on the next boot (option 3, B1, B2 to jump 
directly to a logged-in command line), and allocate as 
much RAM to system memory as we can (option 7, A3, and 
set the GPU memory value to 16MB). Reboot your Pi (type  
 sudo reboot  into the command line to do this quickly) and 
we’re now ready to run.
3
start thinking
You can set Char-rnn thinking with the default 
options, working on the included Tiny Shakespeare 
dataset, by typing  th train.lua -gpuid -1 , which tells 
Torch (th) to run the training file (train.lua), without using 
GPU processing (“-1” being the gpu id of “no GPU”). But it 
won’t work. After about 100 iterations through the code, it 
crashes with a segmentation fault, because the Raspberry 
Pi’s RAM is completely exhausted. We have to be more 
conservative; append  -batch_size 25  to the command 
to force Char-rnn to work with smaller portions of the 
original data. This, however, still isn’t brilliant, because 
the process will take a good 21 hours to complete, so also 
append  -max_epochs 5  and -num_layers 1  to scale 
things back even further.

what’s happening?
As Char-rnn thinks, it prints its output [image C], and you 
can watch its intelligence increase with every step. Keep 
an eye on the “train_loss” value, which will likely start at around 
4, and work its way toward 0 as the network processes. Every so 
often, by default every 1,000 steps, it saves a log of its training data 
in the “/cv” folder, meaning you can later go back and check them 
out, and it also saves one when its allocated processing workload 
is complete—in our case, after five epochs, or complete passes 
over the original training data. If you ever want to stop the process 
before it’s fully complete, just hit Ctrl-C.
5
test output
As long as you have at least one checkpoint saved in the  
“/cv” directory (type  ls ~/torch/char-rnn/cv  to see its 
contents), you can sample some output from it, bearing in mind 
that earlier checkpoints will be significantly more stupid than later 
ones. Just type  th sample.lua -gpuid -1 cv/<name of checkpoint>  
to display some output on screen [image D], or append  > output.txt  
to pipe that output to a text file. 
6
Different Data
Of course, you’re not restricted to the original dataset. You 
could process just about anything through your neural net, 
as long as you can put it in a plaintext file—Char-rnn looks for a 
file called “input.txt” in a folder underneath the “/data” directory. 
Let’s give it a try with a set of the 20,000 most popular American 
D
English words, based on Google’s enormous language 
training corpus. First, you need to head to the correct 
place ( cd ~/torch/char-rnn/data ), then create a new 
folder (mkdir words ), and head into it with  cd words . 
Use  git clone https://github.com/first20hours/google-
10000-english.git  to download a set of words, then use  
mv /google-10000-english/20k.txt ./input.txt  to move 
the appropriate file and rename it. You can now get Char-
rnn pondering this new dataset by adding  -data_dir data/
words  to our original training command. It drops its 
checkpoints into the same “/cv” directory as the other 
training data, so append  -savefile words  to change the 
filename, and make its checkpoints easily identifiable. The 
results [image e] can be quite amusing. 
E
C
OK, we’ll admit it: Recurrent neural networks are not 
necessarily best suited to the low-powered environment 
of the Raspberry Pi, because they demand a fairly heavy 
computational overhead. This is particularly true if you 
want your processing to complete quickly. If you have heftier 
hardware around, it’s more than possible to run Torch and 
Char-rnn elsewhere, and even take advantage of your GPU 
for a burst of extra processing speed using CUDA, or OpenCL 
on AMD cards. Annoyingly, we can’t see a way to use Torch 
on non-Linux environments, so you’ll need to fire up Ubuntu 
or similar, get your graphics card drivers sorted out, and, in 
addition to the modules we installed in the main guide, run 
(for CUDA)  luarocks install cutorch  and  luarocks install  
 cunn , or (for OpenCL) 
run  
luarocks 
install  
 cltorch  and  luarocks  
 install clnn . Then, when 
activating 
the 
training 
script, omit the “-gpuid 
-1” argument to use the 
default GPU, and add 
“-opencl 1” if you’re on 
AMD hardware. Now feel 
free to add extra layers of 
processing with “-num_
layers” and increase your 
batch size as you see fit.

you choose, open the image in Photoshop and, for the first of our 
color isolation methods, head to the “Select” menu, and choose 
“Color Range” [Image a].

seleCt Colors 
In the window that opens, you have the choice of being able 
to select colors in a range—reds, say—or by sampling an 
area with the eyedropper, which functions more or less identically 
to the main Eyedropper tool in Photoshop. By sampling the yellow 
cab with the dropper, it appears white in the small preview. You can 
expand this to the main image by choosing “Grayscale” from the 
“Selection Preview” drop-down, which makes for a very odd image, 
but lets you see exactly what you’re selecting. Once you’re happy 
with what you’ve sampled, click “OK,” and the familiar marching 
ants of the Photoshop selection now wall off those pixels. You’ll 
almost certainly select some additional colors that you don’t want 
by using this method, so use the Quick Selection tool in conjunction 
with Shift and Alt to add and remove selected areas.

An interlude: Speaking of color selection and eyedroppers, 
here’s something that blew our collective mind when we 
There’s a phoTographic effecT you may have seen if you’re friends with any parents on 
Facebook. An image is drained of color, apart from specific hues, which are injected back into the 
otherwise monochrome image.
It’s a bit overused—and, if we’re being honest, groan-inducing, especially when applied to photos 
of newborn babies—but by recreating it, we can gain some insights into how Photoshop works, 
because it’s possible to do it in a couple different ways, depending on whether you choose to work 
on the colors involved specifically, by selecting them directly, or just the area you want to work on 
more generally, by selecting the pixels in a certain area, no matter what color they are.
It’s a relatively simple effect, albeit a striking one, so is something you could achieve in image-
editing apps other than Photoshop. And if you can use it to make a new mom smile, then we’ve all 
made the world a better place. –Ian EvEndEn

found out about it. The Eyedropper tool isn’t confined to 
Photoshop. It works across your whole monitor, so if you 
want to sample a color from a web page, you can, just 
by having the page open, and dragging the tool across 
from Photoshop. Your color selection must start within 
Photoshop, but once you’re sampling, you can drag the 
dropper anywhere on your screen, release, and have the 
color information sampled to Photoshop. Neat, huh?

deColorIze the baCkground 
Back to business. Now you want to remove the color 
from the rest of the image, so invert your selection 
(“Select > Inverse”), and head to the Layers palette. At 
the bottom, there’s an icon that looks like a circle divided 
in half. Part black, part white. Click it, and a menu pops 
up with all the different Adjustment Layers you can add. 
Choose “Black White,” and you should instantly get your 
desired effect. There are still plenty of options to mess 
around with, though, including some presets (we’ve used 
High Contrast Blue [Image b]) and sliders to manually 
adjust the effect. If the color that remains isn’t as bright as 
you’d like, bring back the selection (“Select > Reselect,” 
then “Select > Inverse”), before using the Hue/Saturation 
Window (“Image > Adjustments > Hue/Saturation”) to 
bring out the color more strongly.

step baCk In hIstory 
The second way of achieving the same effect uses 
Photoshop’s History Brush and the History palette’s 
Snapshot ability. Reopen your original image file, and open History 
(“Window > History”). At the top of the palette, you’ll find an 
automatically generated Snapshot, probably labeled with the image 
file name. You can create more at any time using the camera icon 
at the bottom of the History palette. This is a record of the image at 
the moment the Snapshot was created. They don’t save with your 
image file, unfortunately, so be sure not to close and reopen your 
file while doing this. 
6 
use the snapshot 
Your image is probably in RGB color at the moment, so we’re 
going to remove the color information by going to “Image > 
Mode > Grayscale,” and clicking “Discard.” Then, we’re going to put 
it back into a color mode by going to “Image > Mode > RGB Color.” 
Note that your image stays black and white—the color information 
that has been discarded is gone forever. But not quite: There’s a 
Snapshot at the top of the History palette that still remembers the 
colors. We can bring them back by using the History Brush. Make 
sure the box to the left of the Snapshot is selected in the History 
palette, then use the History Brush tool (Y) to paint over the areas 
C
to which you want to bring the color back. We’ve painted 
very sloppily around the taxis to show the effect [Image C]. 
7 
Careful ColorIng 
You need to be quite accurate here, because you 
really only want the taxis to be in color, and not 
passers-by or the road surface, which has a blue tint. 
Be patient. Whatever the object you’re re-coloring, you 
don’t want that color bleeding into the background or 
other nearby objects. Use a tiny brush and zoom right 
in if necessary. To make things easier, you may like to 
select the area you want to color, as while there’s an 
active selection, you can’t paint outside of it. Feather the  
edges by a few pixels for a smooth transition using “Select 
> Modify > Feather.”
8 
fInal tweaks 
You can paint the History Brush state on to a new 
layer if needed, so the effect can be blended back 
into the original. To do this, make a new layer, and ensure 
it’s selected before you begin painting. Save as a PSD to 
preserve your layers, and export as a JPEG for sharing or 
printing [Image d]. 
D
The History palette was one 
of the most useful additions to 
Photoshop back in version 5—
it’s essentially one long undo 
tool. It lists every action you 
have performed, and allows 
you to step back through them 
just by clicking. You can change 
how many steps it remembers 
in the “Performance” section 
of “Preferences.” It’s 50 by 
default, 
which 
should 
be 
plenty for most purposes. 
Snapshots 
are 
useful 
for 
preserving states that would 
be lost from the palette as 
you create more entries in it. 
We’ve used a Snapshot here, 
but you can use any state on 
the palette as a source for the 
History Brush by checking the 
box to its left.

Become a Metadata 
Master with Mp3tag
1 
The basics
Open Mp3tag, and select “File > Change Directory” to choose 
a directory containing a single album of tracks. Once located, 
click “Select Folder.” A list of files appears, complete with any 
current tags. Select one item and you can manually edit its tags, 
plus add or change artwork by dragging an image file from a File 
Explorer window into the artwork box. You can also edit multiple 
files at the same time by Ctrl-clicking them [image a]. Be sure to 
click the “Save” button when you’re done to update the tags.
2 
Quick-fire Tips
Made a mistake? Use the buttons or “Edit” menu to undo 
recently saved changes or remove tags entirely. When 
editing multiple items, you’ll see options such as “<keep>” which 
instructs Mp3tag to leave that tag alone (it’s set by default for 
certain tags, such as Title). 
>> Need to rename your original files to match the new tags? Open 
the “Convert” menu [image b], where you can quickly apply your 
choice of tags to the file name (or vice versa). Tweak the “Format 
string:” box to include the information you wish—click “>” to quickly 
insert other elements, such as album or artist.
Music files need to be tagged—without the correct metadata in place, how do you know the 
track you’ve selected is the right one? If you use Windows Media Player to rip your CDs, you’ll find 
its relatively small database often produces incorrect matches (and beyond that, no matches at 
all). You could spend hours manually entering this information in Windows Media Player’s arcane 
interface, or you could employ the services of a tool that makes managing music (and music video) 
files much simpler.
The tool in question is Mp3tag, which can be installed as a regular application or run as a 
portable tool. Point it toward a directory of media files, and you can review existing tags, update 
tags for individual tracks or entire albums, and—crucially—tap into various online databases to find 
the correct tags (and artwork) to apply to your tracks. 
Mp3tag supports a wide range of formats and tag standards, spanning everything from MP3, 
WMA, AAC, and MP4 to FLAC, APE, OGG, and WAV. It’s easy to use, so we’ll rush through the basics, 
then focus on its more advanced features. One thing’s for certain: If you’ve been struggling to keep 
your music collection properly tagged, you’re about to experience nirvana. –nick peers

this to filter by keyword or make use of filter expressions 
(see “Help > Contents > Filters”) to create sophisticated

Filling in tags by hand is, frankly, excruciating, 
which is where the “Tag Sources” menu comes into 
play. Select your tracks, then open “Tag Sources.” You’ll 
see several popular online databases, including Freedb, 
MusicBrainz, Amazon, and—our personal favorite—
Discogs. The first time you use one you may have to log into 
your online account to authorize Mp3tag—just follow the 
prompts. Once done, you’re prompted to search by album 
title (which may already be pre-filled, if the album tag 
exists). Amend this if necessary, then click “Next.”

follow The wizard
If you get an authorization error for Discogs, remove any 
punctuation from the album title, and click “Next” to try 
again. A list of matching results appears. Select the correct one 
and click “Next.” You’ll see a screen providing you with album 
information and a list of tracks. You need to drag and drop your 
tracks in the right-hand pane to match them up correctly (or use 
the “Move up” and “Move down” buttons). If you’re only matching 
a few tracks, place the “<no association>” entries next to tracks 
you don’t want to match. Click “OK” when you’re done. The tags are 
applied to your tracks.
6 
add More daTabase opTions
You can download user-written scripts to add more options 
to the “Tag Sources” menu. For example, the Discogs search 
tool only works with album titles, which doesn’t always produce the 
correct result with generic matches (such as “Greatest Hits”). The 
box, below-right, reveals an example using Discogs, but if you’re 
a MusicBrainz fan, locate the MusicBrainz XML Webservice post. 
Save either zip file to your hard drive, then extract the .src files 
inside to the %appdata%\Mp3tag\data\sources folder. The new 
options can be found under “Tag Sources > MusicBrainz v2.” 
7 
Make use of acTions
Actions enable you to quickly perform corrections and edits 
across a range of tracks. For example, if you accidentally 
leave Caps Lock on while entering tag information, simply select 
your tracks and choose “Actions > Case Conversion” to apply 
capitalization to the first letter of each word [image c]. Select 
“Actions > Actions” to set up your own or edit an existing action. 
Actions are organized into groups—this enables you to process 
C
D
multiple actions with a single click. You can append new 
actions on to existing actions by selecting the group name, 
then clicking the “Edit” button followed by “New.”
8 
add a new acTion
Alternatively, create a new action group from 
scratch: choose “Actions > Actions (quick)” to 
create a new action and apply it to a new group. This is a 
wizard-based approach [image d]. First select the action 
type—there are 15 templates to choose from—and then 
select requirements (such as matching text or a regular 
expression), and the action to perform. To find out how 
each one works, select “Help > Contents,” and click 
“Actions” in the navigation pane for a comprehensive guide 
to each template.
9 
back up your changes
After a while, you’ll build a handy library of third-
party or custom-built scripts and actions, as well 
as tweaking Mp3tag to your personal needs. Protect this 
by periodically backing up your user configuration—select 
“File > Save Configuration,” and save the zip file to a safe 
location. When you want to restore it, simply unzip the file’s 
contents to %appdata%\Mp3tag (or the location of your 
Mp3tag folder, if you’re running it as a portable app). 
You’ll find lots of scripts on 
the Mp3tag forum. Browse to

Use Photoshop 
Plugins with GIMP
1
PrePare GIMP to receIve PluGIns
First, download and install GIMP from www.gimp.org; it’s 
available as either a direct download or a torrent, and there 
are versions for all operating systems. Once that’s done, install the 
GIMP Photoshop Plugin (PSPI) from graphics software developer 
Akvis (http://bit.ly/2nCezxm), and extract the contents of the 
zip archive to C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins 
(assuming you used the default install path for GIMP). You only need 
the exe file, not the “PSPI” folder.
>> You’ll see that there are already lots of plugins in this folder 
[Image a]. These are tools that have been judged useful and stable 
enough to be pre-installed. To check that the new plugin has 
installed correctly, open GIMP, then click “Filters,” and you should 
see a menu item at the bottom called “Photoshop Plug-in Settings.” 
Once you’re satisfied, close GIMP.
2
FInd a suItable PluGIn
Now you need a Photoshop plugin to experiment with. The 
Plugin Site (www.thepluginsite.com/resources/freeps.htm) 
is a good place to find free examples. You should be able to use 
most plugins successfully with PSPI, but occasionally you might 
encounter one that causes the photo editor to crash. If you want to 
try using a premium plugin, make sure you experiment with a free 
trial before you commit to buying it. Only install one new Photoshop 
Adobe PhotoshoP is the world’s industry stAndArd Photo editor. It’s hugely powerful, 
and is expandable through third-party plugins that add even more features to its already 
impressive toolkit. It’s not cheap, though, with an annual subscription costing $120. Justifiable for 
professionals, but perhaps not so much for hobbyists.
That’s where the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) comes in. This open-source photo 
editor has been in development since 1995, and over the years it has grown into the closest free 
alternative to Adobe’s premium software. It includes manual and automatic tools for refining color, 
saturation, and contrast; one-click smart filters and effects; fully customizable brushes and text 
tools; and even support for plugins.
There are lots of extensions created specifically for GIMP, but with a little tweaking, you can use 
great-looking Photoshop plugins, too. Before we get started, bear in mind that this technique works 
with plugins in 8BF, 8BA, 8BI, and 8LY format, but not with Photoshop Actions (ATN files). That’s 
because Actions are essentially macros that perform a series of operations automatically using 
Photoshop’s own tools, whereas plugins are more like small programs in their own right. –Cat Ellis

plugin at a time, so you can easily determine whether one 
is making the program unstable.
>> Here we’re using a free trial of Akvis’s own premium 
Charcoal plugin [Image b], which simulates the look of 
traditional media with customizable detail levels and 
paper types, plus some rather cheesy frame options. The 
plugin should have its own installer, so run this, and save 
it to a convenient place, such as a folder called “Plugins” 
on your desktop. If you’re given a choice of “Standalone” or 
“Plugin” options during the installation, choose the latter.
3
create reFerence nodes
Now you need to tell PSPI where to look for 
Photoshop plugins. Start GIMP, then navigate to 
“Filters > Photoshop Plug-in Settings,” and click the white 
page icon to create a new reference node, which provides 
the path for PSPI to follow. Click the folder icon on the 
right, and drill down to the location where you saved the 
plugin. The red button on the “Photoshop Plugin” window 
turns green. Click “OK,” then close GIMP.
>> When you restart the photo editor, it looks for plugins 
in the folder you selected. Open a picture to experiment 
on, then click “Filters,” and look for a new subdirectory—
in this case, it’s called “AKVIS.” If everything has gone

according to plan, you can use the newly installed plugin just as you 
would in Photoshop [Image c]. 
>> If you want to add more than one plugin, it’s best to create 
multiple folders within the main “Plugins” directory on your 
desktop. You can then create new reference nodes for each plugin, 
and easily deactivate any that cause GIMP to become unstable. If 
a node’s indicator button turns red, it means the path is broken—
probably because a directory has been deleted or renamed—and 
any plugins found there will no longer work.
4
other Photo edItors
If you find GIMP’s interface awkward to work with, there 
are several other photo editors that work with Photoshop 
plugins. Some of these, such as Corel Paint Shop Pro, are premium 
software, but are much more affordable than Adobe’s app, and 
potentially a better choice for amateur photographers. These 
programs usually have a built-in tool for importing and accessing 
Photoshop plugins, so there’s no need for additional tools.
>> There are also a few other free editors that are compatible with 
Photoshop plugins, but are less complex than GIMP, due to being

developed by a smaller team of contributors. One of these 
is Irfanview—a free photo viewer and organizer that does 
double-duty as a basic editor.
5
use PhotoshoP PluGIns In IrFanvIew
If your Photoshop plugin is an 8BF file, it should 
work with Irfanview. To try it, download Irfanview as 
a self-extracting exe file from www.irfanview.com/64bit.
htm, and run the installer. Once it’s finished, download and 
install Irfanview Plugins from the same location. 
>> Launch Irfanview, and open a photo to edit. You can 
open one picture, then browse through the others in the 
same folder using your mouse wheel. Tap Ctrl-K to access 
the “Adobe 8BF Filters” dialog, and click “Add 8BF Filters 
(Files).” Navigate to your downloaded plugin, and click 
“Open.” You can add several plugins this way, and add 
comment lines to organize them into groups. Click “Start 
selected filter” to run it as normal. The plugin effect is 
applied to the whole image once you close the “Adobe 8BF 
Filters” window [Image d]. 
There are several different types of Photoshop plugins (not 
including Actions, which are actually macros). Each one works like 
a mini program, providing extra tools within the host photo editor. 
8BF plugins are filter effects, and are the ones you’ll be most likely 
to use, but there are also 8BA (import, or acquisition plugins), 8BE 
(export plugins), and 8LY (automation plugins). There are also 
selection plugins in the formats 8BS and 8BY, but none that have 
been created by third parties.
Generally speaking, the older a plugin is, the more likely it is 
to work seamlessly with GIMP and other applications. Adobe 
tightened regulations on developers when it released Photoshop 7, 
restricting access to the software developer kit (SDK)—including 
specifications for plugins—and making developer licenses more 
restrictive. This meant developers often had to choose between 
ensuring compatibility with other programs and making best use 
of new features exclusive to Photoshop to give better results.

Play PC Games 
on Your Smartphone
1
Get the server
Remotr works on a client/server model, which means you first 
need to install its server app on your gaming PC. Head to http://
remotrapp.com, scroll down until you find the relevant option 
[Image A], and download the Windows Streamer app. Run it to 
install Remotr, open up the app, and click the “New Account” button 
to set up an account. You may wish to sign up with a burner email 
account from the likes of http://guerrillamail.com for a couple of 
reasons: Perhaps you’re concerned about getting too much mail 
from Remotr or its friends (given that there’s no option to refuse it), 
and, if you want to play multiplayer games, everyone’s going to need 
to sign in with the same details.
2
Add A GAme
Remotr’s initial lineup may be a little sparse. It attempts 
to find games it knows on your hard drive and add them to 
its interface, and you’ll also see a big ad for the affiliated Vortex 
streaming service, which offers cloud-hosted gaming PCs for a fee. 
If the game you want to play isn’t listed, click “Add Game” in the 
bottom-left corner, and dig through your hard drive [Image B] to 
find its executable. Steam games are generally added to the grid 
automatically, but if they’re not, they’re usually found in “Program 
Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common.” Clicking games in this 
interface doesn’t do anything, but their presence means they’re 
available to any client apps.
We’re not short of options when it comes to streaming games. We’ve talked plenty in these 
pages about the immensely useful Steam In-Home Streaming, we’ve covered the likes of GameShow 
and XSplit, which send your games up to Twitch and other online streaming services, and we’ve 
even looked at ways you can beam console games through your network and play them on your 
PC. Well, add Remotr to the list. It’s immensely flexible, offering up client apps for smartphones, 
tablets, and other Windows PCs, happily streaming over cell phone networks if you have the data 
allocation for it, and it’s incredibly simple to set up and use.
Let’s preface this a little, though, with a couple of caveats. Point one: Don’t expect ultra 
performance or lag-free gaming. Remotr’s solution is quick and very well coded, but it’s not 
going to be suitable for the twitchiest games, particularly if you’re streaming outside of your local 
network. It also scales down the quality of streaming (though not the quality of the source game) to 
meet your network specifications, so if you’re obsessed with uncompressed graphical fidelity, you 
might be best staying at your home PC. –Alex Cox

There are two varieties of client available: mobile 
and desktop. The desktop client is relatively easy, in 
that you simply need to download and install it, log in with 
the details we set earlier, and you should see your server 
active and ready. If you don’t, or if the client doesn’t seem 
to be able to connect, make sure your PC is awake—use 
“Power Options” in the Windows Control Panel to stop it 
sleeping, if need be—and try bringing the server app into 
the foreground. You may need to log into Steam, too.
>> Installing on mobile is just as straightforward. Find 
Remotr in your device’s app store—it’s available for both 
iOS and Android—and get the app installed. Log in, and 
you’ll see your server; tap it, select a game, and (after 
you’ve watched an ad) you should be up and running. If you 
hit any snags, head to your server, and check the graphics 
settings for individual games, to ensure they’re running 
in windowed or borderless full-screen mode. In general, 
proper full-screen mode doesn’t play nicely with any kind of 
streaming or screen capture, and Remotr is no exception.

keyboard, they work on a PC client exactly as they do on your server 
machine. Plug in a gamepad, and that should work perfectly, too. On 
mobile, though, things are a bit different. By default, Remotr uses 
your phone’s screen as a touchpad, translating swipes into mouse 
movement, and taps into left clicks. It may also, in some cases, 
presume you’d like to use a gamepad with your target game, and 
stick an overlay on your screen [Image C]. This can be configured, 
and any additional controls added to the overlay, by tapping 
the Remotr icon in the top-right, and selecting “Edit Controls.” 
Thankfully, given that PC games are rarely built to have massive 
thumbs all over them, you’re also free to use Bluetooth controllers 
or, on Android, wired gamepads with a USB OTG connector. These 
can be configured in the “Settings” section [Image d] .

Better settInGs
The best results, naturally, come with higher network 
bandwidth. It’s possible to stream over Wi-Fi, though results 
are unpredictable, and you may experience some input or sound

lag to go with the degraded picture. Hooking your server 
up to your router via Ethernet is the first step, and using 
a similar wired client is the second, though this obviously 
isn’t possible if you’re blasting games to a mobile device.
>> Check the “Settings” screen of the server app, too, for 
the switch that enables you to activate GPU acceleration. 
This aids the stream encoding by allowing your GPU to chip 
in a little processing time, but obviously strips a few cycles 
away from the game you’re trying to run. When streaming, 
this isn’t a huge problem, although you may need to dial 
back the rendering settings of your games to compensate. 
>> If you’re using a high DPI display, we suggest you 
drop your screen resolution before streaming, for obvious 
reasons. There’s a switch in the “Settings” screen to 
automatically drop the resolution when using mobile 
devices—sending 4K to a 5-inch screen doesn’t make 
a huge amount of sense anyway—but no way to do this 
automatically when streaming to a PC client. 
If you’re looking to send gaming streams to your Raspberry Pi, 
you may be tired, as we are, of waiting for Remotr’s promised Pi 
app. There is a solution, however, in the form of the decidedly less 
user-friendly Parsec (http://parsec.tv). Using UDP (rather than 
TCP/IP) to stream at super-low latency, it enables you to install 
a server on your gaming PC, a client on your Raspberry Pi 3, and 
beam games from one to the other. There’s a slight problem, 
though: In our experiments, we’ve found it a little unstable, and 
somewhat unwilling to work with certain hardware configurations. 
Theoretically, you should be good to stream even on machines with 
Intel embedded graphics—your results may vary.
If you have a decent Nvidia card, there’s another solution:

Secure Logins with 
Google Authenticator
1
Open sesame 
To implement multi-factor authentication, you need the Google 
Authenticator PAM (pluggable authentication module). A PAM 
is a mechanism used to plug different forms of authentication into 
a Linux computer.
>> The Google Authenticator PAM module is available in the 
official Ubuntu software repositories. To install the package on 
Ubuntu, head to the Terminal and type: 
 $ sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator
>> Once the package has been installed, make sure you’re logged 
in as the user you want to protect with the two-factor authentication. 
Now, in the Terminal window, type:
 $ google-authenticator 
>> This initiates the process of creating a secret key for the user 
by asking a bunch of questions. While it’s safe to answer yes to them 
all, it’s a good idea to understand each one before making your final 
choice, as these choices help balance security with ease of use. The 
first question is pretty safe, and you should allow the command to 
update your Google Authenticator file by answering yes. 
>> You’re then asked whether you would like to restrict the 
use of a token, which forces you to wait for 30 seconds between

processors and easy-to-use password-cracking tools,  
locking access to your computer (and all the data it holds) with a password alone simply  
doesn’t cut the mustard anymore. If you’re really concerned about unauthorized access to 
your computer, you should definitely add an additional layer of authentication. One of the 
easiest mechanisms with which to implement such a two-step verification is the Google 
Authenticator service, which issues a time-based authentication token to supplement the existing 
password challenge.
Once you’ve integrated the service with your Ubuntu login, in addition to your user password, 
you’ll be prompted for one of the quickly expiring tokens before being allowed to log in. Google 
Authenticator generates these OTPs (one-time passwords) on your Android device once it’s been 
configured for every user on your Ubuntu machine. –mayank sharma

logins. While it might seem a little inconvenient at first, you 
should agree to this limitation for maximum protection. 
The next question asks for permission to increase the time 
window that tokens can be used for from the default 1:30 
minutes to 4:00 minutes. Although you can answer yes to 
this question to avoid any issues, type “no” for maximum 
security. If you notice any issues later on, rerun the 
command, and increase the expiration time as suggested. 
The fourth and final question asks you to limit the number 
of attempts for entering the authentication code. You 
should definitely enable this option, because it helps 
prevent brute-force login attacks.

When it’s done, Google Authenticator presents you 
with a secret key and several emergency scratch 
codes. Make sure that you note down these emergency 
scratch codes somewhere safe. They’ll help you log in if 
you ever misplace the Android smartphone that generates 
the OTP. Each code can only be used once.
>> The google-authenticator command also generates a 
QR code [image a], which you can scan with your Android 
smartphone. However, because we haven’t installed the 
app on our phone yet, just note down the 16-digit code for 
the time being.
>> Now repeat this process for each user account that 
uses your computer. Ask everyone you share the computer 
with to log in to their account, run google-authenticator, 
and make a note of their respective emergency scratch 
codes, along with the 16-digit code. 
>> After you’ve generated the authentication code for all 
users, it’s time to configure the login process to work with 
Google Authenticator. All you need to do is edit one file to 
add two-step authentication for all login attempts. Again, 
fire up the Terminal, and type:
 $ sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth  
Scroll right down to the end of the file, and add the 
following line: 
 auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
>> Then save the file and exit. Here we’ve asked Ubuntu 
to use the Google Authenticator PAM module for all login 
attempts. The “nullok” bit at the end of the file asks

Ubuntu to allow a user to log in even if they haven’t run the google-
authenticator command to set up two-factor authentication. So, 
let’s assume you have two users—amber and megan—and have set 
up Google Authentication only for amber. Thanks to nullok, while 
amber has to enter the OTP to access the system, megan can log in 
with just her password. 
>> Note, however, that while this is a useful flexibility to have 
while you’re testing Google Authenticator, once everything works 
smoothly, and you have no issues logging in with the two-factor 
authentication, it’s advisable to force all users to log in through 
Google Authenticator—you do this simply by removing the “nullok” 
bit for this command.

Your Ubuntu installation is now all set up for two-factor 
authentication. To receive the OTPs, you now have to install 
the Google Authenticator app from the Google Play Store on your 
Android smartphone. After installing the app, you have to add an 
account for all the users you’ve run the google-authenticator 
command for on your Ubuntu installation [image B]. 
>> To do this, open the app, and from the main window, tap the 
menu button (the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner). 
Here, tap “Set up account,” and then select the “Enter key provided” 
option. Now enter the 16-digit secret key that you noted earlier, 
after you had run through the google-authenticator tool. Give the 
account a name (a good idea is to use the username of the account 
this is for), and tap the “Add” button.
>> You’ve now set up two-factor authentication on your computer. 
The Android app generates a new six-digit code every 30 seconds. 
When you log in to your account or enter a sudo command, Ubuntu 
prompts for your password, and you’re then asked to enter the 
B
authentication code. At this point, enter the digits currently 
on display in the Android app. 
>> Once you’ve logged in successfully, make sure you 
edit the “etc/pam.d/common-auth” file, and remove 
the “nullok” option, to force login through Google 
Authenticator. Also, remember to create an account in the 
Android app for all the users on your Ubuntu installation. 
>> Going through the additional security might seem 
like a hassle, especially when you need to switch to sudo 
to quickly edit a configuration file. But if you’re using 
the computer in a public place, you’ll quickly learn to 
appreciate the benefits of two-factor authentication. 
Instead of local logins, some people prefer to enable two-
factor authentication only for remote SSH logins. For this, 
begin by making sure you’ve generated a code for the user 
you want to log in as a remote user. Next, make sure you use 
Google Authenticator for SSH logins by editing SSH’s PAM 
configuration file with  sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd . Scroll 
down to the bottom, and add the following line to the file: 
 auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
As in the main tutorial, the “nullok” word at the end 
tells PAM that this authentication method is optional. This 
allows users without a Google Authenticator key to still log 
in using their SSH key. Remember that this is just a fail-safe 
to prevent you from being locked out, in case something 
goes wrong with the setup process. However, once you have 
tested it successfully, generate a key for all SSH users, and 
delete “nullok” from the end of this line to make logins via 
OTP mandatory for everyone.
After editing SSH’s PAM file, it’s time to configure 
SSH to support this kind of authentication. Open the SSH 
configuration file with  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config . Look 
for the line that reads “ChallengeResponseAuthentication,” 
and set its value to “yes.” If the line doesn’t exist, add it 
manually. Save and close the file, then restart SSH to reload 
the configuration files with  sudo service ssh restart . 
You’re now prompted for both your password and Google 
Authenticator code whenever you attempt to log in via SSH.

A Gorgeous 
Gaming Rig
RegaRdless of what some think, Maximum 
PC and PC Gamer are two very separate 
entities. We operate entirely independently 
of each other, with both magazine and online 
teams generally dedicated to their individual 
platforms, while we all contribute where and 
when we can across the superstructure, in one 
way or another. This way, we can tailor content 
in the magazine specifically for you, and again in 
a different style online. 
Recently, the IT crew and PC Gamer’s 
advertising department came to us with a 
particularly tasty conundrum. They had just 
signed a deal with Sega to produce a bunch of 
Dawn of War III videos. The only problem was 
that they needed a system for the shoot that 
looked like a “gaming PC.” Of course, being 
the hardware busybodies that we are, and with 
the IT team suggesting it could piece together 
something suitable out of parts dating back to 
2011, we decided to step in and build them a 
system that truly looked the part.
It also gave us a good opportunity to put 
together a system for the mag, get our PR 
contacts some lovely coverage, and generally 
see how far we could push the GTX 1080 Ti in 
a compact system. Win, win all around, then? 
Well, almost. The deadline was in less than a 
day. We needed to have the system up, ready, 
running, with Windows 10 installed, DoW III on 
board, and ready to be shipped to the designated 
shoot location. No biggy—this is Maximum PC. 
Leveraging our epeen and superior build skills 
over PC Gamer is what we do.

the pRettiest of systems 
when speCCing this build, it was less about hitting those 
performance and pricing sweet spots, and more about what 
looked good. We decided to go with a simple, sleek, black and 
white build, with a few old parts showing their faces once again. 
The case is connected to July 2016’s liquid-cooled build. If you 
remember, we asked NZXT to send us two of its fantastic Manta 
cases. Using the interior of the black variant with the exterior 
white panels added real pop, and helped ensure that the white 
coolant wouldn’t be lost. This is the reverse. With a white interior 
and black panels, it works really well as an AIO build, and the 
black cables of the Kraken X52 stand out against the white inside. 
You might also spot some other parts from that feature: 
the Asus Z170i Pro Gaming, with custom black plastidipped 
heatsinks, and the Corsair AX1200i PSU, with its custom sleeved 
white cable kit from CableMod.
That, however, is where the similarities end. Instead of 32GB 
(2x 16GB) of Kingston HyperX DDR4 at 2,666, we decided to go 
with G.Skill’s stunning Trident Z at 3,200. We also made good 
use of NZXT’s latest Kraken X42, to really make the central CPU 
focal point pop—that focal point being a Core i5-6600K (because, 
honestly, GHz is just a number, right Kaby Lake?). And how could 
we forget the world’s most powerful GPU, the power-hungry, 
frame-spitting GTX 1080 Ti, sitting center stage?
the Cooling setup for this system was done quickly 
and on the fly. Ideally, we would have loved to have 
included a Kraken X52 or X62 here (the 240/280mm 
versions), but because the X52 is currently off-site, 
and the X62 is doing service as part of our dedicated 
test bench, the X42 was our next port of call. Its single 
140mm rad should keep the CPU well in check, but it 
does provide some conundrums as to where to mount 
it. In the end, to keep the interior looking clean, we 
anchored it to the front panel, behind this fan filter, with 
the included NZXT stock fan, drawing air through the 
radiator and into the case.
to offset the laCk of internal airflow being drawn in 
via the front of the case, we decided to install two Be 
Quiet! Silent Wings PWM 120mm fans directly into the 
roof, drawing air down into the chassis. Now, thanks 
to the Manta’s expansive roof space, you could actually 
install these on top of the case, but to improve airflow, 
and get some of the moving parts viewable inside the 
system, we opted to have them mounted below instead. 
Another perk of the radiator being a single 140mm in 
the front.

anotheR neat peRk of one of our favorite ITX cases is the 
inclusion of this simple NZXT LED logo. No RGB, no frills, a 
couple of on/off settings, and that’s it—controllable via a button 
located near the rear I/O panel at the back of the case. On top 
of that, you also get to see the mighty Corsair AX1200i modular 
Platinum PSU. It’s a fairly chunky PSU, but the Manta has more 
than enough room for the brute. We grabbed our set of custom 
braided CableMod cables for this system, too, because the 
white matches the build perfectly. However, after seeing some 
of the company’s new cable combs recently, we do wish we’d 
had a set for that build way back when. But more to come of that 
in the next two issues….
anotheR shiny addition to the Manta is the inclusion 
of this rear I/O LED light, ideal for those fumbling around 
in the dark or under desks. Again, controllable thanks to 
a tiny little switch located just above it. The only problem? 
Well, the video team managed to place the system back in 
the box the wrong way round, wedging it and the packaging 
inside its box. And when we last placed it back in the box 
during our photo shoot, having to drop it into place, the 
LED cover for the rear I/O unfortunately got caught on this 
reviewer’s arm, and snapped off.

theRe’s a Reason this isn’t a wide shot of all the cables: 
because it’s nowhere near even close to being tidy. In fact, 
the cable ties used to jerry-rig this system together weren’t 
even cut off until after the video was shot, during our own 
personal photo shoot. That fan controller, though—we can’t 
express enough how useful these things are. Simply plug 
in six or seven fans of your choosing (DC or PWM), run one 
SATA power into it, connect one PWM header directly to 
your motherboard, and you can control them all off a single 
fan profile in PWM mode. Neat.
what, no ssds? OK, once again, this was due to time constraints. 
The original plan was to use two Samsung 850 Evos for the show 
build (admittedly, one was 250 and the other 500GB). However, 
because of how NZXT has positioned the cable cutouts for these 
mounts, there’s only one way to attach the drives, and that would 
mean the Samsung logo would end up being upside down. Less 
than ideal. So, we dropped them entirely, and ran a single OCZ 
Trion 150 960GB instead, hidden behind that PSU cover on the 
bottom. The only criticism, looking back, is that perhaps we 
should have removed the two trays.

which is useful, 
because of how few 
accessible sata ports there 
are for a clean build.
we Could have given this build a funky 
Warhammer 40K name, such as the Emperor’s 
Chosen, or Gabriel Ti-gelous. But that’s not 
our style, and the Classy Conqueror fits the bill 
a hell of a lot better. After all, this is a system 
that any PC enthusiast could be proud of.
Building a rig at such short notice threw up 
a lot of challenges. Usually, we spend an hour 
or two planning each build, requesting the 
parts, then piecing it together however we see 
fit. Having to improvise and make decisions 
on the fly, however, turned out to be far more 
satisfying than we thought. The Kraken X42 
forced us to rethink our cooling strategy: 
Instead of having two intakes in the front, 
two exhausts in the roof, and leaving the rear 
blank, we opted to run three intakes top and 
front, and one exhaust running out the rear. 
We also chose to use a BitFenix Alchemy 
30cm LED white strip along the top, to 
illuminate the interior, pulling light straight 
down on to the GPU, CPU, and memory. It 
looks stellar, glinting off the braided tubes 
connected to the AIO. That said, it was actually 
an older, used adhesive LED strip, and toward 
the end of the build, it repeatedly fell off, even 
with a brand new layer of double-sided tape. 
Solution? Cable-tie it. It’s held in place by 
three cable ties, through the unused 140mm 
fan mounts at the top of the chassis. We also 
only used two screws in each fan, to save time, 
even if it was only seconds in reality.
What about performance? Well, it’s a weird 
one—with Ryzen dropping, and the 1600 and 
1600X coming in at Core i5 prices, it’s hard 
to say that this system actually represents 
respectable processor performance. Single-
core performance is identical to team red’s, 
but multicore is a bloodbath: 606 points 
in Cinebench R15—hardly anything worth 
writing home about. That said, there currently 
aren’t any ITX Ryzen boards worth investing in, 
and the game difference can be staggering in 
some instances. Speaking of games, the GTX 
1080 Ti really does push the limits when it 
comes to our benchmark suite, smashing all 
of the 1080p tests with ease. The lowest, Deus 
Ex—a title notorious for both its poor Nvidia 
optimization and ridiculously aggressive 
antialiasing at x8 MSAA—came in at 29fps. 
Otherwise, it was an easy 60fps sweep across 
the board, with an average of 92 frames per 
second in Rise of the Tomb Raider, and 106 in 
Far Cry Primal.
That said, this rig shines in both high 
refresh 1440p and 4K gaming. We’re not quite 
at 60fps with the AA ramped up just yet, but if 
you drop those AA tendencies down a tad, it’s 
not difficult to hit that 60fps sweet spot.
When all’s said and done, this build was a 
pleasure to produce, and a very proud moment 
for this reviewer, seeing it going out live in the 
Dawn of War III campaign. It looks a treat, and 
would be at home on any enthusiast’s desk. 
Drop down to some more suitable memory, a 
Z270 Strix ITX board, a lower-end PSU, and a 
reference GTX 1070, and you’d be looking at a 
very graceful 1440p gaming machine.

Oh AMD, AMD, AMD. Why do you do this to us? 
You fight, and you riot, and you revolutionize 
the processor industry, then you tease us 
with a brand new graphics card, only for 
it to be little more than a rebadge. Let’s 
cut straight to it: This is not a brand new 
architecture. In fact, there’s very little 
new about the Radeon RX 580 at all. The 
launch of this new GPU came with little 
fanfare, and with good reason: It’s not Vega.
In short, moving from the RX 480 to the 
580 provides nothing more than a slight 
overclock to the base card. Indeed, you 
could achieve the same results by bumping 
up the power target to 110 percent, and 
moving that clock frequency slightly higher. 
So why do it? Good question. In short, we 
can only guess it’s down to improvements 
in the manufacturing process. Rumors 
abound—we know that GlobalFoundries 
(the crew that manufactures AMD’s GPUs 
and CPUs) uses Samsung’s 14nm LPE 
(standing for low power early, this is 
Samsung’s second iteration on its 14nm 
manufacturing process) technology in its 
400 series cards. It’s possible that with the 
RX 500 series, GloFo is using Samsung’s 
(newly announced) 14nm LPU tech instead, 
improving power efficiency and clock 
speeds in the process. Which may explain

the additional 30W TDP included on this 
card, and the slightly higher clocks.
That aside, it’s the nomenclature that 
gets us. Traditionally, with every new series 
of cards, you get one or two rebadges. 
For instance, a 380 becomes a 470, a 
370 becomes a 460, and so on. Dropping 
the price point, and improving power 
efficiency in the process, is great for the 
consumer, because cards with substantial 
performance, coming in at an incredible 
cost, suddenly become more affordable. 
The 580, on the other hand, has missed 
that beat. The RX 480 has migrated across 
to the 580. This would make sense if AMD 
were about to embark upon a new naming 
scheme, or even if it were to launch two 
new flagships with these rebadges, but 
that’s simply not the case. So what’s going 
on? If anything, these two cards should 
have been renamed the 485 and the 475. 
Especially when you include the lack of any 
reference variants.
Right, enough grumbling, how does it 
look from a performance perspective? 
Well, we have to make it clear that our RX 
580 sample was the Sapphire Nitro+ pre-
overclocked version, compared to our 
stock RX 480. Generally speaking, in game 
we saw an increase of around 10 percent 
across our titles at 1080p. Going from 61fps 
in Far Cry Primal to 66fps, 58fps to 67fps 
in The Division, and 34fps to 40fps in Rise 
of the Tomb Raider. Fairly impressive for a 
GPU that is essentially just a rehash. 
Who is this card aimed at? In short, 
anyone who still hasn’t upgraded from 
AMD’s R9 300 series, or the lower end 
of Nvidia’s GTX 900 series. It’s a rehash 
of an already well-manufactured, well-
priced graphics architecture, bringing that 
price-to-performance heritage forward 
into 2017. In fact, price-to-performance-
wise, it’s actually in a bit of a sweet spot. It 
doesn’t quite wipe Nvidia’s GTX 1060 3GB 
off the top of the 1080p hill just yet, but it’s 
close. And with that extra performance? 
It’s damn tempting, to say the least. Couple 
it with a decent FreeSync 1080p monitor, 
and you’ll be on to a winner. 
There’s been no official announcement 
from AMD yet as to when Vega may be 
launching, although rumors abound that 
it could be any time within the next few 
months. In fact, by the time you read 
this, Computex should be over, and those 
rumors will hopefully become fact. Until 
then, you might want to hold off on those 
big GPU splurges. –ZAK STOREY

Is the six-core version of 
Ryzen the mid-range CPU 
you’ve been waiting for?

When AMD pulleD the wraps off its radical 
new Ryzen CPU, it was all about those eight 
awesome cores. Count ’em, Intel. The first 
Ryzen 7 chips blew the market for $300-
plus CPUs wide open. But not everybody 
can unload that kind of money on a 
processor, especially a brand new design 
that also requires a motherboard upgrade. 
Enter the Ryzen 5 1600X. On paper, it 
might just be the ultimate balancing act 
between performance bang and efficient 
deployment of your hard-earned buck.
Try this for a compelling proposition. 
The 1600X packs six cores, and supports 
12 software threads, while a similarly-
priced Intel processor, the Core i5-7600K, 
has four cores and just four threads. And 
as a consequence of being the top six-
core model, it also clocks in at 3.6GHz 
nominal and 4.0GHz turbo. In other words, 
it looks like a very nicely balanced chip. 
Plenty of cores and threads for powerful 
parallelism, plus high clocks to provide 
solid single-threaded performance. And 
all for $249. It’s the mid-range CPU that 
we’ve all been waiting for, right? 
For the most part, that’s an affirmative. 
When it comes to outright multithreaded 
performance, it pops a cap in the head of 
the Intel Core i5. Take Cinebench: The Core 
i5-7600K manages 663 points. The Ryzen 
1600X? A massive 1,223 points, or nearly 
double the Core i5’s capability. As you-
know-who would say, that’s ’uge.
Admittedly, the Core i5 retains some 
dignity in the single-threaded version of

Cinebench, with 179 points compared to 
the 1600X’s 159 points. However, the AMD 
chip looks like the better trade-off at first 
glance. Elsewhere, if the results aren’t 
quite so spectacular, AMD still chalks 
up some decent wins. It crunches high-
quality video encoding at 22fps to the 
i5’s 16fps, and it motors through the Fry 
Render benchmark in just 3 minutes and 
46 seconds—that’s fully two minutes faster 
than the 7600K.
Parallel lines
Put simply, if you want a CPU for content 
creation, or really any workload that 
majors on parallelism, this isn’t even a 
race. The Intel competition is hideously, 
hopelessly outclassed. That’s true even 
taking into account the fact that the Ryzen 
CPU is a little more power-hungry. An 
extra 10 watts at the wall is surely worth it.
Where the Ryzen proposition is a little 
less compelling is in the games arena. 
It looks competitive in our benchmark 
numbers—when it comes to average 
frame rates, the 1600X delivers on that 
4GHz promise. The subjective experience, 
however, tells a slightly different story. 
Total War: Attila is a great case study 
here. Running on the Intel processor, it’s 
super-smooth, whether you’re up in the 
sky, lording it over your troops, or down in 
the thick of the action. But with the Ryzen 
CPU at the same settings and using the 
same video card, there’s noticeable judder 
almost everywhere. It’s not nearly as 
smooth, and the difference is far greater 
than the modest average frame rate gap.
As for the reasons why, there are 
numerous candidates. For starters, we 
used an Nvidia GPU, and there are at least 
indications that the Nvidia driver is poorly 
optimized for the Ryzen architecture. There 
are also question marks surrounding 
Ryzen’s basic architecture, which is 
composed of a pair of quad-core modules. 
Long story short, some latency is involved 
in communicating between the two quad-
core modules, and that can require careful 
management by both OS and application 
to avoid performance penalties. Ryzen is 
brand new, so most software has yet to be 
tweaked to take account of such issues.
Of course, most software runs OK 
without any modifications. It’s just a pity 
that the main class of application that 
seems to be particularly sensitive to 
Ryzen’s architectural nuances just so 
happens to be gaming. On a final note, like 
other Ryzen processors, the 1600X has 
pretty much zero overclocking headroom. 
AMD has these things running pretty 
ragged. An additional 100MHz was the best 
we could achieve. –JereMy lAirD

Corsair has long been a trusted brand in 
the PC building world, known for its quality 
and high-end components and peripherals. 
If you’ve built a PC in the last two decades, 
it’s likely you’ve used at least one Corsair 
product. But, until recently, the company 
hadn’t jumped into offering complete, pre-
built systems in the same way as the likes 
of MSI, Asus, and Gigabyte do. 
With the One, Corsair has clearly 
established itself as a true pre-built system 
manufacturer, setting itself up with a strong 
foundation in this machine. It’s a triumph of 
clean design, excellent performance, and 
small-form-factor engineering. Measuring 
7.9 x 6.9 x 14.9 inches, the One stands only 
a few inches taller than a Mac Pro, but has 
a look that’s more reminiscent of Tron than 
the Mac Pro’s glorified dustbin appearance. 
One of the more impressive features is 
its cooling solution. Both the CPU and GPU 
are cooled by their own individual 240mm 
radiator each. But rather than outfitting 
each of those with their own fans, the 
entire system is cooled by a single 140mm 
maglev fan up top that through convection, 
draws cold air in through the radiators and 
exhausts it out the top. The result is a well-
cooled system with a minimal footprint that 
runs whisper quiet.  
The overall design is impressively 
compact. There’s no doubt that you could 
build and even buy Mini-ITX systems that 
are smaller than this beast, but Corsair 
utilizes every internal square inch of the 
One to full effect. There’s no wasted space, 
System integrator Corsair. Wait—what?

Two-year parts and labor
and no add-ons just for the sake of having 
frills. The One takes the best that Corsair 
has to offer, and distills things down into a 
very svelte machine. And did we mention 
it’s powerful?
Package of Power
Packed inside is an Intel Core i7 processor, 
an Nvidia 10-series GPU, as well as plenty 
of storage, varying by tier—the One starts 
at $1,800 for an i7-7700, GTX 1070, 240GB 
SSD and 1TB HDD, and goes up from there. 
The “Pro” unit we tested featured an i7-
7700K, GTX 1080, and 960GB SSD, for a 
retail price of $2,300.
The Corsair One punches out some 
serious performance, too, hot on the heels 
of much larger, beefier systems. Gaming 
performance fell short of setups with dual-
GPU loadouts, but the One’s single GTX 
1080 beat almost all of the other single-
card systems we’ve tested in the last year, 
losing out to a GTX Titan X machine we 
tested late in 2016.
The Corsair One more than delivers 
on the promise of excellent gaming 
performance in a small package. Even 
better, it does so without relying on large, 
loud fans to keep everything cool. For 
most small form factor systems, heat 
management is often their Achilles’ 
heel. Not so with the One: Performance 
remained stable even after running our 
high-load benchmarks simultaneously. 
Of course, pre-built systems are well 
known for adding a small price premium 
over the cost of building the rig yourself. 
However, if you add together the individual 
cost of everything packed inside the One, 
you reach a price not much cheaper than 
the cost of the complete system, especially 
when you add in Windows and the time it 
takes to build it. Either way, Corsair brings 
a lot to the table here. For one, small form 
factor systems are especially tough to 
build inside, and the innards of the One are 
manicured with precision. Similarly, the 
One’s custom chassis isn’t the kind of thing 
you can easily recreate yourself. There’s 
also the added benefit of a manufacturer’s 
warranty—the One comes with two years 
of parts and labor covered. But, most of 
all, it’s the ease of having a plug-and-
play gaming system that looks great and 
performs even better—and, for some, 
that’s priceless.
The One is nothing short of a major 
milestone 
for 
Corsair. 
Having 
made 
components and accessories for decades, 
the company is now in a position to fuse all 
of its strengths together into one beautifully 
designed tower of power. –bo Moore

As the 500lb gorillA of PC manufacturing, 
Dell can be a bit of a clumsy, lumbering 
corporate brute on occasion. But all that 
muscle does occasionally allow it to punch 
a little harder than the competition. 
Enter the newly revised XPS 15 
notebook system, the latest in a proud 
line of high-end, full-feature laptops from 
Dell. Immediately, it socks you squarely 
in the eyes with that gorgeous Infinity 
Edge display. It’s 15.6 inches in diagonal, 
but thanks to the vanishingly compact 
proportions of the bezels, the XPS is the 
smallest such laptop on the market. In 
other words, slim bezels don’t just look 
great, they have a practical benefit, too.
The screen is also utterly gorgeous 
to look at, thanks to IGZO IPS panel 
technology, and a full 4K pixel grid—that’s 
3,840x2,160 pixels. What’s more, Dell 
claims the new XPS 15 with this 4K screen 
option is also the only laptop to support 
100 percent of the Adobe RGB color space. 
Graphics pros will love this screen.
If there is an issue with the display, it 
involves scaling. For starters, Windows 
simply doesn’t scale DPI settings terribly 
well, even now. Nor, for that matter, does 
much of the web, which often still relies on 
bitmaps, and isn’t particularly DPI-aware. 
None of that has anything to do with Dell 
or the panel’s implementation—however, 
what Dell might be able to address is non-
native resolution scaling. The 4K pixel grid 
is precisely four times that of 1080p, so a 
simple pixel-doubling scaling option would 
Dell ups its XPS ante once more

allow the screen to have, in effect, two 
native resolutions. For gaming, that would 
be a huge boon. Instead, the XPS relies 
on standard non-native scaling, which 
slightly softens and blurs the image. Hold 
that thought.
Elsewhere, the XPS impresses with slick 
and solid design and engineering, thanks to 
metal top and bottom covers, and a very 
sturdy keyboard. The screen, incidentally, 
is also covered in Corning Gorilla Glass 
NBT for top-notch scratch resistance. 
While we’re talking physical attributes, the 
XPS’s power supply is pleasingly compact 
for what is a fairly powerful PC. Overall, 
the XPS 15, as a physical object, is about 
as good as PC notebooks get for perceived 
quality and material gorgeousness, even 
if it can’t quite match Apple’s ridiculously 
well-finished portables by those metrics.
Bed of roses?
But what of performance? You wouldn’t 
kick it out of bed, that’s for sure. 
Performance from the quad-core, eight-
thread Core i7 Intel chip is very much a 
known quantity, and probably as much 
raw CPU horsepower as all but the most 
demanding content-creation professional 
would require. The PCIe solid-state drive 
is another strong addition. It wasn’t all that 
long ago that storage was the weak link in 
a portable PC. Now, thanks to the latest 
NVMe storage tech, this XPS cranks out 4K 
random access performance that only the 
latest and very greatest desktop PCs could 
match. As for raw sequential throughput, 
we’re talking GB/s. It’s hella quick.
What isn’t so speedy is the Nvidia 
GeForce GTX 1050 graphics. Praise be—
Nvidia’s naming for mobile GPUs now lines 
up with its desktop parts. So, this is a real 
1050 GPU. But it’s also as lowly as Nvidia’s 
new Pascal graphics family gets. The 
upshot is what we’d characterize broadly 
as decent mobile gaming performance at 
1080p, depending on the title in question, 
and the settings you choose.
This is where that scaling issue we 
mentioned comes in. Admittedly, the XPS 
scales non-native resolutions as well as 
any system we’ve seen, but with true pixel 
doubling at 1080p, it would be as crisp as 
a native 1080p panel, and that would make 
for a much better match with the Nvidia 
1050 GPU. It doesn’t even nearly have the 
grunt to drive the panel at native 4K, that’s 
for sure. It’s really the only demerit in a 
very strong overall package, which also 
includes reasonable battery life for this 
class of system of over six hours of HD 
video playback. –JereMY lAirD

We generally don’t use extended theme 
park analogies to describe PC peripherals, 
but rarely has a headset ever taken us 
on a rollercoaster ride like this one did. 
We started sweating in the queue. The 
MasterPulse’s prime gimmick, a set of 
neodymium-magnet 
mounted 
plates, 
which click on to the outside of each 
ear cup, is a new experience. Properly 
installed, the plates infer a closed back 
design; removed, the headset converts to 
a semi-open configuration, and activates 
Cooler Master’s Bass FX tech for a far fatter 
sound. Two distinct sounds in one headset, 
with a completely analog way of converting 
from one to the other. Either this is a feat of 
audio engineering, or something we really 
don’t want to be riding.
And so we strap in. Cooler Master has 
definitely got the construction right—
getting the MasterPulse nestled on your 
skull is a highly pleasant experience. 
The ear pads are generous, soft, and 
easily encompass the biggest ears and 
the oddest-shaped skulls, despite the 
stiff, fixed construction of the headband. 
Floating padding, with five individual 
squishy nodules, does a great job of 
securing the headset to your scalp 
without any noticeable pressure, and the 
lightweight aluminum construction only 
helps long wearing. The only way these 
aren’t going to sit comfortably is if you 
favor the half-on, half-off configuration—
popular in the prank-filled Maximum PC 
office, because the isolation of full cans 
does a number on one’s ability to hear 
ongoing shenanigans—in which case, the 
tightness of the headband is going to crush 
your ear cartilage. An edge case, but one 
to be aware of.
Cable guy
We should mention the cable at this point, 
which is a little disappointing. Not for its 
in-line mic and analog volume control, 
although relegating the mic to a tiny pin-
prick on the top of the cable module does, for 
all the acceptable quality of voice capture, 
make it seem like a massive afterthought. 
And not for its color—a pleasing deep red—
or its coating; slightly rubbery and pretty 
good at not transferring physical noise into 
the earphones. No, it’s the length, or lack

of it. A shade under four feet, or slightly 
more if you use the included four-pole to 
2x three-pole adapter, just isn’t enough for 
most desktop PC configurations. It’s barely 
enough to use this headset hooked up to a 
phone in your pocket.
The listening experience is where the 
rollercoaster analogy really comes into 
play, because we hit a ton of high-speed 
ups, downs, and loop-the-loops with 
the MasterPulse. First listen is like that 
terrifying first drop of a steel coaster, 
particularly with the side plates removed: 
A massive blast of bass overwhelms your 
senses. You lurch into the first corner, 
and put the side plates back on; the bass 
subsides, but only just. There’s not a 
massive chasm of difference between the 
two configurations, apart from a slightly 
more hollow sound with the Bass FX tech 
deactivated. At first listen, everything is a 
little muddy; there’s no remarkable high 
point to the sound stage. But then you 
settle in for the ride, and things aren’t 
quite as terrifying as they first seemed. 
Long-term listening isn’t offensive, it’s 
almost fun. There’s a bouncy quality to 
the plate-clad sound, at least. It’s rich 
enough in bass to suit gaming very well, 
if not flat enough for audiophile music 
listeners, and it goes plenty loud without 
any noticeable distortion.
This is entertaining, then, but not the 
best ride in the park by any means. Its $70 
MSRP puts it only about 20 bucks away 
from our perennial headset comparison, 
the HyperX Cloud II, and that’s leagues 
ahead in terms of features, performance, 
and long-term enjoyment. If, however, you 
can get a cut-price ticket—we’ve seen the 
MasterPulse listed by major retailers as 
low as $29.99—then you’re going to have a 
lot of fun. –alex Cox

Finding a 240mm dual rad at this price 
is fairly impressive. There are a few 
alternatives from the likes of Cooler 
Master and Thermaltake, both with their 
own flaws, but the biggest challenge 
comes from Corsair’s Hydro H105 240mm 
AIO. Coming in at $104, it’s only $4 more 
than the Frostflow 240L, and that’s a 
problem for the plucky underdog. 
Whether it’s the mounting system, the 
materials, the finish, you name it—the 
Frostflow falls short in almost every way. 
But that’s to be expected. Corsair is a 
well-known brand, one that almost single-
handedly pioneered AIO liquid-cooling. 
The mounting system isn’t awful—the 
fact you can mount it in stages, without 
needing to balance the two parts together, 
makes it fairly effective. The problem? The 
backplate. It’s steel, and is padded with 
a block of foam to prevent shorts upon 
contact with the mobo. Not a terrible idea, 
but with support for 1366, 1150/X, and 775 
sockets, there’s a plethora of holes precut 
into the foam to allow you to thread your 
screws through. Except the holes are all 
a touch too small. Pushing them through 
begins to tear the foam away from the 
backplate. The best way to install them 
is to thread them through the opposite 
side first, pushing the foam against the 
backplate, to widen the openings, then

push them back through the correct way. 
Then it’s a case of lining up your backplate 
with the holes in your mobo, attaching 
washers on the motherboard side, and 
securing the backplate with four long 
threaded nuts acting as stand-offs. After 
which, thermal paste down, CPU block on, 
and secure in place with the thumb screws.
But the big problem is appearance. It’s 
hard to get past how cheap the Frostflow 
looks. The braided cable is nice, the rad a 
decent quality, but the fans and CPU block 
seem crafted out of cheap plastic, designed 
to break upon impact. The texture is just 
unpleasant, and the LED ring oscillating 
round in a circle is untameable by any form 
of desktop control. 
That said, it’s not all about looks. And 
where the Frostflow does shine is in its 
performance. It’s a strong contender in 
the 240mm market, performing as well 
as any we’ve seen, even giving our 280mm 
NZXT Kraken X62 a run for its money. It’s 
not a super-thick radiator, but the included 
fans do a good job of shifting enough cool 
air past the radiator fins to draw excess 
heat out of the system without causing a 
ruckus. Our testing suite lets the standard 
PWM fan profiles included with Asus’s 
Maximus IX Hero manage the fan speed, 
and it was fairly inaudible even under load. 
ID-Cooling’s Frostflow is a flawed 
yet interesting first product from the 
new kid on the block. It throws punches 
and includes LED lighting that other 
competitors don’t at this price. Yet it falls 
flat on overall design, and could do with a 
touch of refinement when it comes to the 
AIO mounting procedure. –ZaK STOREY

Since they emerged from the damp, beige, 
angular swamp of the early ’90s, mice 
have—at least in comparison to the rest of 
the PC peripheral market—been objects of 
scant innovation. Mainly because, really, 
where is there to go? A thing that fits your 
hand, some buttons, a wheel, and a sensor 
that determines how you’re moving the 
thing. Those components are frequently 
refined, but where’s the next big change? 
What can make the mouse new again? Well, 
if you’re Asus, you’ll find at least some 
of that innovation inspiration both in the 
current trend of adding RGB LED lighting 
to absolutely everything, and beneath the 
chassis of the most pimped-out rides.
So, let’s begin with the Gladius II’s big 
shiny selling point, that RGB illumination, 
an upgrade from the primo Gladius’s plain 
old red wheel and palm light. It’s actually 
quite fun. As much as we’d like to give it 
a curmudgeonly dismissal, the LEDs—
which hook up to Asus’s Aura Sync lighting 
protocol—look brilliant, the underlights 
projecting a halo on to your mousing 
surface in whatever color (or colors) you 
choose, pulsating or breathing if you 
wish, helping you pick out your mouse in 
darkened locations, and generally giving 
you the standard cheap thrill of RGB jollies. 
That Aura Sync integration means you can, 
in theory, line up your mouse’s lighting 
with that of the rest of your components—
as long as you’ve bought Asus, of course. 
The other step up from Gladius the 
First is the addition of a thumb-seated 
resolution button which, if you’re running 
in high DPI mode, drops the res (thus 
slowing your mouse and increasing your 
accuracy) for as long as it’s depressed. 
Having this function so close at hand is a 
bit of a double-edged sword. It’s easy to

the space might well have been better 
served by a customizable button, but its 
position does mean that there’s no need 
to fumble around—it’s exactly where you 
need it in the middle of a virtual firefight. 
Above the sniper button, there’s a pair of 
additional action buttons, quickly activated 
by sliding your thumb upward. Waggle 
your middle finger sufficiently, and you’ll 
find a comfortably notched and rubberized 
wheel, behind which is a DPI toggle, which 
jumps between the mouse’s two modes. 
Reasonably standard mouse stuff. The 
sensor, at 12,000 dpi, is ridiculously 
sensitive, as are the left and right buttons, 
at least by default. Included in the package 
is a pair of stiffer replacement Omron 
microswitches, 
easily 
substituted 
by 
unscrewing the mouse’s case, pulling out 
the old ones, and push-fitting the new—the 
alternatives are perfect for those of us with 
heavy fingers, and more Omron switches 
are available online.

Innovation being what it is, though, nothing 
here is actually brand new. Razer’s 
well-regarded DeathAdder Chroma, for 
example, has underlighting based on its 
own RGB protocol, while thumb-mounted 
DPI shifters are reasonably commonplace 
in 
gaming 
mice. 
Easily 
replaceable 
microswitches, at least those that don’t 
require solder, are significantly rarer, but 
not absolutely unknown. So we need to 
assess this based on the whole package, 
rather than any one of its individual 
features. And, as a whole, the Gladius II is 
pretty damn awesome. 
It’s 
super-comfortable 
to 
hold 
in 
both palm and claw grips, aided by the 
pleasant textured rubberized edges. The 
combination of silicon pads and rubber 
bungs on the underside results in a 
slippery movement feel with satisfying 
bite. Everything is easy to reach, the 
locking detachable cable system works 
well, and despite testing it on a large 
number of potential mousing surfaces, 
we were unable to trip up the sensor even 
slightly. Fantastic.

justify 
an $85 MSRP, though? Well, it’s not

DeathAdder Chroma can be had for a fair

mouse for $30, so it depends on what price 
you put on such indulgence. –Alex cox

WindoWs’ built-in File History is fine, but 
what PCs need, and it pains us to say this, 
is something like Apple’s Time Machine. 
An app that grinds away in the background, 
incrementally backing up your files, and 
which can be accessed to drop a particular 
version of a particular file on to your 
desktop, should you need to recover it.
In these days of cloud storage, you 
may question the value of a backup app. 
With all your documents mirrored on 
Google or Dropbox’s servers, why bother 
backing up to a local disk? Anyone who’s 
had to use System Restore to recover from 
a ransomware attack, or struggled to 
find a file that someone else has deleted 
from a shared folder, will appreciate an 
easily accessed local repository of your 
data. Crazy-named German developer 
Ashampoo thinks it’s got a solution 
with Backup Pro, which can back up 
entire drives, including hidden and UEFI 
partitions, 
to 
local 
drives, 
network 
locations, or even the cloud. Individual 
files and folders can be backed up, too, 
according to a manifest you create.
The latter of these will be of interest 
for anyone looking for a File History 
replacement, because it enables you to 
create a backup that can be explored as a 
standard Windows directory. Versions of 
files can be kept for a period of time set by 
you when you create the backup plan, and 
zip compression can be added so you don’t 
use titanic amounts of disk space. You’ll 
Backup software is boring—until you need it
still use plenty, though, especially if you’re 
keeping multiple versions of large files 
backed up several times a day. But there’s 
enough control in the settings to ensure 
you’re not backing up multiple copies of 
videos that never change.
For a complete backup solution, it 
makes sense to run both types of backup 
on a plan that backs up your documents 
more often than your operating system. 
This way, should you ever need to restore 
your system following a freak EMP 
accident, you’ll have a reasonably up-to-
date system image, and the most recent 
copies of your documents.
Backup Pro’s interface is particularly 
straightforward to use. You start by 
creating a backup plan, choosing what’s 
backed up and where to, how long it’s 
kept, and whether you want a report of any 
errors emailed to you. The app doesn’t stop 
backing up just because it’s encountered 
an error or thinks there’s something wrong 
with your target drive (we’ve found File 
History guilty of this), but instead tells you 
what went wrong, and what wasn’t backed 
up. This seems a more reliable way of 
doing things, because most of a backup is 
better than no backup at all. 
If the worst does happen, and you 
need to rescue your PC, Ashampoo has 
a comprehensive suite of tools to get 
you up and running again—although 
they’re only useful if you use them before 
disaster strikes. You can make a rescue 
USB drive or DVD, which invokes the 
Windows 
Preinstallation 
Environment, 
from where you can restore whole drives, 
including boot partitions, to a freshly 
formatted or installed disk. This is a very 
powerful feature, making it relatively 
straightforward, if not actually less 
stressful, to recover an apparently bricked 
machine. The stress doesn’t stop until it’s 
working again.

500GB on our external drive. Everybody’s 
usage will be different, as the PC is a 
wonderfully diverse system, but this brings 
a full system backup within the reach of 
cheap external drives. What you need to 
decide is whether your data is worth the 
outlay, or whether you’re happy to remain 
with Windows’ File History, cloud storage, 
or free solutions. –ian evenden

Facial animation glitches are undeniably 
funny. Also funny is the moment your

while talking to his crewmates, or when an 
enemy freezes, inviting an assault rifle to

be more than the sum of its bugs, however. 
If you’ve played the other ME games, 
you know what to expect: an RPG you play 
like a shooter, or maybe the other way 
round, in space, with mutually pleasurable 
interspecies mating-port-stimulation a

creator in which you can make any number 
of grotesques, and a car in which you can 
roar around on planetary surfaces, causing 
trouble. This familiarity isn’t necessarily a 
criticism, though, as it enables you to settle 
more quickly into a new situation. When that 
new situation is the same as those that have 
gone before, well, that would be a criticism.
So, some time during the events of Mass

the similarities to Mass Effect 1 and Dragon 
Age Inquisition (in both structure and the 
way you carve a space-empire from the 
smoking corpses of aliens) is less obvious.
The best bits of Andromeda remind us 
how good Mass Effect can be. The rest 
provides a solid base for the inevitable 
trilogy to build on. It’s well crafted, despite 
bugs that will surely be patched out, and 
shows that a franchise reboot doesn’t have

Dead Rising 4
DeaD Rising games have never been subtle, 
and DR4 is a riot of button-mashing combat, 
bizarre weapons, and more targets than 
you could ever take down. Pushing a large 
number of character models on screen at 
once, previous games have brought frame 
rates crashing down. 
No such problems with Dead Rising 4—
we raised the game’s initially conservative 
graphics settings for our GTX 970 to Very 
High without dropping much below 60fps. 
But it’s not the most refined-looking game 
out there, with very boxy environmental 
details, and a restrained color palette.
It’s not refined in play, either, as 
photojournalist Frank West, returning from 
the first game, mulches his way through the 
undead. Also returning is the shopping mall 
setting, used in Dawn of the Dead as a sharp 
satire on consumerism, though Capcom 
blunts the point by having the zombie 
outbreak occur on Black Friday. What 
haven’t returned are the earlier games’ 
timers, which piled on the pressure. DR4’s 
zombie-slaying is more relaxed, with only 
the health bars of your allies reminding you 
music is everywhere. It’s the perfect ironic 
soundtrack to the slaughter. The zombie 
horde is mixed up by other enemies, military 
operatives, and “maniacs”—including a 
giant turkey—but once dealt with, it’s back 
into the sea of human flesh once again.
Maybe that’s Dead Rising 4’s downfall. 
You’re dropped into the mall early on, 
and—even though it’s not a long game, and 
there are other locations—hacking your 
way through animated corpses, soldiers, 
and giggling maniacs becomes a bit samey.

weapons, and taken the photos, what more 
is there for Frank to do? –ian evenDen

also a modern checkpoint and save system, 
consigning the save rooms of earlier games 
to a deserted graveyard somewhere, and 
Frank can craft new weapons anywhere,

This is all to the good, as DR4 offers a 
bewildering number of combo weapons, 
constructed from blueprints and seeing 
grenades strapped to sledgehammers, 
fireworks connected to crossbows, and 
various uses for electric prods and liquid

Guns are less satisfying than huge sweeps

Don’t get me wrong, I have a cushy job—I’m 
fully aware of that. But that doesn’t detract 
from the fact that motherboard group tests 
are some of the most infuriating roundups 
you can ever work on. Soul destroying.
Take Z170, for example. You pick five 
to ten motherboards, and choose a whole 
suite of benchmarks to check performance 
across multiple factors: rendering, gaming, 
storage support, overclocking. The thing is, 
you’re not looking for variance, but for them 
all to be identical. Reason being, a good 
motherboard shouldn’t affect performance 
outside 
of 
overclocking. 
If 
it 
does, 
something’s going wrong somewhere, and 
you can bet your last dollar that power draw, 
clock speeds, or any number of other factors 
will be far higher than they should be.
Take Ryzen, on the other hand, and 
you’re welcomed into a whole new world of 
hurt. New architectures and chip designs 
are fraught with problems. Realistically 
speaking, Intel’s Core architecture design 
is coming up to 11 years old. It may receive 
tweaks here and there, added I/O support, 
and drops in transistor size, but that’s about 
it. In short, it has essentially been the same 
design layout since the days of Sandy Bridge. 
If you compare Ryzen to Piledriver, however, 
it’s entirely different. A completely new 
design from the ground up. And because of 
that, it’s loaded with problems, particularly 
on the BIOS front, as AIB partners race to 
release a new and improved BIOSes with 
better support for memory, and general 
overclocking stability for a chip that isn’t just 
a rehash of a design that’s been gradually 
refined for the last 11 years.
To cut a long story short, I killed two 
motherboards via BIOS updates, another 
was dead on arrival, and I managed to nuke 
one of our Ryzen 1800X samples in the 
process of this group test. To say it was hell 
would be an understatement.

I fInally caveD, and invested in a pair 
of Bluetooth headphones for my training. 
My Galaxy S7 Edge has taken numerous 
beatings over the last year. It was with 
me when I had the biggest crash of 
my life, in the pouring rain, effectively 
saving my life in one gnarly mountain 
bike accident. It’s operated through dirt, 
grit, and grime, in and out of rugged 
cases. But, alas, the headphone jack has 
sighed its last. And, annoyingly, mostly 
due to my own error—I took a toothpick, 
and tried to scrape out the fluff that had 
accumulated inside. When I plugged my 
headphones back in, it was dead.
I can’t train without music (yes, I’m 
one of those antisocial types), so I had 
no choice but to invest in something I’ve 
scorned ever since Apple announced it 
was dropping the headphone jack.
So, what can I say about the Panasonic 
Wings RP-BTS30? They’re actually pretty 
good. Once you get them to sit right, the 
moldable ear lock can be shaped to fit 
any ear, they lock securely into place, 
and the onside buttons are quite effective 
when you get used to them. Audio quality 
is, well, acceptable—but when you’re 
exerting all that physical energy, audio 
quality isn’t top of your agenda.
As far as battery life goes, you can 
expect six to seven hours at full volume, 
which is modestly loud—not particularly 
ear-damaging, but not inaudible either. 
Battery is the biggy, though, and having 
these go dead on you, midway through a 
training session, is simply depressing. 
These are a solid pair of affordable 
Bluetooth headphones, but if charging 
these mini cans every day is too onerous, 
you might be better off investing in a pair 
of analogs instead. –ZS

just 
finished 
rolling out its Ryzen 7 
and Ryzen 5 CPUs, and 
do you know which is my 
favorite? Not the 1800X 
or even the 1700, though the 1700 does come 
in second. No, the best of the current crop of 
seven Ryzen CPUs is the 1600. Stock clocks 
are pretty tame at only 3.2–3.6GHz, but like 
all Ryzens, it’s fully multiplier unlocked, so 
you can overclock to the same 3.9–4.0GHz 
that you’ll hit with higher priced Ryzen chips.
It’s not just about overclocking, though. 
I do like the eight-core Ryzen 7 chips, 
but they’re in the high-end market, with 
the least expensive starting at $330. At 
just $220, the 1600 makes six-core/12-
thread computing truly affordable. And 
you’re not restricted to more expensive 
“enthusiast” motherboards. Pair this puppy 
up with a B350 mobo and some decent 
DDR4-3200 memory, and you’re looking at 
similar performance to Intel’s six-core i7-
5820K/6800K at about half the cost.
Just don’t get stuck in the rut of chasing the 
final 100MHz of overclocking performance. 
That usually requires substantially more 
voltage, which means more heat. Even at 
3.9GHz, the Ryzen 5 1600 is super-capable, 
and will smoke any similarly priced Core i5 
when it comes to CPU-intensive workloads.

Master Overclocking
I recently built a new gaming 
PC. It’s been 15 years or so 
since I last built one, and I’d 
say I did quite well. I’ve been 
running “custom specced” 
gaming laptops for several 
years due to their portability 
and ease of use. My new 
build is an Intel Core i7-
7700k, Asus TUF Z270 Mark 
1, G.Skill Trident Z 3600 
32GB, Samsung 850 Evo 1TB 
SSD, Seagate Barracuda 4TB 
SATA 6GB, EVGA FTW 1080 
GTX, Corsair H100vi, EVGA 
Supernova 1,200W P2 PSU, 
and Acer xb1 27hu. 
This was my dream 
machine, and I finally saved 
enough money to build it. It 
has been up and running for 
a month or two, and I have 
an assortment of the latest 
games on it. My question lies 
in overclocking—I guess I’m 
not getting it, so to speak. 
I’ve read a ton of forums 
and seen tons of videos. 
At first, it didn’t seem like 
my graphics card even 
“turned on.” Games were 
very glitchy, and frame rates 
sucked. I’ve never been an 
overclocker, so I’m a noob. 
I use EVGA OCX software 
for my GPU, and stock Asus 
BIOS for CPU overclocks. 
When booting, OC is set to 
automatic for performance 
through mobo, and it says 
I’m overclocked 9 percent. 
On my EVGA OCX, I simply 
run at 120 percent power 
target, and 92 C temp target, 
and that seemed to “turn on” 
my GPU. I get good FPS, but 
it feels like I’m missing out. 
Heaven crashes if I adjust 
the GPU clock offset 25-125, 
which people say my card 
should easily achieve. 
I have not messed with 
power in any way. I am afraid 
of ruining what I worked 
on forever to build. I’m just 
looking for OC advice, so I 
can get the most out of my 
dream machine. I know how 
to watch temps, and have 
an idea how Heaven works, 
but I feel like my system is 
capable of so much more, 
and I just don’t know how 
or what to tweak to unlock 
its true power. Or maybe 
my rig isn’t as powerful as I 
thought. Any help would be 
appreciated.  –Ryan Havens
Reviews editoR Zak 
stoRey Responds: Sounds 
like you’ve got quite the 
conundrum occurring with 
your GTX 1080 there. That’s 
one mightily impressive 
system, to say the least. 
You certainly shouldn’t 
be seeing any frame rate 
issues at 1440p with that 
setup, even on the latest 
AAA titles.
I have to apologize in 
advance, but there’s a few 
things we need to get clear 
before we start. Firstly, 
how hot is your CPU running 
after an hour or two of idling 
on desktop? I suggest using 
HWMonitor to check this. It’s 
possible the cooler might 
not be mounted correctly, 
and the CPU is overheating 
and bottlenecking your 
GPU. Also, are you definitely 
running the DisplayPort 
cable from the monitor 
into the back of the 
graphics card, and not the 
motherboard? I know it 
sounds obvious, but we just 
have to double-check.
Next up, I’d suggest 
downloading the basic 
version of 3DMark Fire 
Strike, and running the 
standard Fire Strike 
benchmark at stock settings 
(with no overclocking 
profiles applied in EVGA 
OCX), and seeing what score 
you get. Ideally, what we’re 
looking for, with a base GTX 
1080, is a score higher than 
17,000 or so.
Also, could you go 
into a little more detail 
about these glitches 
you’re seeing? During 
overclocking, it’s common 
to see the screen flicker, or 
particular textures flicker, 
when the GPU is clocked too 
high, becoming unstable. 
This can look like all sorts—
basically, something out of 
the norm; the colors purple 
and pink, in particular, turn 
up a lot in quick flashes, too.
If I were to hazard a 
guess, I’d say it’s possible 
you’ve been particularly 
unlucky in the Silicon 
Lottery with your GPU. And 
that it may already be at its 
very limits when it comes to 
core overclocks, after you 
set the overclock profile. 
We’ve had cards in the 
past that fail to run at their 
stated overclock profile. 
An Asus Strix GTX 1080, in 
particular, had continual 
bugs, and crashed when we 
ran our benchmarking suite 
at its “OC” profile in GPU 
Tweak. It’s possible you may 
be in the same position.
If we can deduce that 
this is the case, then it’s 
potentially worth getting 
in touch with EVGA, and 
seeing if you can RMA your 
card, as it’s not operating at 
its advertized frequencies. 
Alternatively, you could run 
the card at stock, without 
the overclock profile, or 
even underclock it a touch 
to improve stability.

A Route to Love
You’ve had many features on 
cases, but regrettably few 
on routers. The last I can 
remember was a feature on 
budget routers in October 
2014. I’m in the market for 
a new and more capable 
802.11ac router. Our router 
is the centerpiece of our 
home network, often with as 
many as 16 devices (phones, 
tablets, and PC) connected. 
While routers don’t have 
as much marketing zing as 
GPUs and CPUs (or cases), 
they deserve a little love too.
  
–Cliff Steer
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: Routers 
are still an essential piece 
of our connected lives, but 
things have calmed down a 
lot recently, which is why 
we haven’t looked at them 
in a while. They are on our 
“big list of things to cover,” 
though, and your letter 
means that such coverage 
has just shuffled a little 
closer to seeing the light of 
day. In the meantime, here 
are Tuan’s thoughts:
It all depends on what 
you’re looking for in your 
new “more capable” router. 
For the best range, the TP-
Link Archer C7 (v2) is your 
best bet. It has incredible 
range performance, and is 
priced very competitively. 
Depending on your home 
size, you may also want 
to consider mesh routers, 
which blanket your entire 
dwelling in sweet radio 
waves. But mesh routers 
tend to lack power-user 
features. For the ultimate 
in features, you might want 
to check out Netgear’s X10 
Nighthawk. It’s a cutting-
edge 802.11ad router that’ll 
knock the pants off your old 
model. The only caveat is 
that it’s $400. 
Carpal Diem
The List recently featured 
the seven best keyboards. 
How come none are 
ergonomic? How come you 
never test ergo keyboards? 
As a gamer, they’re a 
godsend. 
–Chris Ajemian
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: 
Ergonomic keyboards were 
all the rage a few years 
back, and even this jaded 
old hack briefly jumped 
on the bandwagon to see 
what all the fuss was 
about—I’ll freely admit that 
I have a soft spot for the 
pale Microsoft Ergonomic 
keyboard that I used for a 
few years, despite it taking 
up a ludicrous amount of 
desk space. The problem 
is, the actual benefits of 
the slightly more relaxed 
hand position are hard 
to prove, and keyboard 
manufacturers saw 
demands for such devices 
dwindle, forcing them to be 
little more than niche genre. 
If you’re definitely sold on 
them, though, we see that 
there are plenty of options 
available on the likes of 
Newegg, so we suggest you 
just grab a more recent 
model from a manufacturer 
that you trust (Microsoft 
gets the nod from us on this 
front). As a final note, we do 
intend to look at ergonomics 
in the future, and keyboards 
will make an appearance as 
part of that.
Buyer’s Remorse
Jeremy Laird’s article 
regarding Intel Optane (April 
issue) was interesting to say 
the least, but I have a feeling 
Intel’s speed claims are 
wildly overstated, and AMD 
is certainly in no danger 
after its release of Ryzen. 
Time will tell regarding 
Optane, but I’m currently in 
the market for a processor 
and graphics card upgrade. 
For the first time since 2006, 
I’m looking AMD’s way after 
reading several Internet 
reviews and finally receiving 
yours of Ryzen. The price to 
performance ratio is nothing 
short of amazing, from what 
I am reading, and Intel has 
me a bit disgruntled when 
my last upgrade (Sandy 
Bridge to Haswell) produced 
but a “tick” of performance 
increase. I had buyer’s 
remorse for months. Love 
the magazine, and thank you 
for the hard work.
–Ryan Anthony
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: We’ll 
have a few more updates 
on Optane through the 
year, and while you may 
be right as far as the final 
performance is concerned, 
we’re cautiously optimistic 
about what it could deliver. 
As for Ryzen, we have 
certainly been impressed 
by the performance it 
offers, and at a great price, 
too, although those early 
teething problems have us 
being a little cautious at the 
same time. 
Making Viruses
First, I really like Maximum 
PC. Your staff of experts 
keep me close to the pointy 
end of the stick when it 
comes to the latest news 
in the computing field. I do 
have a question, which is: 
Who is creating all these 
viruses that we have to 
cope with, and what is their 
motivation? This has been 
going on for years, and I am 
just curious.  
–Ray Dovel
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: It may 
amaze you to discover, 
but there are actual virus 
kits available these days 
that mean that anyone 
who wants to can create a 
virus fairly easily. So the 
“who” is probably less 
important than the “why.” 
Unfortunately, apart from 
being a mental exercise 
in circumventing various 
protection systems, the 
reasons for creating 
malicious code aren’t 
obvious either. Slightly 
more straightforward is 
the current fad in creating 
ransomware, which at 
least has a motive with 
a more basic end goal—
extracting money from 
people’s infected machines. 
We’re not condoning such 
activities, obviously, just 
trying to understand 
who does this, and why. 
But yes, the whole idea 
behind viruses isn’t exactly 
straightforward, other than 
some people just want to 
watch the world burn.

Protect your Privacy 
and Pc online
Keeping your data to yourself on the Internet is hard, and 
it’s getting tougher every day. With the recent decision by 
Congress to let Internet service providers continue to run 
wild with your browsing data without you knowing, a lot of 
people are pissed (and the ones who aren’t probably should 
be). While it’s true that a lot of us give up data in exchange 
for services (think Google, Facebook, and other applications), 
an ISP is different. Without an ISP, you can’t get online at 
all. Your wireless provider, cable company, or copper-wire 
telco generally set prices in a vacuum, and are the first 
gatekeepers between you and your Steam account. Read the

We haven’t changed a single component in our mainstream build. 
This is mainly because pricing across the board has been stable (and 
that tends to be the driving factor for change), but also because we’re 
eyeing up switching the mainstream system over to Ryzen soon. 
We’re not quite ready to pull the trigger just yet, as we want to take 
a longer look at the other Ryzen 5 chips, but all being well, you can 
expect changes shortly. For now, though, this system still demands 
respect: It’s a powerful mid-range system that looks great, has plenty 
of raw performance, and offers space for upgrades. We saw the price 
of the Zotac graphics card drop by $10, but this was eaten up by an 
increase for the Intel M.2 drive. Elsewhere, we saw a $5 increase on 
the power supply pricing, while the RAM dropped in price. Admittedly 
only by a single dollar, but it still gives us hope that we’ve weathered 
the RAM pricing storm, and that cheaper memory for all is the result. 
there aren’t many changes to the budget system this month—
although, given we’re happy with the base of the Pentium G4600, that’s 
no bad thing. There are no price shifts on the CPU, motherboard, or 
graphics card front, although this hasn’t stopped us changing one of 
those items: The Gigabyte GTX 1060 Mini ITX OC 3GB boasts a higher 
core clock speed over the EVGA we used in last month’s build, all for 
the same cash. The Gigabyte card runs the core at 1,556MHz in OC 
Mode, boosting up to 1,771MHz, which equates to slightly smoother 
performance. The other changes are on the storage front, as we saw 
SSD prices shuffle upward again, so back to the SanDisk Z410 once 
more. To offset its price increase slightly, we swapped to a Western 
Digital hard drive, which helped bring the price in slightly cheaper 
than last month. It’s worth noting that Ubuntu 17.04 is now available, 
although we’d recommend sticking with the LTS for now.

We’ve managed to squeeze the price of our Turbo build under 
$3,000 this issue, shaving off over $100 without affecting its power or 
functionality. There’s a couple of reasons for that, but the switch to the 
MSI X370 Gaming Pro Carbon is fundamental, because it’s $75 cheaper 
than the Asus Crosshair VI Hero that we’ve been recommending until 
now. The outgoing board is still a great option, but MSI’s Pro Carbon 
gets the nod this issue as it has a great feature set, performs well, and 
manages to back that up with great value for money. There’s a reason 
it took home the trophy from this month’s AM4 roundup.
Motherboard aside, we also saw a couple of price drops to 
help things along. The $30 drop on the top-end Ryzen 7 1800X was 
unexpected, but welcome. The HyperX RAM was the other component 
to see a price drop—again, hopefully signaling an end to the price hikes 
we’ve seen recently. It’s worth keeping an eye out for bundles when 
picking up your motherboard and processor, as you can often save a 
few bucks on the components you were going to buy anyway—bundles 
with graphics cards and/or RAM are the most common, although just 
the CPU and motherboard on their own can save a bit of cash, too. 
The last thing we changed was the data drive, as the 5TB Black 
wasn’t available this time around, so we’ve gone with the slightly 
cheaper 4TB model instead—it’s still plenty of local storage, and if you 
need more, you should probably be looking at a NAS anyway.  
UpGRaDE of ThE MoNTh
Whenever a new graphics card comes out, we retest our suite 
of cards with the latest drivers to see how everything lines up, 
and it’s at times like this that we can reassess an otherwise 
known entity. That’s exactly what has happened with the 
release of the RX 580—it’s made us look at the 3GB spin of 
the GTX 1060 in a new light, and it’s a light that makes this 
aging card shine. For less than $200, you get a card that can 
handle 1080p gaming at 60fps at the highest settings. Unless 
you’ve got a higher-resolution screen, there’s no reason to go 
for anything higher.
