Nonprofit Bookkeeping & Accounting For Dummies 
xvi

Introduction
C
ounting the money in your wallet or purse is an act of accounting. If you 
ever make a note of how much you have, you’re even performing a 
bookkeeping function. You count things all the time in everyday life without 
thinking twice about accounting. For example, you count the plates before 
setting the table at home. You count the number of e-mails you receive while 
you’re out of the office. Even a gesture such as looking at your watch and 
thinking about how much time you have before your next appointment is a 
form of accounting.
Bookkeeping and accounting are service activities that involve auditing, 
tax services, management advisory services, general accounting, cost 
accounting, budgeting, and internal auditing. Even though your organization 
is a nonprofit, these services are essential parts of your daily activities. 
Without them, your nonprofit can’t survive the long haul.
In the wake of increased accountability, understanding how to track and 
account for the everyday activities of your nonprofit is important. Keeping 
the books for a nonprofit is exciting. Getting federal grant money to fund your 
programs relieves financial stress. Getting a clean bill of health from your 
financial audit adds credibility. I devote this book to all nonprofits that add 
credibility to the sector by keeping their books in order.
About This Book
Bookkeeping and accounting for an organization involve several fundamental 
steps. Beginning with a simple transaction such as a donation and ending 
with financial statements, you go through an accounting cycle of 12 months. 
The cycle repeats as long as your nonprofit continues to operate. To 
help you with the normal day-to-day transactions — as well as any sticky 
situations you may find along the way — I wrote this book for the nonprofit 
director and manager (as well as the nonprofit bookkeeper and accountant).
Feel free to use this book as a quick reference. It’s designed to help you 
with everything you need to know to operate your nonprofit according to 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It covers information 
about the steps to file your own payroll taxes and tax information Form 990. 
It also explains how to account for almost every situation that may come up 
in your nonprofit.

Nonprofit Bookkeeping & Accounting For Dummies 
This book serves as a tool that you can pick up from time to time during your 
accounting cycle to brush up on the following steps:
 
1. Your nonprofit enters into a transaction with a second party.
 
2. You or your employee prepares a business document, such as a sales 
invoice, that leaves a paper trail.
 
3. You or your employee records the transaction in the book of first 
entry, your journal.
 
4. You post the transaction to the general ledger.
 
5. You balance the general ledger and prepare a trial balance. Your trial 
balance tests the accuracy of account (debit and credit) balances.
 
6. You prepare your financial statements.
This book serves as a reference tool, no matter where you are in the 
accounting process, by helping you reach your ultimate goal of well-prepared 
and accurate financial statements.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I use the following conventions to help you find 
your way:
 
✓ Every time I introduce a new word, I italicize it and then define it.
 
✓ Boldface text is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or to 
highlight action parts of numbered steps.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web site addresses.
What You’re Not to Read
I understand that you’re a very busy person working in a small- to medium-
sized nonprofit. Every day throws different and unique challenges at you. 
You won’t hurt my feelings if you don’t read every word I’ve written. So if 
you’re strapped for time, feel free to skip the sidebars (the gray boxes). In 
sidebars, I include some real-world examples that you can skip — don’t 
worry, you won’t miss anything essential to understanding my point.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I made the following assumptions about you, my 
dear reader. Some may be more relevant than others.
 
✓ You’re the executive director of a newly formed, small nonprofit, and 
you want to know how to manage your own books.
 
✓ You direct or manage a midsize nonprofit and want to understand a little 
more about how to manage day-to-day operations and take care of your 
own books.
 
✓ You’re interested in keeping the books of a nonprofit organization.
 
✓ You’re interested in bookkeeping and accounting as a profession.
 
✓ You’ve been performing the functions in this book, but you’re not sure if 
you’ve been doing them right.
 
✓ You’re thinking about starting your own nonprofit and want to know 
how an effective nonprofit keeps track of its bookkeeping and 
accounting needs.
Finally, I assume you know that you can read this book over and over again 
and discover something new every time. You can refer to this book as a quick 
reference whenever you need to know the how-to of managing your financial 
records for your organization. I assume this book takes the guesswork out of 
bookkeeping and accounting and provides some peace of mind about how 
the system is designed and how you can work it to benefit your organization.
After reading this book, I hope you’re confident that you can take care of 
most of your bookkeeping and accounting needs yourself. At least, you can 
get a better handle on how your accounting cycle functions.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into five parts. You don’t have to read it from cover to 
cover; you can dip in for reference at any point that interests you and jump 
from part to part if you like. I won’t tell anyone.
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping 
Nonprofit Style
This part talks about basic bookkeeping and accounting terminology. You 
can also find a chapter that helps you understand financial statements. 

4
Nonprofit Bookkeeping & Accounting For Dummies 
And when you’re ready to get your hands dirty, you can read about record 
keeping and then decide whether to design your own computer system or 
use store-bought software.
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books
This part covers the nuts and bolts of setting up and balancing your non-
profit books. I cover how to set up a chart of accounts, how to record 
transactions in the bookkeeping journal, and how to make entries in and 
balance your nonprofit’s checkbook. Balancing your cash flows and planning 
your budget are two important aspects discussed in this part. If you’re not 
sure how to stay in compliance with federal nonprofit guidelines, follow the 
tips suggested here for help.
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit 
Situations
I should have named this part “Documentation 101” because that’s what the 
chapters here seem to boil down to. Part III focuses on grants, payroll, and 
accounting for Form 990, all of which are extremely important for keeping 
your nonprofit up and running. This part covers information about federal 
grants management and the grant audit. Everything you need to know about 
payroll taxes and filing Form 990 also is summarized here to keep you in good 
standing with the IRS and Uncle Sam. All of these tasks come back to staying 
organized and keeping a good paper trail.
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books
Part IV shows you how to create your own financial statements. It also 
describes the steps you have to take to close one accounting period and 
prepare the books for the next cycle. Finally, in this part, I cover what you 
need to do to prepare your books for an audit of your financial statements.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This is the famous For Dummies Part of Tens. You can find out how to keep 
your books in good standing and how to stay out of hot water with the 
federal government using the helpful tips in this part. After reading these 
chapters, you can feel confident that you’re indeed going about your books in 
the right way.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to get your attention in 
the margins. Here’s what they mean:
 
This icon highlights techniques or draws your attention to something 
noteworthy.
 
This icon highlights important information to keep in mind and points out 
things you shouldn’t forget.
 
This icon points out pitfalls and signals red flags of caution.
 
This icon points out real-life anecdotes from my years of experience and 
mistakes.
Where to Go from Here
Like every For Dummies book, each chapter stands alone, so you can jump 
from chapter to chapter and read whichever ones pique your interest. Glance 
at the table of contents and go to the topic that interests you. You can 
read this book in many ways, depending on your needs. If you’re new to the 
nonprofit arena, start with Part I. If you’re a veteran, I suggest you brush up 
on some info about filing your tax information in Part IV. Make plans to read 
the information more than once. You don’t have to remember this stuff; just 
pull your book out and use it as a reference as you need it.
This book is organized in an order logical to the accounting process, but you 
don’t need to read it from front to back to gain important insight and wisdom 
about the tricks of the trade. Feel free to read it cover to cover if you’re just 
biting at the bit to uncover everything you can about nonprofit bookkeeping 
and accounting.

Accounting and 
Bookkeeping 
Nonprofit Style

In this part . . .
B
efore you can dive into the pool of nonprofit book-
keeping and accounting, you have to be familiar with 
basic accounting terminology and financial statements. 
After grasping the fundamentals, you can account for your 
nonprofit activities. You may want to use a manual 
record-keeping system, or you may opt for a sophisticated 
computerized system instead. Which style you use 
doesn’t matter as long as you understand the mechanics 
of the trade.
As you put your toes in the water, you may be asking 
yourself a few questions: What is a debit? What is a 
credit? What is an asset? How do I begin keeping my 
accounting books in order? This part helps you answer 
these early questions and gives you a basic understanding 
of the bookkeeping and accounting processes you need to 
master to get an approved audit.

Chapter 1
The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit 
Bookkeeping and Accounting
In This Chapter
▶ Getting an overview of bookkeeping and accounting
▶ Performing a balancing act with your books
▶ Hitting up Uncle Sam for some free money
▶ Closing the year with financial statements
Your accounting year indicates the beginning of your accounting period 
and the end of your accounting period. This period may reflect the 
calendar year from January to December or some other 12-month period. If 
you use the calendar year, then the first transaction after January 1 starts 
your accounting cycle, and your last transaction on December 31 ends the 
cycle. You compile your financial statements after the cycle ends, get your 
financial statements audited, and start the cycle over again. It always feels 
good to finish something, doesn’t it? If you start with the end in mind, you 
have audited financial statements that summarize your accounting activities 
for the accounting period.
Now more than ever people are calling for accountability in the world of 
nonprofits. Long gone are the days when you can assume that your stake-
holders will just take your word that you’re successful at your mission and 
are spending their donations wisely. People want to see proof — cold, hard 
numbers in black and white. So you must dot every i and cross every t in 
your day-to-day operations.
Being accountable for your nonprofit requires that your books adequately 
reflect your activities. You need sound financial management by qualified 
individuals to keep your head above water. I wish you could focus only on 
your programs and the people whom you help, but you need a penny pincher 
and a number cruncher to keep up with the money coming in and going out. 
This chapter serves as a jumping off point into the world of nonprofit book-
keeping and accounting and touches on the important concepts. Throughout 
this book, I then dive deeper into these topics.

10
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Getting Started with Your 
Nonprofit’s Books
Before you can fully get going with your books, you first need to know where 
to begin. Start by identifying your destination: to have audited financial 
statements. You begin with a journal entry of a transaction, in which you 
record the exchange of something (money or time) for something else 
(products or services). Every financial transaction creates a record or 
document to support its occurrence. For example, if you buy a pen, you 
either give up cash or add to your charge account.
 
Adapting the habits of a packrat isn’t a bad idea when it comes to keeping up 
with your paperwork. Hold on to every receipt and record it in the proper 
location by posting to the right accounts. The central location of most transac-
tions starts with your checking account in which you make deposits from 
donors and write checks to pay the bills. The key to properly tracking your 
steps starts with your checkbook. (Check out Chapter 7 for more on getting a 
checkbook going.)
Of course, lots of things happen during the course of an accounting year. 
This section outlines the basics of nonprofit bookkeeping and accounting and 
what you need to understand before you can delve into your books.
Identifying the difference between 
bookkeeping and accounting
Before you can make sure your nonprofit’s books are okay, you need to 
have a firm understanding of bookkeeping and accounting. Here are the main 
differences. Chapter 2 provides more insight on the two.
A bookkeeper records day-to-day activities by recording one side of the 
transaction. They usually record transactions when cash changes hands 
(called the cash basis of accounting; see the next section for more details). 
Usually bookkeepers pass the books to the accountant at the end of the year 
to generate financial statements.
Accountants balance both sides of a transaction (the debit and credit sides) 
by evaluating how one transaction affects two or more accounts. Accounting 
isn’t complicated mathematics; it’s adding, subtracting, dividing, and multi-
plying, with some analysis thrown in based on principles and rules written 
by the profession. Accountants dig a bit deeper into understanding the 
treatment of accounts or the right way to handle financial situations based 
on principles. A bookkeeper may not be able to analyze accounts, but she 
can record the transaction.

11
 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
You may say, well, what’s the real difference here. Accountants understand 
the why of everything that takes place, whereas a bookkeeper may not grasp 
the concept behind the action. I’m not saying that bookkeepers function like 
robots, but some bookkeepers haven’t had the level of education as an 
accountant. Accountants have a minimum of a four-year degree, whereas a 
bookkeeper may be trained on the job to perform her duties.
Accountants also get paid more than bookkeepers. You’re likely to have 
a bookkeeper on your payroll to perform day-to-day functions and an 
accountant on retainer to put together reports on a quarterly or annual basis.
Some accountants take a standardized test, called the CPA exam, to prove 
they know the mechanics and ins and outs of the profession. Accountants 
who pass the test are called certified public accountants (CPAs). CPAs are the 
only individuals who can audit your financial statements.
 
Don’t be intimidated by CPAs because they have passed this tough exam. By 
all means, show some respect for their devotion to analyzing your financial 
situation, but do use their knowledge and ask them some questions about 
your affairs. That’s what you’re paying them for!
Picking your accounting method
Your accounting method determines when you record activities. Your 
accounting method answers this question: Do you record a transaction when 
it happens or when cash exchanges hands?
You have two choices:
 
✓ Cash basis: This method records transactions only when cash is 
received or paid. Bookkeepers use this method.
 
✓ Accrual basis: This method records revenues when they are earned, 
expenses when they are used, and purchases when they take place. 
Accountants use this method.
For example, if you ordered copy paper over the Internet for your office and 
charged it to your account, when does the transaction take place? Does it 
happen when you charge the purchase to your account? Or does it transpire 
when you pay the bill? If you were using the cash method, you’d record the 
transaction when the bill is paid. If you were using the accrual basis of 
accounting, you’d record the transaction right after charging the purchase to 
your account. Check out Chapter 2 for more in-depth discussion about these 
two methods and which one may be best for your nonprofit.

Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Understanding the basic terms
Before jumping into bookkeeping and accounting, make sure you understand 
some basic terminology. Throughout this book, I use the basic language 
the professionals use. That’s all you need to get a good grasp of processes 
and procedures. There’s no need to add another nerd to the accounting 
profession. Here I only share the need-to-know information.
Keep watch over your nonprofit’s finances
Sometimes nonprofit directors and managers 
feel they don’t have the knowledge to do their 
own books, so they turn everything over to a 
CPA. This book gives you the help you need to 
do some of your nonprofit’s basic bookkeeping 
and accounting. However, you may rightfully 
need a licensed professional to help with the 
more technical aspects of keeping your non-
profits books. That’s where a CPA can help. 
However, when using a CPA, don’t put all of 
your eggs in one basket. Although most CPAs 
are trustworthy and knowledgeable, I strongly 
suggest you keep some checks and balances in 
place to prevent any potential fraud. Checks 
and balances are periodic times when you sit 
down with your CPA for a layman’s analysis 
of what’s going on with your finances. You 
can also check for ways to improve your 
accounting procedures. (Check out Chapter 2 
for more info.)
Don’t become a victim by trusting a CPA to 
handle everything without asking questions. All 
too often, the media reports on an accountant 
or CPA embezzling funds from organizations. 
Oftentimes employers trust them because they 
don’t want the hassle of trying to understand 
the lingo. Therefore, many fall victim to situa-
tions that can be prevented. To avoid these 
problems, keep a close eye on your finances 
and ask your CPA questions. Also have some-
one in your office who works with the numbers 
so you’re not leaving everything up to your out-
side CPA.
For example, I received a call from a small boat-
ing company that had been taken for $80,000 by 
its accountant. The woman on the phone was 
hurt because the accountant had robbed the 
company of its entire savings. The accountant 
took care of everything — made all the pur-
chases, paid all the bills, wrote all the checks, 
balanced the books — and never missed a day 
of work.
This accountant also owned a check-cashing 
company. This allowed him to write checks to 
individuals and companies and cash them at his 
check-cashing store. This setup was a neat 
little scheme until the bottom fell out. One day 
the accountant took ill and couldn’t report to 
work for a week. The owners had to take care 
of the payroll and accounts payable. When they 
reviewed the books, they found out that they 
were flat broke.
The owners could have prevented this situation 
by not allowing the accountant to collect the 
money and pay the bills. They needed to find 
someone else to handle one of those tasks. This 
is called segregation of duties.

13
 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
To break down the accounting process, start with the basic accounting 
equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s equity
This equation needs to stay in balance. That’s why some call it double-entry 
accounting. (Check out Chapter 2 for more info on double-entry accounting.) 
What happens on one side must take place on the other in order for 
everything to stay in balance.
To help you understand how you can use this equation, I cover the accounts 
found on your statement of activities (the nonprofit term for what the for-
profit world calls the income statement) and your statement of financial 
position (the nonprofit term for the for-profit balance sheet). Walking through 
the equations used to complete these two statements gives you an accurate 
picture of your nonprofit’s financial situation. Knowing these two equations 
can make you a better decision maker and better financial manager by 
understanding how every transaction affects your financial statements.
 
✓ Statement of activities equation, also called the income statement 
equation: Revenues – Expenses = Income 
 
✓ Statement of financial position equation, also called the balance sheet 
equation: Assets – Liabilities = Equity or Assets = Liabilities + Equity 
(equity explains the difference between assets and liabilities)
 
 Your statement of financial position summarizes how financially stable 
your organization is and how solvent it is. A quick eye can look at this 
statement and gain great insight into your future to determine whether 
your organization can sustain the forces of the market. (Check out 
Chapter 16 for more about how this statement works.)
Assets, liabilities, and equity
Think of assets as something that you own or that adds value. Think of 
liabilities as something you owe or that takes away. Think of equity as the 
difference between the assets and liabilities.
An asset adds value, whether it’s monetary or not. Examples of assets are
 
✓ Accounts receivable
 
✓ Buildings
 
✓ Cash
 
✓ Equipment
 
✓ Furniture

14
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
 
✓ Homes
 
✓ Inventory
 
✓ Pledges receivable
 
✓ Prepaid expenses
 
✓ Property (land)
 
✓ Vehicles
A liability is something you owe or an obligation of time, money, or 
resources. Anything that must be paid is considered a liability. Some 
common liabilities are
 
✓ Accounts payables
 
✓ Accrued expenses
 
✓ Bills
 
✓ Car notes
 
✓ Mortgages
 
✓ Notes payable
 
✓ Short-term payables
 
✓ Utility bills
Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities. Equity is your net worth 
and is also referred to as net assets. When you have a list of all assets and all 
liabilities, you have everything needed to calculate your net worth. Net 
means the remainder after positive and negative amounts are combined.
Your goal at the end of the year is to have an increase in net assets and not a 
decrease in net assets. This means your net worth has increased.
Debits and credits
Accounting reflects what happens financially by increasing and decreasing 
accounts in the form of debits and credits. After you grasp the normal 
balances — what it takes to increase an account — for all accounts, you’ll 
know when to apply debits and credits.
Accounts are like coins in that they have two sides:
 
✓ The left side is the debit side of an account.
 
✓ The right side is the credit side of an account.

15
 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
Some people refer to this as T accounting because the record keeping is set 
up in the shape of a giant T. Imagine taking a piece of paper and drawing a 
horizontal line across the top and a vertical line down the middle. You’ve 
drawn a large T. On the left side of the vertical line you record debits, and on 
the right side is where credits go.
For example, take the statement of financial position with its assets and 
liabilities. Asset accounts normally have a debit balance, so the normal 
balance for assets accounts is a debit balance. Normal balance of any account 
is a positive amount or what is done to increase that account. So if you want 
to decrease an asset, you credit it. Asset accounts are debited for increases 
and credited for decreases. On the flipside, the normal balance for all liability 
accounts is a credit balance. To increase a liability account, you credit the 
account. To decrease a liability, you debit the account. Liability accounts are 
debited for decreases and credited for increases.
Debits and credits are done through double-entry accounting to keep your 
accounting equation in balance. Every transaction affects two or more items 
in your accounting equation. When you record entries in two or more places, 
you’re doing double-entry accounting.
Throughout your accounting period, you make debits and credits not only to 
your statement of financial position accounts, but also to your statement of 
activities accounts. Understanding how to increase and decrease these 
accounts is important.
 
✓ Revenue accounts are debited to decrease and credited to increase.
 
✓ Expense accounts are debited to increase and credited to decrease.
These mechanics are part of double-entry accounting, and the basis of every 
transaction is knowing what to do to increase and what to do to decrease an 
account. Check out Chapter 2 for more on double-entry accounting.
Adhering to GAAP
Before you can play a game, you read the instructions, right? Well before you 
can fully understand bookkeeping and accounting for your nonprofit, you 
have to familiarize yourself with the ground rules. The ground rules of the 
accounting profession can be attributed to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). GAAP are the standards that accountants follow when 
making decisions about how to handle accounting issues. Call them the rules 
of the profession.
GAAP were put in place to help accountants put their clients’ needs first 
and behave ethically. The idea is to make sure that your accountant treats 
you and your nonprofit’s business the same as he treats his other clients, 
and that all accountants are playing by the same rules. See Chapter 9 for 
more on GAAP.

16
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Keeping a paper trail
Leaving tracks in the sand is essential to proper management of your non-
profit’s books. You need documentation to prove why you did what you did. 
It adds credibility to your management of funds. Good housekeeping starts 
by keeping your checkbook register balanced (see Chapter 7) and continues 
with maintaining organized records (see Chapter 4).
It’s best to keep copies of where every donation comes from and how each 
dollar is spent. Part of being a good steward is leaving marks in the sand to 
account for your nonprofit activities.
 
Watch out for your debit cards issued by your bank. Transactions for these 
cards are so easy to forget to record in your checkbook register. They’re like 
the little foxes that catch you off guard.
Additionally, your auditor will want to backtrack in your steps to find the 
initial record that began a single transaction. Auditing is like looking for a 
needle in a haystack. Sometimes only your auditor knows what she’s looking 
for and why, but you have to let her look. Getting an audit of your financial 
statements is a necessary part of keeping your nonprofit status. Chapter 20 
tells you what to expect during an audit.
Auditing 101: It’s a GAAS!
In addition to playing by the rules when keeping your nonprofit’s books, 
you also need to follow other important rules concerning audits. Generally 
accepted auditing standards (GAAS) are rules or standards used to perform 
and report audit findings. Auditing is gathering and reviewing evidence about 
your organization to report on the degree between the way your nonprofit’s 
financial information is presented and the standards set by rule makers. The 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) sets the rules and 
requirements for audits, among other things.
Auditors give opinions by writing a report about your operating procedures, 
compliance with specific laws, and whether your financial statements are 
stated according to GAAP. As a nonprofit director or manager, you need to be 
concerned with three types of audits:
 
✓ An audit of financial statements, sometimes called an accounting audit, 
verifies whether statements have been prepared according to GAAP. 
Check out Chapter 20 for what happens during this type of audit.
 
✓ A compliance audit, sometimes referred to as a grant audit, reviews your 
financial records to determine whether your nonprofit is following 
specific procedures, rules, or regulations set down by some higher 
authority, like the IRS or some other government or rule-making body. 
See Chapters 9, 12, and 20 for more information about compliance.

17
 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
 
✓ An operational audit (also called the management audit or performance 
audit) measures and evaluates how efficiently you’re operating and 
how effectively you’re managing your nonprofit’s resources. Boards of 
directors often request this audit to evaluate organizational structure, 
computer operations, marketing, and so on.
Making Sure Your Books Are Balanced
Staying on top of your nonprofit’s financial activities is important because as 
the director, you can be held accountable. The way to start is making sure 
you have balanced books. Balanced books are up-to-date current information 
about your accounts. Every transaction that takes place affects two or 
more items in accounting, and you have to make sure everything stays in 
balance. Whether you create your own manual system or take advantage of 
the software on the market, you need to keep your books in order.
This section walks you through some basics to help you ensure your 
books are balanced. Follow the chapters in Part II for tools to assist you in 
maintaining balanced books.
Establishing a chart of accounts
Your chart of accounts is your blueprint for assigning numbers to specify 
accounts and having a method to track all accounts. By having a chart of 
accounts, you can recognize what type of account it is based on the begin-
ning number. For example, accounts beginning with 1 are usually assets 
accounts. After you get used to using the chart of accounts, you’ll enjoy the 
benefits of coding transactions according to their classification. Chapter 5 
has more on setting up your chart of accounts.
Tracking transactions
To have a firm grasp on your nonprofit’s financial status, your records 
have to be accurate. The only way to have accurate records is to record 
transactions when they take place.
Tracking your revenues and expenses is like in-house overdraft protection. 
It helps you know when you’re short on cash and when you’ve got plenty 
of money to pay the bills. For example, you know the feeling you get when 
someone doesn’t cash a check you’ve written? That outstanding check sort of 
bugs you and leaves you wondering if the check is lost. Then, one day after a 
few months, the check clears. Without a good tracking device or accounting 
system, you can easily lose track of your true checking account balance.

So how can you keep track of transactions? Don’t feel overwhelmed. You 
don’t need a PhD in aeronautical engineering. The following are a couple of 
easy ways to track them. Check out Chapters 6 and 7 for more on recording 
transactions and using a checkbook.
 
✓ Use online banking. Online banking gives up-to-date current balances 
anytime, day or night.
 
✓ Itemize your transactions when they happen. When you swipe your 
credit card or bank debit card, write it down right away in your 
checkbook register.
 
One of the most important things you need to keep track of is your donors list. 
A donors list includes contributors’ names, addresses, and phone numbers, as 
well as the donation dates. Your auditor will use this list to verify where the 
money came from and when.
Developing a budget
Your budget is your financial plan. It tells you how much money you have, 
how much you expect to receive, and how much you expect to spend. When 
you create a budget, you develop a formal plan for paying for your organiza-
tion’s future activities.
You not only need an operating budget for your organization, but you also 
need a separate budget for each and every program. Chapter 8 explains how 
to create a budget.
 
Always know how much money is needed to operate your nonprofit. If a 
private donor asks, you should know the exact amount needed to break even 
(the amount of money it takes to run all programs and pay all expenses 
within a given year).
Staying within the lines: Compliance
Only a few things can knock your nonprofit off the map. Not filing your paper-
work with the IRS, operating as a for-profit entity, and playing political games 
can throw you out of the nonprofit loop. As long as you operate according to 
your bylaws, stay out of political activities, and jump through all of the IRS’s 
hoops you’ll be in compliance.
In addition, you have to mind some accounting standards: generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), rules set by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB), and laws established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
(SOX). I explain the ins and outs of these guidelines in Chapter 9.

 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
You’re in the Money: The Lowdown 
on Federal Grants
Finding donations and revenue for your nonprofit may be frustrating at times. 
The good news: The federal government provides free money in the form of 
grants that you can apply for and not have to pay back. Grants come in all 
sizes, from preemies of $10,000 to supersizes of $1 million. And you don’t 
need to be an established nonprofit to apply for funding. Even if you’re small 
and new to the scene, you automatically qualify for a piece of the government 
grant pie. Take a slice and find viable solutions to your financial problems.
There is no way I would attempt to run a nonprofit without consulting with 
my rich Uncle Sam. Positioning your organization to receive grants requires 
four important things:
 
✓ Organization: You need to keep up with the paperwork involved to 
make the application and management process easier. I offer some steps 
in Chapter 10 that get you started in the right direction.
 
✓ Reading: In order to understand the dos and don’ts of how to put 
together your grant application, you need to carefully read all the paper-
work. When you discover how many grants are available for you, it’s 
gonna blow your mind.
 
✓ Writing: You need to put your plan on paper. Federal proposal writing is 
different from other writing you may do on a regular basis. I show you 
how to write about the facts and figures to prove your need, the steps to 
fulfill the need, the group of people who will carry out the plan, and how 
you will evaluate your results.
 
✓ Accountability: To fulfill reporting requirements, you need to be 
accountable. You successfully receive the grant; now you have to tell 
the government how you’re spending the grant money and how many 
folks are benefiting from the funds.
This section gives you a snapshot of the federal grant process. Chapters 11, 
12, and 13 provide an appetizing bite of what can become a buffet of federal 
money. Then you can stop worrying about how to fund your programs and 
focus on helping people.
Gleaning some grant basics
Grants are award instruments given by the federal government to implement 
programs that benefit people. You don’t have to pay grants back — they’re 
not loans. It’s free money! Figuring out the grant application process is easy, 
and the benefits of receiving a grant are phenomenal.

20
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Although many sources other than the federal government offer grants, I 
focus on Uncle Sam’s jackpot. Billions of dollars are available from 26 federal 
agencies to:
 
✓ Help nonprofits implement programs to benefit communities
 
✓ Do work that government can’t do
 
✓ Carry out a public purpose
Chapter 11 explores how grants can help your nonprofit’s bottom line.
Following the rules
When your nonprofit gets federal grant money, you’re not free to spend it as 
you wish. Grant money does have its red tape and paperwork, but you can’t 
afford to overlook the number-one grant maker in the nation (other than Bill 
Gates). The federal government is the perfect place to research and secure 
grant funding.
It’s a bit tricky to manage a grant, but after you get your first one behind you, 
managing others is like clockwork. Tick! Tock! Chapter 11 provides more 
insight to managing grant money.
 
The main challenge of managing a federal grant is submitting two reports in a 
timely manner. These reports tell the government
 
✓ What progress you’ve made toward your program goals to date
 
✓ How you’ve spent the federal money and how much is left
After you master the rules, you can play the grant game like a pro and 
become a grant guru.
Going through a grant audit
For many, the word audit brings to mind the freezing of assets and the 
endless search for paper trails that may lead to the discovery of something 
that wasn’t handled properly. For the record, an audit verifies and confirms 
the accuracy of your financial records and your compliance with the grant 
requirements.
The grant audit is usually conducted by someone from the granting agency. 
Your grant auditor checks out the federal government’s investment by seeing 
if you’re a good steward of grant dollars. Basically, the auditor wants to view 

21
 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
your accounting system to see how you separate your grant money from 
the rest of your money. Your auditor also looks at other areas, such as your 
organization’s travel, personnel, and purchasing policies and procedures. 
Don’t sweat it because I prepare you for the grant audit. I’ve been on both 
sides of the grant audit. I’ve audited others, and I’ve been audited. Chapter 12 
walks you through what to expect during a grant audit.
Paying Uncle Sam: Employee 
Payroll Taxes
Although your organization is a nonprofit and is exempt from paying federal 
taxes, don’t make this huge mistake: You’re still responsible for paying 
federal payroll taxes for all of your employees. Unfortunately you can’t avoid 
doing so (unless you want to end up in the clink for a while and have your 
nonprofit closed).
When you pay federal employee payroll taxes, usually on a quarterly basis, 
your payment consists of the employees’ FICA withholdings. These taxes 
are for Social Security and Medicare and are taken out of employees’ 
paychecks. Both Social Security and Medicare are financed primarily by 
employment taxes.
You are the steward of this money, and you need to submit it to the Social 
Security Administration and the IRS in a timely fashion. Hey, don’t worry 
too much about this one, because you can do it yourself and save your 
organization some money.
After you’ve walked through this process a couple of times, you’ll be able to 
calculate your payroll taxes yourself. Most payroll taxes are paid quarterly, 
and the feds will tell you when and how to pay. Chapter 13 gives you the 
lowdown on paying payroll taxes.
Getting a Grasp on Financial Statements
Financial statements are records of where your revenue comes from, where it 
goes, and where it is now. Your financial statements are important because 
they summarize your nonprofit’s activities for a specific time period, as of a 
certain date. Check out the chapters in Part IV for more in-depth explana-
tions on these statements and how you can create and use them to keep 
track of your organization’s finances.

22
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Your financial statements include
 
✓ Statement of activities: Also called the income statement, the statement 
of activities lists all revenues earned and all expenses paid for a time 
span of usually one year. It indicates whether your organization earned 
income by showing revenue collected, expenses incurred, and the 
difference between the two. The difference between revenue and 
expenses is net income or increases or decreases in equity or net assets. 
Refer to Chapter 15 for more info.
 
✓ Statement of financial position: Also referred to as the balance sheet, 
this statement reveals your solvency and stability by summarizing your 
assets (things you own) and liabilities (things you owe) and calculates 
your net worth, the difference between what you own and what you owe. 
Your statement of financial position reports your organization’s assets, 
liabilities, and equity as of a certain date. The difference between assets 
and liabilities equals your equity. Check out Chapter 16 for more.
 
✓ Cash flow statement: This statement evaluates all inflows and outflows 
of cash for the accounting period according to the activity. The cash 
flow statement breaks activities into three categories: operating, financ-
ing, and investing. See Chapter 17 for more on the cash flow statement.
 
✓ Statement of functional expense: This statement breaks down your 
expenses by category. The three categories of expense are program 
expenses, management and general expenses, and fundraising expenses. 
After you’ve completed the income statement, your statement of 
functional expense takes your total expenses from activities and 
divides them by their functions. See Chapter 18 for functional expense 
classifications.
Soliciting donors
In a class I took a few years back at Auburn 
University in Montgomery, Alabama, the teacher 
talked about soliciting gifts and how Ida Bell 
Young had left land and a tremendously large 
gift to AUM. The teacher explained how he had 
visited Mrs. Young on numerous occasions, and 
she had never indicated that she was going to 
give the university a dime.
Mrs. Young, like so many others, was looking 
for a worthy cause to leave her fortune to. 
As the executive director or manager of a 
nonprofit, you’re probably always looking for 
big donors like Mrs. Young. Soliciting a gift is a 
courtship, and you have to be persistent, 
patient, and exercise a lot of faith.

23
 Chapter 1: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofit Bookkeeping and Accounting
 
✓ Notes to the financial statements: The notes section tells the story 
behind the numbers. The notes describe your organization, explain 
your accounting methods, and explain any changes in those methods, 
potential lawsuits, or contingencies that threaten the livelihood of 
your existence. Plus they provide detailed information for some of the 
amounts in the financial statements.
 
 In addition, the notes clarify all restricted assets. In the notes you find 
pertinent information about bonds and notes payable. Anything that can 
have a material impact on your organization should be disclosed in the 
notes to the financial statements. See Chapter 19 to understand the 
importance of completing the notes to your financial statements.
Figuring Out Where Your Nonprofit Is: 
Five Important Questions
So many executive directors and managers of nonprofits live on the edge. 
Some stay up nights worrying about how they’re going to keep the lights 
on. Others wonder where they’re going to find funding to keep their pro-
grams running. Wouldn’t you like to relax a bit? Your relationship with your 
organization shouldn’t be like fighting with your spouse about money.
Don’t worry anymore. You don’t have to live in crisis mode any longer. Here I 
provide five common questions you may have and give you some answers to 
make your life a little easier.
 
✓ Why do I need a system to track and record revenues and expenses? 
You need to do so because you’re a good steward of the funds you 
manage, and you want to keep your supporters happy. A good steward 
is wise and prudent in the way he handles money. You first want to 
establish and then maintain a good reputation as being a good invest-
ment. You need a bookkeeping system that tracks and accounts for 
the funds you manage. Tracking and keeping up with the money that 
comes into your organization (revenues) and the money that goes 
out of your organization (expenses) makes you accountable and gives 
your nonprofit credibility.
 
✓ I need more stable sources of income to fund my programs. How do I 
go about finding those? I am glad you asked this question. Here is 
what you need to do. Get grant money! The most stable source of 
income for you is government grants. First do a little research. Then 
start reading. Now start writing. The final step is to manage your 
money. Don’t hesitate; get your piece of the American pie today. See 
Chapters 10 and 11 for actual steps to take and where to turn.

24
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
 
✓ What do I need to do with my records so I’m ready if I’m ever audited 
by the IRS? One thing I’ve noticed about the government is how much it 
loves documentation. Record and store for safe keeping the transactions 
you make. Leave a paper trail that leads to every purchase. In other 
words, keep copies of everything pertaining to income received, 
expenses paid, and assets purchased. In real estate, it’s all about loca-
tion, location, location. With the IRS, it’s document, document, and 
document. Chapter 4 can help you set up a record-keeping system.
 
✓ My money is unpredictable so why do I still need an operating 
budget? Whether you’re flat broke and don’t know where the next dime 
is coming from or have millions in the bank, you always need to have an 
operating budget. You need to know how much is needed to operate 
your organization on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. 
Your operating budget is your financial plan. Check out Chapter 8 for 
more advice.
 
✓ What do I need to know about complying with IRS guidelines to keep 
my nonprofit status? One thing that applies to all nonprofits, no matter 
how big or small, is filing information with the IRS annually through 
Form 990 or E-Postcard (Form 990-N). Which form you file depends on 
your annual gross receipts. Turn to Chapter 14 to find out more.

▶ Understanding your choices of accounting methods
▶ Taking steps to protect against employee theft
S
ometimes when I talk to computer support people over the phone about 
problems I’m having with my computers, they start using words like 
PPPoE, ISP, and a bunch of other stuff that I don’t have a clue about. When 
people talk over my head, my brain shuts down, and I can’t understand any-
thing. Every profession has its jargon, and accounting is no different. But the 
good news is that the jargon doesn’t have to be an impenetrable wall separat-
ing you from the bookkeeping and accounting tasks you need to master.
In this chapter, I introduce you to accounting (including basic terms) and explain 
why you need to understand it and how it works. I also get you started down 
the path of managing your nonprofit’s books — including deciding whether 
to handle the bookkeeping and/or accounting yourself or hire others to help 
you, selecting the most appropriate accounting methods for your organiza-
tion, safeguarding against tax audits, and protecting your nonprofit’s physical 
and financial assets from employee wrongdoing.
Understanding Bookkeeping 
and Accounting
Whether you’re chief executive officer of a multibillion dollar corporation or 
the manager of your household, you use accounting every day. To account is 
to record and report a quantity of money or objects. Accounting is counting, 

26
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
recording, classifying, and summarizing transactions, events, and things in 
terms of money — and then interpreting the results. If you look inside your 
wallet and count your money, you have accounted for how much you have.
Bookkeeping, on the other hand, is the process of accumulating, organizing, and 
storing information about transactions on a day-to-day basis. When you write a 
check and record it in your checkbook register, you engage in bookkeeping.
Accounting and bookkeeping have several things in common, but the most 
basic is transactions. A transaction is an exchange of value between two or 
more parties. For example, you walk into a local store and purchase a pack 
of gum, handing the cashier a $5 bill. When you get your change back, you 
count it to verify that it’s correct. Purchasing the gum is a transaction.
What’s the difference between 
bookkeeping and accounting?
Bookkeeping is the starting point of the accounting process, and it tracks 
the day-to-day operations of an organization. A bookkeeper does single-entry 
accounting, which means that she may only record a transaction in one place. 
This bookkeeping system operates on the cash basis (which I explain in the 
section “Keeping track of the cash” later in this chapter), and the only entry 
may be in the checkbook. Bookkeepers maintain the following documents:
 
✓ Copies of invoices and receipts
 
✓ Copies of checks and bank statements
 
✓ All other paperwork required for accounting purposes
Bookkeepers perform daily tasks of recording, including:
 
✓ Dates of transactions
 
✓ Amounts of transactions
 
✓ Sources of donations
 
✓ Expenses and loss transactions
Accounting summarizes the day-to-day activities recorded by a bookkeeper. 
Based on this information, an accountant prepares financial reports used to 
make decisions. An accountant uses double-entry accounting to record every 
transaction because every transaction affects a minimum of two accounts. 
For example, if you write a check for a printer, your bookkeeper will write the 
check and record it in the check register. Your accountant realizes that writ-
ing a check increases your assets and reduces your cash — that’s two things 
happening with one financial activity.

27
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
 
Accountants evaluate the overall results of economic activity by identifying, 
measuring, recording, interpreting, and communicating every transaction 
according to set rules and guidelines. They end the process by preparing 
financial statements that drive decision making within an organization.
Defining some common financial terms
Accounting is the language for business. As with all professions, it’s the 
jargon that complicates things. In the following sections, I define the most 
common accounting and bookkeeping terms. (As you read through the book, 
you’ll encounter many more accounting terms. I define those terms as you 
need to know them.)
Grasping assets, liabilities, and equity
I’ll bet you’ve heard the terms “asset,” “liability,” and “equity” before, espe-
cially if you’ve made any major purchases, like a house. Assets are what you 
own and include things like cars, buildings, savings, and other items of value. 
A house is considered an asset, even when you don’t yet own it outright.
Liabilities are what you owe, usually in the form of loan payments. Most 
people who say they’re homeowners really aren’t; as long as you’re paying on 
a mortgage, the payment is a liability due every month.
Equity (sometimes called net assets) is the difference between what you owe 
and what you own. In the case of a house, the equity is the value of the home 
minus the amount you still owe on the mortgage. In other words, assets 
minus liabilities equals equity.
Eyeing donation revenues, expenses, and nonprofit income
Revenue is the inflow of assets received in exchange for goods and services, 
or from donations, investments, and other miscellaneous sources. Donations 
will probably be your primary source of revenue. Donations come from indi-
viduals, corporations, foundations, and government entities to help you fulfill 
your mission. Cash, grants, time, and services are examples of donations.
Expenses are the cost for goods or services. Your nonprofit encounters the 
same expenses as most for-profit corporations, except for income taxes. You 
have to account for overhead expenses (rent, utilities, and so on), program 
management expenses (salaries, fringe benefits, and office supplies), and 
other incidentals.
Some people have a misconception that nonprofits shouldn’t make a profit or 
generate income, but no organization can operate without income. In the non-
profit arena, net income (revenues greater than expenses) increases net assets. 

28
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Thinking of a nonprofit in terms of break-even analysis, in which revenues equal 
expenses, is one way to understand the idea of a nonprofit acquiring income, 
and may motivate people to give to the organization.
Identifying cash flows and operating budgets
To stay afloat, you must identify new streams of cash flow to sustain your 
organization. Cash flow is the amount of money received in and paid out 
during a period of time. In the private sector, corporations are always looking 
for new ways to increase their cash flow, usually through new or improved 
products or services. (Think of how often the menu changes at fast-food res-
taurants!) As a nonprofit manager, you too must continuously look for new 
ways to appeal to your constituents and tap into new streams of cash flow. 
What you did last year may not appeal to them this year.
An operating budget is a financial plan with projections of what is expected 
and what is needed to operate. Even if you’re low on funds, you still need to 
calculate a goal of how much you need. Otherwise, how will you know when 
you’ve reached your goal?
Getting a hold on debits and credits
Debits and credits are what’s done to accounts to record transactions. To get 
a grasp on debits and credits, you must first know the normal balances of a 
few accounts. The normal balance is what it takes to increase an account.
Think of this as an equation that has two sides, a right side and a left side. 
What is done on the right must be balanced by recording the same amount 
on the left. For example, to debit an account is to charge the left side or left 
column of your journal or ledger. (A journal is a book of original entry where 
transactions are recorded in the order they occur; a ledger contains the 
transactions according to the account they belong to. Check out Chapter 6 
for more info.) Asset and expense accounts are increased by debits. On the 
other hand, to credit an account is always done to the right side or right 
column of your journal or ledger. Revenue, liability, and equity accounts are 
increased by credits.
Asset accounts normally have a debit balance, so if you debit an asset 
account, you increase it. This transaction is placed on the left side of the 
journal or ledger. If you credit an asset account, you decrease it. Credits are 
shown on the right side of a journal or ledger.

29
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
Asset accounts can be current or long term and include the following 
accounts: land, building, equipment, accumulated depreciation, cash, grants 
and accounts receivables, nonprofit inventory, prepaid rent, prepaid insur-
ance, and supplies on hand.
Liability accounts normally have a credit balance, so if you credit a liability 
account, you increase it. If you debit a liability account, you decrease it. As 
with assets, debits are recorded on the left side or column of the journal 
or ledger, and credits are recorded on the right side or column. In fact, this 
holds true for all accounting processes.

To decrease an account, you need to do the opposite of what is done to 
increase it.
Equity is handled the same as liability accounts. If you credit equity, you 
increase it. If you debit equity, you decrease it.

Finding the Right People to Manage 
the Books and Monitor the Finances
Deciding whether to hire outside help to track your nonprofit’s accounts or 
do it yourself is something that only you can decide. If you’re busy with other 
things and it’s within your budget to hire someone to do the job, then hire 
someone else to do it. This outside help can take a number of different forms, 
which I cover in this section. Of course, both options have advantages and 
disadvantages.
One advantage to hiring outside help is you get to delegate, which frees you 
up to do other things. Another upside is that you get an expert to manage 
your books and keep you on track. But the downside is that hiring someone 
to manage your books may cost you more than it would to pay someone 

30
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
on staff to handle the chore. You’ll need to hire a reliable company, which 
may be expensive, or you can find a consultant, who may charge a bit more 
because he has to pay his own taxes.
Regardless of whether you or someone in your organization takes on your 
organization’s bookkeeping and accounting or you hire outside help, you 
need to know some accounting. Also, you need to understand the basic 
principles accountants use when making decisions about how to record 
transactions. That’s what the majority of this book helps you with. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain who can do what when it comes to your nonprofit’s 
finances.
Considering a bookkeeper 
or an accountant
Bookkeepers handle the day-to-day finances of your organization. There’s no 
educational or training requirement to become a bookkeeper, but a person 
should be able to do basic math and be comfortable operating a 10-key 
adding machine. A bookkeeper passes the day-to-day transaction information 
on to the accountant. (See the “What’s the difference between bookkeeping 
and accounting?” section for more on the specific duties of these positions.)
Accountants are required to have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree to per-
form their duties and fully understand the accounting process. An accoun-
tant can perform the functions of a bookkeeper, but an accountant also looks 
at the big picture of your organization’s finances and prepares the financial 
statements that help you determine whether you’re on the right track or 
need to make some adjustments.
Accountants who pass the uniform Certified Public Accountants exam are 
called CPAs. CPAs are the only ones authorized to do a financial audit of 
your accounting records according to generally accepted auditing standards 
(GAAS). An audit is an examination of your accounting records and financial 
statements that determines whether your records fairly represent your finan-
cial position according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
GAAP are the legal standards for measuring and reporting financial transac-
tions that are the source of information used to prepare financial statements.
 
Since the Enron scandal in the early 2000s, organizations of all kinds must be 
aware of their CPA’s activities and not necessarily sit back and trust their CPA 
to do the right thing. I’m not saying not to trust your CPA, but you shouldn’t 
just take her word for everything. To protect your organization’s finances, 
make sure you understand the basics outlined in this book.

31
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
 
Hiring a bookkeeper to record transactions and keeping a CPA on retainer can 
save you some money in the long run. A bookkeeper who communicates with 
a CPA makes the job easier for both. Plus, bookkeepers come a lot cheaper 
than accountants. Why pay an accountant’s fees for a bookkeeper’s task?
Doing it yourself
If your background isn’t in accounting and you want to keep track of the day-
to-day bookkeeping operations of your nonprofit, you can do most of the 
work yourself. If you opt to do it yourself, I hope you’re a stickler for details. 
It helps if you’re organized, too. You can figure out how to do this stuff if 
you’re disciplined and use the information in this book. In the beginning, it 
may take a little longer to do a task because it will be new to you, but once 
you get it, you’ve got it.
 
However, one thing you can’t do yourself is an independent audit of your own 
records. Well, you can audit your internal records, but performing the overall 
audit of financial statements doesn’t give them an outsider’s verification. An 
independent audit lends credibility to your organization based on the review 
of an outside CPA. Only a professional can offer such an opinion about your 
financial health.
 
GAAS state that only CPAs can perform an audit that provides an opinion on 
your financial statements. In addition, your auditor must be independent. The 
guidelines also recommend that you put your audit out to bid every three to 
five years or so.
Opting for a fiscal sponsor or agent
A fiscal sponsor or agent is a nonprofit organization that helps a smaller non-
profit by taking care of its financial responsibilities and allowing the smaller 
nonprofit to use the larger one’s nonprofit status to get grants. Think of 
having a fiscal sponsor or agent as falling under someone’s umbrella.
Usually your fiscal agent is an organization that
 
✓ Shares a similar mission as yours
 
✓ Has an accounting staff
 
✓ Has a proven track record of accomplishments
 
✓ Has years of experience

32
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
What type of relationship you have with your fiscal agent varies. Your fiscal 
agent may handle all of your money or just your grant money. You may 
approve the day-to-day transactions of your nonprofit and/or pass your bills 
and invoices on to your fiscal agent for processing and payment. Some fiscal 
agents process all payments and invoices as well as prepare financial status 
reports for your grants.
It all depends on your arrangement with your fiscal agent. Some fiscal agents 
receive an administrative fee of 5 percent or more for taking care of your 
accounting and reporting requirements. Some fiscal agents don’t charge any-
thing for the services they provide.
To qualify for most government and foundation grants, an organization must 
hold the IRS 501(c)(3) status of a nonprofit charitable organization. Some 
new organizations that haven’t received their nonprofit status get a fiscal 
agent with 501(c)(3) status to help them qualify for grants until they receive 
their own nonprofit status.
 
If your organization is small, relatively new to the nonprofit scene (less than 3 
years old), and needs someone to take care of its financial responsibilities, 
then finding a fiscal agent may be for you. To find a fiscal agent, contact
 
✓ Your state nonprofit resource center
 
✓ The community foundation in your area
 
✓ Your local United Way
Outsourcing the job
To outsource a job means to shift the responsibilities to someone outside 
your organization. There are some advantages and disadvantages to out-
sourcing work:
 
✓ Advantages: You don’t have to pay payroll taxes or benefits for the 
employee, and if you’re not satisfied with the services, you can always 
terminate the contract. You also use them on an as-needed basis.
 
✓ Disadvantages: You may not be able to terminate your contract if the 
contractor falls short on his duties. Most outsourcing arrangements 
involve contractual agreements for a certain amount of time for a set fee. 
Also, you may have to pay higher fees to the consultant, and you have 
limited control over the contractor.
You can outsource computer services, bookkeeping, accounting, grant writ-
ing, auditing, and legal services by hiring consultants in these areas.

When looking for people to outsource to it’s best to get referrals from your 
peers. You can thumb through the phone book, do a search on the Internet, or 
run an ad in the newspaper, but referrals are best. Even if you outsource your 
accounting services, you still need to know and understand the basic steps of 
the accounting process. It’s impossible to manage an organization without 
understanding the consequences of your financial actions.
Hiring an independent auditor
Hiring an independent auditor to audit your financial statement is a must if 
you want to qualify for government grants and lend credibility to your orga-
nization’s financial statements. According to GAAS, all nonprofit financial 
statements must be audited by an outside independent auditor. Some states 
require nonprofits with a certain annual income to have their books audited. 
Plus, your board may want your books examined by an outside auditor.
Picking an auditor to give you a valid independent audit doesn’t have to be a 
grueling process. Your board selects a committee to take care of this for you. 
Only a CPA can offer a professional opinion about your financial statements. 
Of course, you also can have your statements compiled and reviewed for in-
house purposes, such as for staff and board meetings. Turn to Chapter 20 for 
what you need to know about having your financial statements audited.
Choosing Your Accounting Method
Before starting to keep track of things, you need to decide which of two meth-
ods you’ll use to account for your activities. Will you use the cash basis or 
the accrual basis of accounting?
When you choose the cash basis, transactions are recorded only when cash 
changes hands, not when a purchase is made. When you make a purchase, 
you have several ways you can pay. Suppose, for example, you run to your 
nearest office supply store to stock up on pencils, paper, staples, sticky 
notes, and whatever other fun items you run across. You can pay for these 
goodies either with cash or a credit card, or you can have the goods charged 
to your account, which you will pay later. If you pay with cash or a credit 
card, the transaction shows up in your books immediately. Note: Although 
using a credit card is a cash transaction, you treat it as a payable transaction 
for simplicity and then adjust it at the end of the year. When you pay by writ-
ing a check, that’s considered a cash transaction.
If you decide to charge the same stuff to your account, under the cash basis, 
you don’t indicate the transaction until the bill is paid. If you’re using the 
accrual basis of accounting, transactions are treated the same, no matter how 

34
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
they’re paid for. You record transactions at the moment a purchase is made, 
whether you pay for it or charge it. So if you buy those nifty office supplies 
on credit and pay the bill four weeks later, the transaction is recorded when 
you bought the supplies.
You can choose to keep your accounting records on a cash or accrual basis, 
but your financial statements should be prepared using the accrual basis of 
accounting. The major difference between cash and accrual basis has to do 
with when transactions are recorded.
Keeping track of the cash
Cash is a medium of exchange. Cash is currency, and in accounting, cash is a 
current asset. Cash equivalents are instruments that can be immediately con-
verted into cash and include
 
✓ Petty cash, usually kept to make small office purchases
 
✓ Checking account balances
 
✓ Certificates of deposits (CDs)
 
✓ Savings account balances
Recording transactions using the cash method means that you record rev-
enues only when cash is received and record expenses only when they’re 
paid. This is the easiest method to use because if you make a purchase on 
account, and the bill doesn’t come out until next month, you don’t record 
the transaction until you pay the bill. A bookkeeper may only know how to 
account for transactions using the cash method.
 
When preparing your organization’s financial statements, a CPA can easily 
convert your cash basis accounting information into GAAP-required accrual 
basis information.
Accrual basis of accounting
The accrual basis of accounting dictates when revenues and expenses should 
be recorded on the books. To accrue means to accumulate or increase. Under 
the cash method, you record revenues and expenses at the moment cash 
exchanges hand. Under the accrual basis, revenues and expenses are recog-
nized when a transaction takes place, whether cash exchanges hands or not.
For example, if you buy office supplies on account, you record the transac-
tion in your accounting books when you make the purchase and again when 
the bill is paid. To record such a transaction, you debit your supplies and 

35
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
credit accounts payable for the cost of the office supplies. When the bill is 
paid, you debit accounts payables and credit cash.
 
The accrual basis gives you a more accurate account of what is owed at any 
given time. It also requires end-of-the-period adjustments for salaries and 
other expenses. Keep in mind, your accounting period may close, but you may 
have some expenses, such as prepaid subscriptions, prepaid insurance, or sal-
aries, that cross more than one period. The accrual basis of accounting 
charges expenses to the period they are used.
Running Numbers on Your Assets
When you buy items such as printers, computers, cars, or other stuff that 
lasts more than a year, you need to place these items on your books as assets. 
To record an asset, you record it in your books at the price you paid for it.
Because some assets, such as computers, may last for several years, you 
need to write off the cost (depreciate) over the item’s lifespan. For example, 
if a computer is expected to last three years, you’ll need to depreciate it over 
three years. Depreciable assets are commonly referred to as plant, property, 
and equipment (PPE). The following sections explain how to put a number to 
your assets and how to depreciate them.
 
When writing off the cost of assets, you never depreciate the cost of land. You 
need to depreciate the costs of all other assets classified as PPE that last longer 
than a year.
Evaluating assets by original 
cost or fair market value
Prices fluctuate just like the wind. You may pay $1,000 for something on 
Tuesday and then discover that it went on sale the next day for $500. When 
this happens, how much is the item worth? What amount should you record 
in your books? Maybe you should return the item, get a refund, and buy it 
again.
Don’t go to any extra trouble because the answer is simple. All assets should 
be recorded at their purchased price. Think about this for a moment. If you 
purchased the item on Wednesday, it would be recorded on your books for 
$500; but if you bought the item on Tuesday, it would be recorded in the 
books at $1,000.

36
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
An original cost is the purchase price paid for an asset. Historical cost is 
also referred to as original cost, and it’s an approach that keeps assets on 
the books at their purchased price with no regard for inflation or the 
economy.
If all assets are recorded on the books at their original cost, then unless an 
item depreciates, your books reflect your historic values. However, values 
can change due to market conditions or from an assets use. Accountants 
have been debating about recording assets at their original cost or market 
value for years. I don’t expect the debate to stop anytime soon.
Presently, GAAP requires depreciable assets to be recorded at historic value. 
Depreciation is used to reduce an asset’s value due to the asset’s use over 
time. You can’t take any additional adjustments for estimated changes in the 
asset’s market value because market values for depreciable assets are only 
estimates. They aren’t used to avoid the possibility of someone using the 
information to manipulate reported financial results.
In contrast to historical cost, fair market value is the price that an interested 
buyer would be willing to pay and an interested seller would be willing to 
accept for a particular asset. If you had to liquidate all of your assets tomor-
row, then fair market value would be very important to you.
You record investments (marketable securities) at fair market value and 
adjust for changes in their value. These adjustments affect income. In this 
instance, market values aren’t estimates; they’re readily determined, and so 
there is no room to manipulate financial results.
Grasping depreciation methods
To depreciate means to write off the expense of an item over its expected 
useful life, less any salvage value (the amount that can be recovered after an 
asset’s service life). When you purchase equipment or a building, you pay a 
set amount. As time passes, these assets lose some of their value. Accounting 
allows you to write off a portion of the cost by depreciating it as an expense. 
For example, suppose you buy a building for $450,000, and the building is 
expected to be useful to you for ten years, at which time its salvage value will 
be $50,000. You have $400,000 of depreciation expense to write off for the 
building over those ten years.
You get to choose which method you use to write off the cost of the build-
ing. The amount of depreciation expense you get to write off in any year 
depends on which depreciation method you choose. Because depreciation 
is an expense that’s subtracted from revenue, it directly affects your 
bottom line.

37
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
The executive director and board, with the advice of an accountant, decide 
which depreciation method to use. You can use a different method for different 
assets. The most important thing to remember here is that you want to reflect 
the most accurate value of all of your assets. It’s important for you to know the 
value of the assets you own.
In all that you do, you want to fairly present your financial information in the 
most accurate way. Some financial types have started discussing how assets 
are valued on the books compared to their market value. Some organizations 
have assets that are overvalued on their books, and then when those assets 
are evaluated, the previous value that has been indicated on the organiza-
tion’s statement of financial position isn’t correct.
 
I suggest for most things that you use the straight-line method of depreciation 
because it equally writes off the cost over the years. For some assets, such as 
computers or cars, you may want to use an accelerated method to accurately 
reflect the asset’s true value. You know how you’ve heard that the value of a 
new car depreciates the minute you drive it off the lot? Well, the same is true 
with computers because new technology is being invented all the time. (Keep 
reading to understand the differences between different depreciation methods.)
 
Employ the consistency principle by choosing a depreciation method and then 
being consistent with its use. This doesn’t mean that you can never change 
from one accounting method to another. When you change methods, you need 
to disclose and explain the nature of the change and the effects on income in 
the notes to the financial statements.
Choosing declining depreciation
Declining depreciation, also called accelerated depreciation, is any method 
that writes off larger amounts of depreciation expense in the early years of an 
asset’s life and smaller amounts in the later years. Declining depreciation can 
be used on any item classified as plant, property, or equipment (PPE).
When to use this type of depreciation method depends on the use and life of 
the asset. Assets with shorter lives (less than ten years) usually lose most 
of their value in their earlier years, so declining depreciation methods are 
warranted. Longer lived assets tend to lose their value evenly over time, and 
straight-line depreciation is adequate for these assets (see the next section). 
Although the IRS and GAAP offer some guidance, use your professional judg-
ment or solicit the advice of an accountant or CPA.
For tax purposes, the IRS has a declining depreciation system that provides 
useful lives for classes of assets and tables of depreciation percentages for 
various depreciation methods and asset lives. Computer software generally 
has a useful life of three years, most automobiles have a useful life of three to 
five years, other furnishings and equipment have useful lives of seven years, 
and you can depreciate a building over 39 years. The IRS system doesn’t take 

38
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
salvage value into account, but the tables are useful and can be applied to 
amounts adjusted for salvage value. IRS Publication 946, How to Depreciate 
Property, is a good source of information about depreciation methods. You 
can find the publication online at www.irs.gov/publications/p946/
index.html.
Going with straight-line
The most widely used method of depreciation is the straight-line method. 
The straight-line depreciation method allocates the same amount of deprecia-
tion for each year over the expected life of an asset.
 
When in doubt about which method to use, choose the straight-line method 
because it’s the most conservative approach. The equation for the straight-
line depreciation method is
(Cost – Residual value) ÷ Useful life
 
Residual value is the same as salvage value. It’s the value placed on an asset 
after it’s fully depreciated. For example, suppose you expect to use your com-
puter system for three years, and you pay $30,000 with an expected salvage 
value of $3,000. Plug these numbers into the equation, and your depreciation 
expense using the straight-line method is $9,000 per year.
($30,000 – $3,000) ÷ 3 years = $9,000 depreciation per year for 3 years
Selecting double-declining balance
In a nutshell, the double-declining balance depreciation method is twice the 
rate of straight-line. The major difference between the double-declining bal-
ance and the straight-line method of depreciation is the amount of deprecia-
tion in each year of an asset’s useful life. With double-declining balance, as 
opposed to straight-line, more depreciation is expensed in an asset’s early 
years, and less is expensed in its later years.
 
Use the double-declining balance when depreciating assets that depreciate at 
an accelerated rate. For example, computer equipment depreciates faster than 
you can take it out of the box, so this is the perfect type of asset to apply the 
double-declining method to.
To calculate the double-declining balance method, you must first compute 
the rate of depreciation for the straight-line method. Then double this rate. 
You don’t deduct the salvage value from the original cost of the asset when 
computing the asset’s depreciable base. However, you stop taking deprecia-
tion expense when the asset’s net book value (original cost less accumulated 
depreciation) reaches the asset’s salvage value. GAAP doesn’t allow a depre-
ciable asset’s net book value to be less than its salvage value.

39
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
Returning to the example from the previous section, suppose your computer 
system has a total cost of $30,000, a salvage value of $3,000, and is expected 
to last three years. Figure 2-1 shows a comparison of the straight-line and 
double-declining balance depreciation methods.

Keeping an Eye on Your Assets
It’s virtually impossible to know if an employee will steal. You can do a back-
ground check on potential employees and give them assessment exams to find 
out what type of person they really are. Some of the major retailers ask a series 
of questions that gives them a good indication of a person’s moral character. 
You can order or design a similar test for your staff. Also, you can install secu-
rity cameras in your building that record everything that takes place.
In addition to implementing protective procedures regarding whom your 
nonprofit organization hires, you can institute internal controls that directly 
monitor your organization’s financial holdings. A good system of internal 
controls puts some checks and balances in place to protect against employee 
theft. The following sections give you some ideas about how to keep your 
assets safe.

40
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
 
The next time you’re ready to hire an employee, perform a background check 
on her. You can even get the potential employee to pay for the background 
check. Oftentimes this can be done through your state’s attorney general’s 
office or other law enforcement agencies.
Protecting your nonprofit’s physical assets
Tracking and keeping up with inventory is a must to protect your nonprofit’s 
assets. Portable equipment like a laptop computer is so easy to walk away 
with. To safeguard your valuables, require all equipment to be checked out 
before leaving the building. Furthermore, some organizations have their 
employees sign statements agreeing to have their final paychecks withheld 
until all equipment is returned in good condition.
 
Limiting access to certain areas of interest can protect your assets. Consider 
installing security cameras and key access cards, as well as keeping your petty 
cash drawer locked and a book handy to record all transactions with receipts 
to support them.
Setting internal controls 
Internal controls are procedures and policies that you establish to limit the 
possibility of accounting errors, fraud, theft, or embezzlement (taking some-
thing of value from someone who trusts you).
Keeping some office doors locked and areas off limits is just one kind of inter-
nal control to protect important records and data from manipulation. Other 
internal controls are less obvious than locked doors.
Establishing checks and balances
The founding fathers of the United States knew that human nature is subject 
to error, and they established the system of checks and balances to provide 
constant oversight and accountability within the federal government. You 
can apply a similar system of internal control by which you have checkpoints 
to balance your books. For example, some organizations do a physical count 
of all inventories to see if anything is missing or unaccounted for.
Checks and balances in your organization not only can help you avoid an 
audit finding but also can protect your assets. Start with the following checks 

41
 Chapter 2: Starting with Basic Bookkeeping and Accounting
and balances and then expand upon them for protections that are even more 
specific to your organization and its operations:
 
✓ Require two signatures on all checks over a set amount (usually more 
than a typical payroll tax deposit amount)
 
✓ Separate duties between your record keeper and the person handling 
cash
 
✓ Record employees’ hours daily on timesheets
 
✓ Require all invoices for payment to be reviewed and authorized
 
Your nonprofit’s policies and procedures manual should present and explain 
your organization’s checks and balances in such a way that all the steps are 
clearly defined. Most nonprofits have written policies about personnel, travel, 
and purchasing procedures. Put steps in writing about how to deal with per-
sonnel matters. Include the limits on travel pay for mileage, lodging, and so 
forth. Also, create rules to deal with large purchases of, say, more than $500. 
You need to have a plan for how these types of situations should be handled 
to bring structure to your organization.
Separating employees duties
You can place some roadblocks in your accounting system that prevent employ-
ees from stealing from your nonprofit (or at the very least, make it really hard). 
You can establish segregation of duties, which is a type of internal control. 
Segregation of duties assigns different steps of a process to different people. 
So, for example, you don’t allow the same person who opens the mail to be 
responsible for making deposits. Think about how easy it would be for the 
person opening the mail to borrow cash payments.
Following are some examples of segregation of duties that you can apply to 
your nonprofit:
 
✓ Accounts payable and receivable: The person approving payments 
shouldn’t be authorized to make purchases without some oversight by 
a second party. If yours is a large organization, your accounts payable 
office should be a separate entity from the accounts receivable unit.
 
✓ Business mail and check deposits: One person can open business 
mail and log in each check that’s received, but someone else should be 
responsible for making deposits into your bank account.
 
Auditors write up many smaller nonprofits not because anything is wrong with 
their books but because they don’t have adequate logical segregation of staff 
duties.

42
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Insuring or bonding nonprofit employees
Checks and balances and segregation of duties establish some internal controls 
(refer to the preceding sections), but you can take your internal protections a 
step further with risk-management strategies. Insuring or bonding your nonprofit 
employees ensures that your nonprofit organization faces minimal risk of loss in 
case of mistakes or malfeasance by the people who manage your organization.
A bond is a debt security that guarantees to pay you for acts committed by 
board members or employees, and it protects you from employee or board 
theft. A bond is actually paid to you by the bonding company, but the person 
bonded reimburses the bonding company. Any reputable bonding entity will 
share some helpful tips about bonding your employees.
You determine the type and degree of insurance and bonded protections 
your nonprofit needs based on an assessment of your organization. First, you 
need to evaluate the potential risk and think about how much money is being 
handled. What is the value of what you own? How much equity do you have 
in your organization? How much money do you have in your savings and 
checking accounts? These are some of the questions you’ll need to answer to 
determine how much insurance is needed. For example, your donors list is a 
valuable asset that you must safeguard (turn to Chapter 7 for an explanation 
of donors lists). You can protect your donors list by respecting those indi-
viduals who don’t want to be disclosed to the general public. Your donors list 
should never be sold to another organization to solicit funds.
Do some research by consulting with a few insurance companies and com-
paring rates. Your board of directors is responsible for finding an insurance 
company and approving the purchase of bonding insurance. As with most 
things concerning the management of your nonprofit, your board is respon-
sible for making key decisions.

▶ Identifying external and internal users
▶ Viewing a snapshot of nonprofit statements
I
f you’ve ever made a major purchase or tried to secure a large sum of 
money to purchase a home, the lending institution, mortgage company, or 
bank probably asked for personal financial information about what you earn 
(income), what you own (assets), and what you owe (liabilities). In essence, 
the lender wanted to know your true financial position. Although this exam-
ple is on a personal level, for-profit businesses and nonprofit organizations 
need to access the same information in the form of financial statements.
Nonprofit organizations have similar financial transactions and needs as 
for-profit businesses. Financial statements describe and summarize operat-
ing activities, obligations, and economic resources for a given period, usu-
ally one year. A wide assortment of individuals and entities evaluate these 
statements to get a clear picture of your nonprofit’s true financial position. 
Donors, investors, and creditors evaluate these reports when they’re decid-
ing whether to donate or lend money to your organization.
This chapter gives you a quick overview on why these financial statements 
are important and which statements your nonprofit needs to use. The chap-
ters in Part IV then delve deeper into these statements and show you how 
your nonprofit can use them.
The Lowdown on Financial Statements: 
Why They’re Important
Nonprofits are granted tax-exempt status by the government to enable organi-
zations to provide services in the public’s interest. In exchange for tax-exempt 
status (owing no federal corporate income taxes), these organizations are 

44
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
expected and required to perform and record financial functions in an effec-
tive, efficient manner. (See more about tax-exempt status in Chapter 14.)
Your nonprofit doesn’t pay corporate taxes, but you’re required to submit 
information to the IRS about your activities — annually. Your nonprofit will 
file a Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, that tells 
where your money came from, who you paid, and how much you paid. Don’t 
worry; no money is due, just information. You need to file this information 
every year by the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of a tax-exempt 
organization’s fiscal year. For a calendar year, the deadline is May 15. (Refer 
to Chapter 14 for more info about Form 990.)
Not only is Big Brother watching over your shoulder, but the public has 
your organization under close watch because, in essence, the public is your 
employer. The very reason for a nonprofit’s existence — to serve the public’s 
interest — opens up financial information for public review. Therefore, your 
financial records are considered public domain. Because every move you 
make and every transaction you record are subject to public scrutiny, prop-
erly tracking every transaction by recording and keeping adequate books is 
essential.
If you want continued support from the public, then disclosing and reporting 
your organization’s operating activities, economic resources, and obligations 
are in your best interest. Not only is it in your best interest, but it’s required 
by law via a tax return.
A complete set of financial statements for nonprofit organizations includes 
the following:
 
✓ Independent auditor’s report (see Chapter 20 for more info)
 
✓ Statement of activities, also called the income statement
 
✓ Statement of financial position, also referred to as the balance sheet
 
✓ Cash flow statement
 
✓ Statement of functional expenses
 
✓ Notes to financial statements
I explain each of these reports in more detail in this chapter.
When you have a small block of time, log on to www.guidestar.org and 
look up your favorite (or your own) nonprofit organization. You can find out 
where its money came from, who it paid, and how much. All Form 990s are 
open for public review.

45
 Chapter 3: Introducing Financial Statements
In the following sections I give a brief overview of how you can use these 
statements to benefit and sustain your nonprofit. Tracking your income and 
spending helps you stay on track financially. Doing so is essential for you to 
know where your nonprofit’s money comes from and where it goes.
Seeing the benefits of tracking the money
Financial statements summarize and describe nonprofit activity over a period 
of time. They should show that you have fulfilled your end of the bargain in 
being held accountable. They also indicate whether you’ve been a respon-
sible steward or sloppy manager of nonprofit resources.
 
Sloppy management or inadequate accounting records can prove detrimental 
to your organization’s reputation. The bulk of your support comes from con-
tributions made by private donors, government entities, foundations, and cor-
porate givers. If they see that you haven’t been responsible with their money, 
they’re likely to stop supporting you.
These statements also serve folks within the organization. People within your 
nonprofit use these financial statements to forecast the organization’s needs 
and create plans to address those needs.
Who uses these statements
Without financial statements, planning and forecasting your organization’s 
future needs is nearly impossible. Internal and external users rely on a 
nonprofit organization’s financial statements to make important decisions. 
Managers of nonprofit organizations use financial statements to make deci-
sions concerning the organization. People outside of the nonprofit use the 
documents to decide whether to make a donation. I go into more specifics 
about these uses in the following sections.
Internal users
The following individuals are examples of internal users of nonprofit financial 
statements:
 
✓ Executive director: This person is hired by the board of directors to 
preside over the day-to-day management of a nonprofit. She uses finan-
cial statements to see the big picture of the organization’s finances.
 
✓ Nonprofit executive manager: This person oversees accounting, infor-
mation systems, marketing, personnel, and fundraising. He is likely to 
follow the organization’s finances more closely.

46
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
 
✓ Nonprofit accountant: He tracks and accounts for your financial activi-
ties. His work forms the basis of your financial statements.
 
✓ Board members: These folks are responsible for oversight of the entire 
operation. They use your financial statements to make sure the non-
profit is headed in the right direction.
 
Internal users have a greater need than external users do to review financial 
statements. Internal users must compare actual versus budget data on a 
month-by-month basis. Actual refers to results that have happened, and budget 
refers to anticipated results. A budget is a projection. It predicts future antici-
pated revenues and expenses that may change. Past financial information can 
be a good gauge of future revenues. (Check out Chapter 8 for more info on 
projecting a budget.)
Board members and executive directors rely on financial statements to guide 
their decision making. These reports tell how much money the organization 
received in the past year and how much it spent. They also reveal whether an 
organization can pay its debt. For example, the last figure on the statement of 
activities is either a positive or a negative number. This number reveals how 
well the organization performed financially over the last year. Information 
like this helps executive directors and board members do financial forecast-
ing. Information from current statements can be compared to prior years.
External users
External users also rely on your nonprofit’s financial statements. Those exter-
nal users are
 
✓ Bankers/creditors: The first statement your banker will want to see is 
the statement of financial position. Just like all creditors, your banker 
wants to know if you have something of value to secure a loan.
 
✓ Public donors: They are public charities and government entities.
 
✓ Private donors: They are individuals, corporations, and private founda-
tions that donate to your organization. They invest in your cause.
 
✓ Independent auditors: Your independent auditor needs copies of your 
financial statements to verify the fairness of representation of your 
finances. External auditors use financial statements from prior years 
to detect significant change. If a significant change is noticed, then 
you’re required to explain. For example, if you have a large decrease or 
increase in cash without a clear explanation, then a red flag is raised. 
(See Chapter 20 for more about audits.)
 
✓ Public watchdog groups: These groups keep an eye on nonprofits. Their 
underlying motive is to expose your nonprofit to the general public as 
being a fraud or counterfeit if you’re not being a good steward and doing 

47
 Chapter 3: Introducing Financial Statements
what you’re supposed to be doing. Public watchdogs go to extreme mea-
sures to expose you if you’re not doing the right thing. After the media 
gets wind that you may not be doing what you should be doing with the 
money, you may be tried in public.
Using Financial Statements 
to Your Advantage
Have you heard the phrase, “Everyone has to answer to someone”? Well, this 
is true for nonprofits too. Life would be easier if nonprofits could just focus 
on the people and causes they help and not have to worry about finances, 
but this isn’t the case. Call financial statements your financial scorecards; if 
you don’t keep score, someone else will tally it for you.
The quickest way to identify problems in an organization is to read the finan-
cial statements and notes to the financial statements. They can help manag-
ers identify and correct potential problems, and they can reveal to external 
users whether your nonprofit uses its funds responsibly. The statements 
should be accurate, easily readable, understandable, and done in a timely 
fashion.
 
The headings on all financial statements answer the who, what, and when. The 
who is the name of your organization; the what is the name of the statement; 
and the when is the time period covered.
In the following sections, I list a few of the more important things that finan-
cial statements can be used for.
Assist with grant proposals
Whenever you submit a grant proposal, you’re usually required to attach 
copies of your organization’s audited financial statements. Audited financial 
statements must be compiled by an independent accounting firm or CPA. The 
CPA provides an opinion on whether the information in the financial state-
ments can be relied upon. (See Chapter 20 for more on audits.)
Government entities (federal agencies), corporate, and foundation grant 
makers want an overview of your nonprofit’s financial activities and its ability 
to properly manage its finances. Many want to see if your organization has 
the capacity to manage a grant. Trust me, grant makers know just what to 
look for to determine if your organization is a wise investment. Being a good 
steward of your organization’s finances has its rewards.

A glance at the financial statements can either make you or break you. For 
example, if your organization has an operating budget of $25,000 and you’re 
applying for a $150,000 grant, do you think it matters to the funder that 
you’ve never managed such a large sum of money? Yes, it does.
Allow you to track donations
Accurate financial statements allow internal users to project and anticipate 
potential changes in giving trends. You need to keep a close eye on changes 
in donations to properly project financial problems. Analyzing giving trends 
allows internal users to make decisions faster about increasing fundraising 
goals.
 
Keeping an accurate record of projected or pledged donations versus actual 
donations affects a nonprofit’s ability to pay bills and meet payroll. Balancing 
the inflow with the outflow can feel like a juggling act. Your ultimate objective 
is to ensure you have enough cash to pay the bills.
All nonprofit organizations are required to keep a donors list on file. Your 
auditor will test your list by randomly contacting some of the donors. 
Tracking all donations isn’t an option; it’s a requirement. For more informa-
tion about tracking donations, see Chapter 7.
Track nonprofit activities
Many nonprofit organizations receive income from government grants, foun-
dations, corporate grants, fundraising activities, and donations. The financial 
statements, particularly the cash flow statement (refer to “Developing the 
cash flow statement” section later in this chapter for more info), let you keep 
track of important nonprofit activities, such as how much income will be allo-
cated to pay for specific needs.
Nonprofit organizations must track income and expenses carefully to know 
and understand their financial situation. A good place to start is by balanc-
ing the nonprofit checkbook, which tracks expenses and deposits made into 
your checking account.
 
Record transactions in the checkbook register when transactions take place. 
Your checkbook register will contain records of every donation, all expenses 
paid, and a running balance of cash on hand. You’ll know by your balance how 
closely you need to monitor your checkbook. (Chapter 7 covers how to balance 
your nonprofit’s checkbook.)

 Chapter 3: Introducing Financial Statements
Indicate lawsuits: Contingent liabilities
Accurate financial statements also provide important information about 
incidents or potential liabilities, such as lawsuits, in the notes section of the 
statements. This information reveals how much money may be paid out. If 
your organization is facing any pending litigation, and it appears that the 
charges are true or that the defendant will win the suit, then you should 
disclose a contingent liability in the notes to the financial statements. A con-
tingent liability is a potential liability pending a certain action, such as a court 
matter to be decided by a settlement, a judge, and/or jury.
With this information, internal and external users get a better picture of your 
true financial status and any potential liabilities. Check out the nearby side-
bar about how insurance can safeguard your nonprofit from lawsuits.
Identifying the Financial Statements
In order to show an accurate picture of your nonprofit’s bottom line, you 
prepare financial statements. These statements show how much revenue has 
come in, what your expenses are, and whether you’re in the red or black. The 
following sections give a quick outline of the different financial statements 
your nonprofit needs to compile and prepare at the end of your accounting 
period.
Reading the statement of activities
The statement of activities (also known as the income statement; the statement 
of revenue, expenses, and changes in fund balances; or the profit and loss state-
ment) reveals where the nonprofit money came from, where it went, and how 
a nonprofit has operated during a given period. It reveals whether your orga-
nization was profitable for the year. Figure 3-1 shows a sample.
All grants, contributions, interest income, and gains on the sale of marketable 
securities or sale of stock — basically, any money you bring in — are rev-
enue line items on the statement of activities, followed by all expenses — any 
money you spend, whether it’s for salaries, new programs, or events to raise 
more money.
The first item to pay attention to when reading a statement of activities 
appears at the end of the statement. After you add all the revenues and sub-
tract all the expenses, you’ll either have a surplus (net profit) or deficit (net 
loss). A net profit is when revenues are more than expenses, while a net loss 
is when expenses are more than revenues. You want to know whether the 
bottom line is a positive number or a negative number.

 Chapter 3: Introducing Financial Statements
At the very bottom of the statement of activities you find net income (or net 
assets). Net income is the difference between revenues and expenses. This 
figure is transferred to the statement of financial position as an asset (see the 
“Working with the statement of financial position” section for more on these 
statements).
 
Anytime you see the word net in relation to financial statements, it means 
whatever remains after subtracting deductions, expenses, or losses. A good 
way to think of net is to think of a paystub. You have gross pay less deduc-
tions, and the employee takes home the net pay.
 
Although the statement of activities may be the first statement that comes to 
mind when you think of financial statements, the information is useful, but lim-
ited. The statement of activities doesn’t give the full financial position. You 
also need to rely on the other financial statements I explain in this chapter. 
This section gives you a starting point to help you grasp the statement of 
activities better. I cover this statement in more detail in Chapter 15.
Protecting your nonprofit with liability insurance
If your nonprofit has direct contact with vulner-
able people, such as children, the elderly, or 
individuals with developmental disabilities, you 
probably should protect yourself from potential 
lawsuits. To protect your nonprofit from poten-
tial disaster, consider speaking with your board 
about liability insurance. Liability insurance is 
important because it protects your assets.
Insurance can protect against lawsuits for any 
of the following:
 ✓ Alleged violations
 ✓ Breach of contract
 ✓ Discrimination
 ✓ Fraudulent conduct, reports, or financial 
statements
 ✓ Improper self-dealing
 ✓ Misuse of restricted funds
 ✓ Personal injury
 ✓ Sexual harassment
 ✓ Violation of state and federal laws
 ✓ Wrongful termination
If your organization has any of the preceding 
charges pending litigation, you should consult 
with an attorney.

Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Working with the statement 
of financial position
The statement of financial position (also referred to as the balance sheet or 
the statement of changes in fund balance) reports the amounts of a nonprofit’s 
assets, liabilities, and net assets as of a specified date (see Chapter 2 for expla-
nations of these terms). The statement of financial position (see Figure 3-2 for 
an example) is a true indicator of financial health as of a given date for a speci-
fied period.
A quick glance at the statement of financial position reveals the organiza-
tion’s solvency. Solvency indicates whether an organization can meet its 
obligations on time. If current assets are less than current liabilities, then 
you need to sell some investments, borrow some money, or hold a fundraiser 
to stay financially healthy. (Current means now or within one year.) Flip to 
Chapter 16 for more nitty gritty on this statement.
Developing the cash flow statement
The cash flow statement (also referred to as the statement of changes in finan-
cial position or the cash flow of fund statement) records cash coming in and 
cash going out. This report (refer to Figure 3-3) isn’t done just at the end of 
the year; most nonprofits like to keep a close eye on the timing of donations 
to ensure they have enough money on hand to pay their debts, whether it’s 
an employee’s salary or a bank loan. This report is done monthly, quarterly, 
and annually.
 
The most crucial internal statement needed on a monthly basis, particularly 
for your executive director and board members, is the cash flow statement 
because it determines whether the lights stay on. Face it: Your nonprofit isn’t 
operating on a fixed income. Its livelihood depends on donations from others. 
Figuring out FASB
The Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB) sets standards for nonprofit organiza-
tions concerning financial matters. To under-
stand what it is and what it does, think of 
the agency as the financial rule maker. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
authorized FASB to establish financial account-
ing and reporting standards for publicly held 
companies. When you have to compile or read 
a statement of activities, statement of financial 
position, or another page filled with accounting 
numbers, you have the FASB to thank.

Donations can fluctuate, so your cash flow will go up and down within any 
given month. If you make a sudden move while driving your car on the inter-
state at 70 mph, you’re subject to crash. The same is true of your nonprofit; 
if sudden changes in giving trends take place, the walls may tumble down. 
Keeping a close eye on cash can prevent potential disaster.
The cash flow statement resembles a monthly household budget. When you 
subtract your expenses from your income, you get either a surplus or a defi-
cit. A surplus is a positive number, which means your income is more than 
your expenses. A deficit is a negative number, which means your expenses 
are more than your income.

In a nutshell, the cash flow statement reveals how liquid your organization 
is. Liquid refers to your ability to easily convert your current assets into cash 
without losing your socks. Liquid assets have the following characteristics:
 
✓ The sale of a liquid asset doesn’t result in significant loss.
 
✓ A liquid asset usually can be converted into cash within 24 hours.
Chapter 17 provides more in-depth coverage on the cash flow statement.

 Chapter 3: Introducing Financial Statements
Grasping the statement 
of functional expense
The statement of functional expense presents expenses listed on the state-
ment of activities based on their use. The statement of functional expense 
separates expenses based on how much time was spent doing something. 
At the end of the day, everyone wants to know how you spent your time 
and money. Allocating expenses provides an accurate gauge when analyz-
ing expenses. For example, you can take the total fundraising expenses and 
divide it by total expenses and get a better handle on how much was spent 
on fundraising costs. Without adequate accounts for time, it’s virtually 
impossible to know how much your organization actually spent.
Generally, functional expenses are classified as
 
✓ Program
 
✓ Management and general
 
✓ Fundraising expenses
Figure 3-4 shows a sample statement of functional expense. This breakdown 
shows exactly how much was spent on what. I talk more about the analysis of 
these expenses in Chapter 18.
Documenting the notes to 
the financial statements
You can find the most pertinent information about your nonprofit’s financial 
situation in the notes to the financial statements, commonly referred to as foot-
notes. Accurately reporting your organization’s financial statement is a matter 
of ethics. As a nonprofit manager, executive director, or board member, you 
have a responsibility to stay on top of the organization’s financial situation.
Accounting periods: Your choice
An accounting period is the tracking time of 
financial information, usually 12 months. It’s 
also referred to as a fiscal period. Your organi-
zation’s board can choose its accounting year. 
Many government entities begin their account-
ing period on October 1 and end on September 
30. Some organizations prefer using the calen-
dar year by beginning in January and ending 
in December. At the end of your accounting 
period, you prepare financial statements to see 
how you did.

 Chapter 3: Introducing Financial Statements
Reading the notes can provide to the internal and external users additional 
information that may greatly influence their judgment about the future liveli-
hood of your organization. In the notes, you can find the following:
 
✓ Summary of accounting policies: This section discloses choices made 
from different accounting methods, such as cash or accrual basis of 
recording transactions. The difference between cash and accrual basis 
is in the timing of when you record transactions (see Chapter 2 for a full 
explanation).
 
✓ Detailed information about all the statements: This section includes 
info about all financial statements, such as property, equipment, and 
debts.
 
✓ Contingencies: These are future events that may occur but whose 
occurrence is not certain.
For example, if you notice drastic changes or fluctuations in net assets, one 
quick way to detect what has happened is to look at the notes. All changes 
in accounting procedures and methods must be disclosed in the notes. The 
following sections point out what information you need to include in your 
nonprofit’s notes to the financial statements. (For more info about the notes 
and a sample document, see Chapter 19.)
Explain changes in accounting methods
If you modify your accounting methods, the notes to the financial statements 
is the place to explain the whys and wherefores of what you did. Changes 
in accounting methods directly affect an organization’s finances. Tinkering 
with the accounting methods can make your organization look profitable or 
unfavorable. In the wake of the accounting scandals over the last decades, 
tougher laws and a call for accountability are inevitable for nonprofits. As a 
result, when executive directors, board members, and accountants decide to 
make a change, it should be disclosed in the notes.
 
A general rule for accountants is to choose a method and stick with it, thus 
referred to as the consistency principle. Changing your method of deprecia-
tion and accounting method from cash to accrual have a profound effect on 
accounts on your statement of financial position. (Check out Chapter 2 for 
clarification on these two accounting methods.)
Disclose relevant information
One of the most important bits of information you need to have in the notes 
to the financial statements is an accurate representation of your nonprofit’s 
overall financial position. All organizations are required to disclose this 

58
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
information. Furthermore, the disclosure principle requires that any perti-
nent information that affects the representation of your nonprofit’s financial 
position — positively or negatively — be disclosed in the notes.
 
According to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) Full 
Disclosure Principle, all important information should be explained to users to 
help them better understand your nonprofit’s financial status. Anything that 
can change your financial position must be shared with internal and external 
users in the notes.
For example, information about pending lawsuits should be disclosed in the 
notes to the financial statements. Refer to the previous section, “Indicate law-
suits: Contingent liabilities,” for more information.
 
Your accounting system fulfills the reporting requirements for all internal 
and external users. Your internal accounting records may reflect more detail 
than your published records. This is not to suggest that something is being 
withheld, but merely that your reports address the needs of the group view-
ing them. For planning and strategizing, you may need more detailed reports 
about expenses and revenues than are required in the statement of activities.

Chapter 4
Keeping Good Records: 
Using a Manual System 
or Computer System
In This Chapter
▶ Designing a manual accounting system
▶ Exploring software assistance
▶ Protecting your computer system
T
o keep good records, you need a central location where you keep all of 
your transactions. Having quick access to reports about your financial 
position is your objective. Record keeping involves tracking your accounts 
and keeping the documents that support the transactions and leave a paper 
trail. This way you always know how much money you have, how much 
you’ve spent, and what you’ve spent it on.
Choosing the method by which you’ll track your income and expenses is up 
to you. You have two choices: You can set up a manual system or use a store-
bought computer system. It doesn’t matter which method you choose as long 
as you get the job done. So where to start? This chapter looks at your two 
options and helps you choose which one is best for you and your nonprofit. 
I also show you how a manual accounting system works, how to convert a 
manual system into a computerized system, and the benefits of doing so. I 
also introduce you to some software and share with you how to protect your 
computer from dangerous viruses.
Going the Manual or Computer Route?
Even with all of the modern technology and computers, many bookkeepers 
and accountants still start with a pencil, pad, and calculator (preferably a 
10-key adding machine) in hand. Many prefer this method because it allows 

60
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
them to understand how the numbers come together. Computers sometimes 
break down, freeze up, or just outright stop working. Being able to do your 
books on paper can save you when a computer glitch sneaks up on you or 
the system fails.
However, some bookkeepers and accountants do rely heavily on computers 
because they provide updates automatically to all files when changes are 
made. For example, computer software can be set up to recalculate totals 
when you make one change to a number or add another one. Using a com-
puter to keep track of your books saves time and energy.
The choice of which system to use is personal. You may need to consider 
how much activity is going on in your nonprofit. Does keeping track of 
your accounting records by using a manual system leave you feeling over-
whelmed? If the answer is yes, then you should consider a computerized 
accounting system to ease your burden. Make sure you understand how your 
accounts are set up. I like to take a pen and pad and write things down first, 
and then I use the computer to verify my math.
In the beginning, I suggest you incorporate both systems into your nonprof-
it’s bookkeeping and accounting systems. The best way to do so is to create 
a paper file with hard copies of your working papers (the numbers added 
on paper). Then transfer the numbers from your working papers into your 
computer files for safekeeping. Press the Print button on your computer at 
least once a month and put the printout with your manual set of accounting 
reports to keep them up-to-date.
One advantage to using both systems is that you have documentation to sup-
port your activities. This will prove helpful when you close out your books 
at the end of the year (see Chapter 19 for more on this). You’ll have a clear 
paper trail to support your activities.
Computer systems aren’t foolproof
As wonderful as computers are at making 
life easier, they’re not immune to problems. 
Occasionally, things get lost, or users make 
mistakes. One day our system analyst did an 
overnight backup and deleted or misplaced 
some important accounting information.
I told the person that my files were missing and 
I needed them within the next week to do a 
quarterly report. The analyst was out of town 
during the week I needed the data, so he wasn’t 
able to get me the missing info. What saved me 
were the hard copies I had printed out and filed. 
I had to resort to a pen, pad, and calculator to

Choosing a Manual System
A manual bookkeeping system is great if you’re a hands-on type of person. With 
this system, you can easily monitor all transactions because you have hard copies 
of all records. Furthermore, writing down numbers and transactions helps the 
brain to remember them. A manual system entails much more than just keeping a 
check register or organizing all of your receipts and canceled checks in an orderly 
fashion. The following sections take a closer look at the pros and cons of using a 
manual system and the characteristics of this type of system.
Knowing the pros and cons
Before you can maintain a manual bookkeeping system, you need to have a firm 
grasp of the advantages and disadvantages of using such a system. Being aware 
of these important considerations can help you more fully understand what your 
manual bookkeeping system can and can’t do for you and your nonprofit.
The following are some pros of using a manual system:
 
✓ It’s less prone to errors because you’re writing things down.
 
✓ You have hard copies of your records available at your fingertips.
 
✓ You gain a greater understanding of your accounting system because 
every step is processed by hand.
Meanwhile here are some important cons for you to consider as you maintain 
your manual system:
 
✓ Using this system can be time consuming because you have to move num-
bers from one report to another manually. If you make an error, you can’t 
correct it without redoing everything or ending up with sloppy reports.
 
✓ Paper files take up space, and if you need something, it can take some 
time to go through your files to find it.
 
✓ Paper discolors and deteriorates, and paper mites find their way to old 
files. Older paper tends to smell funny and turns a brownish color. To 
handle these potential problems, you can scan your documents into 
your computer and then store the hard copies in airtight containers.
 
 Scanning your paper documents and saving the electronic copies on a 
CD is an excellent way to preserve them for long-term storage. After I’ve 
calculated something on paper, I transfer it to a spreadsheet, and then 
I print out the spreadsheet and attach the handwritten paper. Then I 
place the two in a file. As time permits, I create CDs. I destroy the origi-
nal documents after about three years.

Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Eyeing the parts of a manual system
To use a manual bookkeeping system, you need to understand the tools 
you need: a checkbook register, an adding machine with a tape, and a filing 
system. This section focuses on the three main components you use when 
maintaining your nonprofit’s books manually. Remember: The name of the 
game is to account for and track all transactions with solid documentation to 
back you up.
Using a check register: Documenting checkbook transactions
Inside every new box of checks, you find a checkbook register where you can 
document each transaction affecting your account. This register is an essen-
tial part of your manual bookkeeping system. Logging every transaction as 
soon as you know a deposit has been made or a check has been written is 
good financial management. You use this register to record your written checks, 
deposits, checking fees, and debit card transactions. Maintaining the register 
takes a little time and effort, but it’s important to balancing your finances. Check 
out Chapter 7 for more information on how to use the register.
Punching a 10-key adding machine: Calculating your income
A 10-key adding machine that runs tape is another important component of 
your manual bookkeeping system. Using this machine is a good way to calculate 
income. When working with numbers, it’s easy to make transposition errors and 
write numerals down differently than how they appear. The tape that the 10-key 
adding machine spits out is an excellent tool to verify your numbers after you’ve 
calculated them. (You can use a calculator that doesn’t print out a tape, but then 
it’s harder to check for mistakes when the numbers don’t add up correctly.)
 
Attach your adding machine tape to the documents you took the numbers 
from and file everything together.
Keeping track of everything: Organizing hard copies
The third component of a manual bookkeeping system is good organiza-
tion. You have to keep track of all the merchant receipts, written checks, 
and so forth. Doing so helps you prove purchases, and it also proves that a 
transaction took place on a certain date at a given time and in a given place. 
Mistakes happen (that’s human nature), and you need to protect your assets 
and guard your money. You can correct errors faster and easier by having 
the necessary papers organized and accessible.
You’ll also want to keep your donors list on file for auditing purposes. It’s 
important to keep records of all the income your nonprofit receives and the 
sources of that income. This information is needed when your books are 
audited. (For more about donor information, see Chapter 7.)
If you decide to track the day-to-day operations manually and then deliver 
the necessary documents to your accountant to prepare your financial 

63
 Chapter 4: Keeping Good Records: Using a Manual System or Computer System
statements, the first thing your accountant will want to see is proof of pur-
chases and transactions. If you’re not organized and don’t have everything in 
order, you’re in for a frustrating experience.
 
To keep your paperwork organized, I suggest you do the following:
 
✓ Make a hard copy of all records.
 
✓ Place all important documents in clearly labeled and easily accessible 
file folders. Some nonprofits label files by the month and create a cross-
reference system if they do a lot of transactions with a large vendor. This 
system makes it easier to do monthly and quarterly financial reports.
 
✓ Store all records for at least three years for auditing purposes.
Trying Excel: The Easy Computer Route
If you want to use a computer bookkeeping system for your nonprofit, you 
don’t have to start off with an expensive, intricate system that requires a PhD 
and CPA to master. Even if you’re not computer savvy, you can still incorpo-
rate Excel into your bookkeeping system. The program is popular with many 
bookkeepers and accountants today.
Excel is an electronic worksheet program that sorts, stores, and calculates 
data. Using the software, you can create spreadsheets, which consist of rows 
and columns. After you enter information into the spreadsheet, you can cal-
culate totals, create tables and graphs, and analyze financial data. The pro-
gram is also useful for making lists of donors and charts of accounts.
The following are some pros to using Excel:
 
✓ You can use the software to compare information from one period with 
current information.
 
✓ You can store your accounting information on your desktop or a CD.
 
✓ With a little practice you can put together some professional-looking 
reports using Excel spreadsheets. You can include some pretty impres-
sive pie charts and graphs in your financial reports.
Working with Excel isn’t all efficiency and automatic calculations, though. 
Here are some important cons to consider:
 
✓ Excel offers so many options in the toolbar that you may feel you have 
too many choices until you get familiar with the program.
 
✓ You may become too dependent on the computer doing all the work. 
If the software or your computer fails, you’ll need to remember how to 
keep your books manually.

64
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
In the following sections, I show you how you can take baby steps and use 
Excel in your bookkeeping. You can see how a simple spreadsheet can make 
your life easier. For more detailed information about how to use Excel and all 
of its bells and whistles, check out Excel 2007 For Dummies by Greg Harvey 
(Wiley) or Excel 2003 For Dummies by Greg Harvey (if you’re using an older 
version).
Breaking down the spreadsheet
Spreadsheets are the centerpiece of Excel. They’re where you enter your data; 
after you’ve completed that task, you can crunch the numbers, sort data, 
track spending and income, and perform countless other functions. This sec-
tion gives you a quick overview of the all-important spreadsheet.
A spreadsheet is commonly referred to as a worksheet. Every Excel spread-
sheet has the following components:
 
✓ Columns: Columns run up and down (vertically), and they’re identified 
alphabetically on the top of the spreadsheet.
 
✓ Rows: Rows run from side to side (horizontally). Each row is numbered 
on the left side.
 
✓ Cells: The place where a column and row intersect is called a cell, and it 
looks like a rectangle. A cell is labeled by a letter and number (so a cell 
two columns in and three rows down would be labeled B3). You enter 
the data into the cells.
You can use spreadsheets to make your job easier, no matter your position 
with your nonprofit. Spreadsheets store the following three basic types of data:
 
✓ Labels are written text with no numerical value and are used to identify 
information. Labels consist of data that begins with a letter, like a list of 
names. They are typically found in the first cell of a column or row. For 
example, you can create a list of the donors who gave to a fundraiser by 
entering names of individuals.
 
✓ Numbers are digits or entries that have a fixed value. For example, you 
can enter the amount given by each donor in the cell next to the per-
son’s name.
 
✓ Formulas are mathematical equations used to make calculations. On the 
toolbar at the top of the spreadsheet is a button used to do mathemati-
cal computations. For example, if you want to know how much a donor 
has contributed over the year, you can use the Add Sum button to get 
the total.

65
 Chapter 4: Keeping Good Records: Using a Manual System or Computer System
Converting your manual system 
into a spreadsheet
If you’ve been using a manual bookkeeping system and want to move to a com-
puter system, an Excel spreadsheet is a good place to start. You can use Excel 
to verify your totals in your manual bookkeeping system until you become more 
comfortable with Excel. To make this conversion, complete the following steps:
 
1. To open a new spreadsheet, click the Office button. Then scroll down 
and click New on the Office menu to open a blank spreadsheet.
 
2. To set up the spreadsheet, enter labels in the first cell of each column 
and row.
 
 Creating these labels allows you to identify the data. For example, you 
can enter donor names in the first column, one name per cell, and vari-
ous fundraising events in the first row, one event per cell.
 
3. Enter your data into the appropriate cells.
 
 The cell where a column and row intersects is where you enter the 
data specific to those two situations. So if Mr. Smith donated money at 
Fundraisers A, C, and D, you’d enter a number in the appropriate cells, 
skipping the one for Fundraiser B (or entering a zero).
 
 To quickly move from one cell to another, use the arrow keys on your 
computer keyboard. Another way to navigate through an Excel spread-
sheet is by using your tab key.
 
4. After you enter your information, click the SUM button to tabulate 
your totals.
 
 When you’re ready to calculate totals on your spreadsheet, you’ll use 
formulas. You can use the SUM button to have the computer do the 
math and make your job easier. The SUM function button (it looks like 
a very angular capital E) is located at the top of the toolbar underneath 
the Help button on the upper-right-hand corner. Clicking it calculates 
values in a range of cells faster than you can even imagine. It can add, 
subtract, divide, multiply, and compute averages and means in a range 
of cells. All you have to do is enter data into the cells and use the SUM 
button to do the math.
 
 All math equations or formulas must begin with an equal sign. The com-
puter automatically inserts an equal sign when you use the SUM button, 
but if you decide to write your own equations, make sure you start with 
an equal sign. Otherwise, the computer won’t compute anything for 
that cell. (I don’t cover equation writing in this book. If you’re ambitious 
enough to tackle that, check out one of the Excel For Dummies books 
mentioned earlier in the chapter.)

66
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Here’s how to use the SUM function:
 
1. Click the cell where you want your total to appear on your 
spreadsheet.
 
2. Click the SUM function button on your toolbar.
 
3. Drag your mouse over the cells that you want to add and press the 
Enter button on your keyboard. The total should appear in the cell 
you clicked in Step 1.
 
You can use the SUM button to do more than add numbers. You can click 
inside a formula and change the colon to
 
✓ A minus sign (–) to subtract numbers
 
✓ A asterisk (*) to multiply numbers
 
✓ A backslash (/) to divide numbers
For example, if you want to know how much money you’ve got left at the end 
of the month, you need to subtract your expenses from your income. First 
add all your income in one column, and then add all expenses in another 
column. After you have those totals, you can select those two cells and tell 
the computer to subtract the expenses from the income just by changing the 
colon to a minus sign. (If you get a negative answer, you probably need to 
reverse the order of the cells in the formula.)
 
If you need more help getting started with Excel, just click the Help button 
(the question mark) on the toolbar to go to the tutorial. This easy-to-follow 
information can help you navigate your way around a spreadsheet.
 
The best way to get comfortable with using Excel is to play with a spreadsheet 
by entering information and clicking different icons on the toolbar. Do this on 
simple numbers when you’ve got some time before trying to use the software 
to meet a deadline.
Naming Other Available Software
If you’re a tad bit more computer savvy and want to elevate your nonprofit’s 
bookkeeping and accounting, you may consider using more advanced com-
puter software. Several programs are available to make bookkeeping and 
accounting much easier for your organization.
Although these programs can greatly help your organization, they do require 
you to invest some time in reading up on the software and spend some money 
for it. Check out some of the more common ones available to help you with 
your nonprofit’s bookkeeping and accounting.

 Chapter 4: Keeping Good Records: Using a Manual System or Computer System
QuickBooks
QuickBooks is widely used by smaller organizations because of its price and 
ease of use. You can purchase QuickBooks Premier, which includes a version 
for nonprofit organizations, for $400 to $1,000, depending on the number of 
people who’ll be using it. QuickBooks can help you
 
✓ Track bank account balances
 
✓ Calculate payroll and sales taxes
 
✓ Prepare payroll
 
✓ Prepare and print financial reports
 
✓ Track credit cards
 
✓ Write and print checks
QuickBooks isn’t a bad investment because it can help your organization with 
quite a few tasks. However, before you drop coin for this software, make sure 
you’re aware of its limitations. QuickBooks isn’t for an organization with more 
than five users online at the same time. So if you have managers, board mem-
bers, and office staff who share your computer files, no more than five people 
can use the software at the same time because of the terms of the license agree-
ment. For a free download of QuickBooks, go to www.quickbooks.com. If 
you’re interested in checking out how it can help your organization, check 
out the latest version of QuickBooks For Dummies by Stephen L. Nelson, CPA, 
MBA, MS (Wiley).
Microsoft Office Accounting
You may want to consider Microsoft Office Accounting for your accounting 
needs. The price starts at $200. The program offers the following features:
 
✓ A payroll center that allows you to run payroll, print checks, print 
reports, file taxes, and so on
 
✓ Journal entries for recording transactions, and if you attempt to enter 
account information that throws your system out of balance, a warning 
message is displayed
 
✓ System accounts including accounts receivable, accounts payable, pay-
roll liabilities, bank charges, and so on
 
✓ Report generation for budgets, financial statements, and so on
 
✓ The ability to work with Microsoft Excel and export data to Microsoft 
Office Accounting

68
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
Even though Office Accounting is ideally suited for small businesses, it’s not 
specifically designed for nonprofit organizations. However, it is affordable. 
Another drawback is that you may be forced to upgrade other Microsoft 
programs to keep all the programs (such as Excel and Word) compatible. 
Office Accounting Express is offered as a free download at http://office.
microsoft.com.
Peachtree Accounting
Peachtree Accounting software has been around for more than 30 years. 
As your financial needs expand, Peachtree allows you to upgrade your soft-
ware package. Peachtree is for larger, more advanced nonprofits with large 
operating budgets that can’t keep up with their bookkeeping without auto-
mated help. This program costs a bit more at $550. Unlike Office Accounting, 
Peachtree is specifically designed for nonprofits. Some of the functions per-
formed by Peachtree include
 
✓ An advanced internal accounting review system that checks for common 
accounting mistakes. It also tracks unusual transactions and flags them 
for review.
 
✓ An online bank reconciliation system that reconciles your records with 
your bank statement. This feature saves lots of time when everything 
balances.
 
✓ The ability to export data to Excel keeping formulas intact. This allows 
you to work from a different worksheet and convert your information 
with ease.
 
✓ Easy conversion from QuickBooks. If you started out small with 
QuickBooks and you’ve grown, Peachtree allows you to convert your 
QuickBooks accounts into its system.
 
✓ Creation of sophisticated reports that allow you to compare finances 
from the current periods with other accounting periods. For example, if 
you want to see how your donations came in during a certain month in 
the last three years, this system can easily retrieve that information.
The pros of using Peachtree may also be cons, depending on the size of 
your organization. This software allows you to do extensive analysis of your 
accounting records and allows you to compare your numbers to other non-
profits. However, you may not need the advanced reports and analysis tools 
that Peachtree offers. If you’re a small nonprofit and only a couple of people 
need access to your books, Peachtree may be too much system for you. To 
try Peachtree Accounting for 60 days, go to the following Web site: http://

 Chapter 4: Keeping Good Records: Using a Manual System or Computer System
Ensuring Your System Is Secure
Your nonprofit’s financial records contain important and confidential infor-
mation that you can’t risk losing, damaging, or having fall into the wrong 
hands. Security is especially important when your bookkeeping and account-
ing records are on a computer system. If your system becomes contaminated 
with a virus, you may lose your files and never be able to recover them. In 
the worst-case scenario, if you store bank account information on your com-
puter, someone may hack into your computer and steal the information he 
needs to liquidate your nonprofit’s (or even your donors’) bank accounts.
That’s why ensuring that your computer system is secure is essential. 
Although nothing is 100 percent secure, you can take the measures I outline 
in the following sections to give you peace of mind.
 
You can choose from all sorts of programs to protect your computer system. 
Some of the software is free online, and some can be purchased for a hefty fee. 
Because I don’t know the particulars of your situation, I give you the basics of 
what you need to know to protect your information, but I don’t recommend spe-
cific software. Instead, talk to someone at your local computer store for help.
Firewalls and virus scanners
In securing your computer system, two of the first lines of defense are a firewall 
and virus scanner. A firewall is a barrier that prevents outside users from access-
ing protected areas of your computer system and tampering with or peering into 
sensitive materials. A firewall allows you to control who has access to materials 
you deem for public or private use. Firewalls come in two types:
 
✓ A software firewall is a program usually installed on a single computer 
that protects a computer against unauthorized users to and from the 
Internet.
 
✓ Hardware firewalls are called routers. Routers direct information to and 
from the Internet through a network. (A network is a group of computers 
that can transmit information between themselves.)
 
To figure out which type of firewall you need, talk to the person in charge of 
maintaining your computer system.
Meanwhile, a virus scanner is a program that checks for the presence of viruses 
by examining all the files that are located on your computer. A virus is technol-
ogy’s version of the common cold. It causes your computer to sniffle, cough, 
and spit out garbage. Many programs allow you to scan specific files and 

70
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
folders. They also monitor and scan the information that comes into your 
computer from outside your firewall, as well as stored information within 
your network. When the virus scanner finds a virus, its job is to stop it before 
the virus spreads to your computer and network.
Viruses may lurk in harmless e-mails and files. When delivered to your e-mail, 
they can do the following:
 
✓ Slow down your computer
 
✓ Make your computer unable to perform its normal tasks
 
✓ Cripple your system enough that soon it stops working altogether
Viruses are evil because they can wreak havoc wherever they strike. Viruses 
come in two forms:
 
✓ Worms replicate themselves and are usually found in e-mails. Their primary 
job is to slow down a computer or network’s processes. They eat up 
computer memory and spread themselves from computer to computer.
 
✓ Trojan horses come hidden in programs and files. They don’t replicate 
themselves, but they can mess up systems and sometimes even destroy 
and make them inoperable.
 
As a protective measure, don’t open e-mails from people you don’t know. And 
when you send e-mails to some people, their e-mail system is set up to ask you 
questions before the program will accept your message.
User privileges and file sharing
In ensuring your computer system’s safety, another line of security is user 
privileges and file sharing. User privileges and file sharing mean allowing users 
in your nonprofit to access only the files they need. User privileges determine 
who can view, read, write, copy, modify, and print files, and which files may 
be shared by and with whom.
Usually only one person has control and access to everything, but your non-
profit may require that more than one person has access to all files. This 
person, called the administrator, sets up the user privileges and file sharing 
protocols. The IT (information tech) manager is usually the administrator. 
Other users are given certain rights and privileges for accessing and sharing 
files. These users can be in your network, as well as those who are outside 
your firewall but have been granted access to information.

71
 Chapter 4: Keeping Good Records: Using a Manual System or Computer System
 
Most computer systems use password protection and identification to allow 
users the right to access certain files. It’s a good idea to have your administra-
tor set up your computer system so users have to change their passwords 
every 90 days. This security measure can keep intruders from accessing your 
computer files.
Miscellaneous security programs
Other security measures are available for your nonprofit’s use, depend-
ing on how sophisticated of a system you want. To determine whether you 
need advanced security measures, you must first look at the data you have. 
Consider whether the information could be damaging to your nonprofit or 
others if it were to be viewed by the public. Third-party companies offer the 
necessary software online or at most retail stores that sell office software. 
Your IT or administrator can check into some of the other available programs.
Backing Up Your System
Backing up your system is an essential and vital part of securing your com-
puter system. When you back up files, you save and archive important docu-
ments for potential future use. You should back up essential files that are 
used to run and maintain your nonprofit. This way, you have duplicate copies 
of files in the event of a system failure due to a power outage, equipment fail-
ure, inadvertently deleting files and folders, user errors, natural disaster, and 
malicious activities from within and outside your firewall. System backup is 
usually done by one of the following two methods:
 
✓ Automatic backup: The automatic backup can be set to perform back-
ups at a specific time every day. The automatic backup uses a software 
program to search for and find system files and folders to save for you. 
Most computer operating systems come with automatic backup programs 
to restore your computer to a state before it became corrupt or inoperable.
 
 You can back up your info to different media as long as your system can 
access these modes. Some options for automatic backup include
 
• CDs: Files are copied onto media and stored in a safe place. You 
need to have the correct equipment and software to read and write 
to CDs.
 
• Your computer’s hard drive: The hard drive comes as an external 
and internal piece of equipment. The hard drive is the ideal storage 
place for multiple files because it has a large storage capacity and 
provides easy access to files.

72
Part I: Accounting and Bookkeeping Nonprofit Style 
 
• Third-party software: This type of backup duplicates your com-
puter storage system as a mirror image of computer files and 
folders. Internet sites can provide free online storage for a certain 
amount of time. This option is a good choice if you live in an area 
prone to natural disasters because you can access the storage 
from another computer if yours is destroyed or inaccessible.
 
• USB drive: Also referred to as a jump drive or thumb drive, these 
storage tools are about the size of a lipstick tube. They don’t hold 
as much data as a hard drive, but they hold a lot and can be trans-
ported conveniently.
 
✓ Manual backup: Manually backing up your system uses software also. 
In this process, you choose to save only certain files and folders or cer-
tain aspects or elements of your files and folders. This process can be 
tedious and time consuming. If you want to manually back up files, I sug-
gest you ask your IT person to help.

Balancing Your 
Nonprofit Books

In this part . . .
K
eeping your books in balance can feel like a juggling 
act. Before starting your first act, though, you need 
to set a few things in action. This part helps you jump into 
everything related to keeping your nonprofit’s books 
balanced.
I explain the importance of setting up a chart or list of 
accounts that you will use during the accounting cycle. 
Then, you can begin to record transactions in your 
journals.
You can find the center of your balancing act in your non-
profit checkbook. Basically, you record donations coming 
in and expenses going out. Doing so keeps your eyes 
focused on cash inflows and outflows.
Before you can completely balance all the books, though, 
you have to have a financial plan in place. Your financial 
plan is the budget that supports your programs. 
Developing and operating from a budget is good financial 
management.
Throughout your entire balancing act — when you’re 
setting up your books, recording your monetary activity, 
itemizing your checkbook register, and operating on a 
budget — you have to stay in compliance with state and 
federal nonprofit guidelines.

Accounts for Nonprofits
In This Chapter
▶ Organizing a chart of accounts
▶ Setting up accounting codes
▶ Sorting all types of accounts
I
n order for you to easily keep track of where money is coming from 
and going to in your nonprofit, you use a chart of accounts. The chart 
of accounts is a list of each account that the accounting system tracks; 
it captures the information you need to keep track of and use to make good 
financial decisions.
The chart of accounts is like a big reference card that contains numbers, 
or codes, and names of accounts; no transactions or specific financial 
information is recorded on the chart of accounts. An account code from the 
chart of accounts is recorded into the financial records, and from there into 
financial reports. So, for example, when you receive a donation, you code it 
with one account number. When you owe a vendor, you code it with another 
account number.
This chapter runs down the different accounts in a typical chart, how you 
can personalize your nonprofit’s chart of accounts, and what you need to do 
to code funds coming in and going out of your nonprofit.
Identifying and Naming Your Nonprofit’s 
Main Types of Accounts
When I talk about naming accounts, I don’t mean choosing monikers like 
Sally, Sam, or Susie, so you can put away the book of baby names. Choosing 
names for your nonprofit accounts depends on the type of products or 

76
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
services you provide. Your chart of accounts consists of accounts found 
on your financial statements. Knowing which accounts go with which 
statements helps you to indentify the main types of accounts. For instance, 
the statement of financial position has assets, liabilities, and net assets 
(see Chapter 16 for more on this statement). The statement of activities has 
revenues, expenses, and increases or decreases in net assets (see Chapter 15 
for more on this statement).
A typical chart of accounts (see Figure 5-1) is divided into five categories: 
assets, liabilities, net assets or fund balances, revenues, and expenses. Each 
account is assigned an identifying number for use within your accounting 
system. I explain these five categories in the following sections. Most 
nonprofit organizations have most of the following accounts. Name your 
accounts based on their function. For example, if an account is a revenue 
account, then give it a name to identify the source of revenue. In Figure 5-1, 
you see all revenue accounts start with the number 4. All federal grant 
revenue accounts begin with the number 4, and the second digit is a 1.

in order to give clarity to what’s what. If you run out of numbers, you can 
assign new numbers. My example chart of accounts in Figure 5-1 is merely 
a suggestion of how you can set up your chart. You must decide what’s best 
for you.
Accounting for assets
The first grouping of accounts in a chart of accounts is the assets. Assets are 
the tangible items an organization has as resources, including cash, accounts 
receivable, equipment, and property. Basically, assets provide economic 
benefit to your organization. The following are the main types of assets:
 
✓ Current assets: An asset that will be sold or depleted in the near future 
(within one year) or a business cycle. An example of a current asset 
is cash.
 
✓ Fixed assets: A fixed asset is a long-term tangible asset that your non-
profit uses, and there is no intent to sell the asset. It shouldn’t be sold 
within the current year or business cycle. An example of a fixed asset is 
real estate or furniture.
 
✓ Other assets: Statement of financial position classification that covers 
miscellaneous assets. These are usually valued at less than 5 percent of 
total assets. An example is scrapped equipment held for sale.
Assets are usually listed in descending order of liquidity. This means that 
cash and other assets that are easily converted to cash are listed first, 
and fixed assets are listed last. Notice that all asset accounts begin with 
the number 1 on the chart of accounts (see Figure 5-1). (Check out the 
“Coding the Charges: Assigning Numbers to the Accounts” section later in 
this chapter for more info about numbering.)
The following are asset accounts:
 
✓ Checking account: Here’s where you record cash on deposit in a 
checking account with a bank.
 
✓ Petty cash, change funds, undeposited receipts, cash on hand: This 
account includes cash used by the nonprofit organization for revolving 
funds, change funds (cash used to supply change to customers and 
others; can also be used to cash payroll checks), petty cash funds, and 
undeposited receipts at year-end.
 
✓ Savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit: 
This category records funds on deposit with banks and other financial 
institutions in the form of savings accounts, money market accounts, 
certificates of deposit, and other interest-bearing deposits.

Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
✓ Contributions receivable: When people give you pledges, you record 
them here, even if the donor restricts the pledged contribution to 
use in a future period. However, if the pledge won’t be paid until a 
future period, it should be classified as a non-current asset.
 
✓ Land: This account records the amount paid for the land itself, costs 
incidental to the acquisition of land, and expenditures incurred in 
preparing the land for use.
 
✓ Buildings and improvements: This account records the cost of 
relatively permanent structures used to house people or property. It 
also includes fixtures that are permanently attached to buildings 
and can’t be removed without cutting into walls, ceilings, or floors, or 
without in some way damaging the building.
 
✓ Furniture and equipment: This account records the cost of furniture 
and equipment such as, office desks, chairs, computer tables, copy 
machines, large printers, and the like.
 
✓ Data processing equipment: Here’s where you record the cost of data 
processing equipment used by your nonprofit, such as flat-screen 
monitors, desktop computers, hard drives, and such.
 
✓ Leasehold improvements: These costs usually include improvements 
made to facilities or property leased by your organization.
 
✓ Accumulated depreciation: This account records depreciation that has 
accumulated over time by periodic adjustments for annual depreciation. 
When an asset is sold or a lease is terminated, depreciation recorded for 
the item is removed from the records.
Labeling liabilities
Liabilities are obligations due to creditors; in other words, they’re bills your 
nonprofit owes. Liabilities are payable in money, or in goods or services. 
Liabilities tell readers how much debt the nonprofit is in. Liabilities can be 
classified as current or long-term:
 
✓ Current liabilities: These are obligations that are due within one year or 
within the business cycle. An example is accounts payable.
 
✓ Long-term liabilities: These are liabilities that aren’t due within one year 
or within the current business cycle. Long-term notes payable is an 
example of a long-term liability.
You list current liabilities first followed by long-term liabilities because you 
want to show what’s due in the current business cycle first. All liabilities start 
with the number 2 in the chart of accounts (refer to Figure 5-1). The current 
liabilities second digit is a 1. The long-term liabilities second digit is a 2. 
(Check out the “Coding the Charges: Assigning Numbers to the Accounts” 
section later in this chapter for more info about numbering.)

79
 Chapter 5: Setting up the Chart of Accounts for Nonprofits
See the following list of liabilities and an explanation of each.
 
✓ Accounts payable: This account records current liabilities, which 
represent debts that must be paid within a relatively short period, 
usually no longer than a year.
 
✓ Salary and wages payable: Here’s where you record the liabilities for 
salaries and wages and employee benefits.
 
✓ Accrued payroll: This account records the liability for payrolls accrued 
at year end. The accrual should include all salaries and wages earned by 
employees; thus, this entry would include all time worked by employees 
up to the end of the year.
 
✓ Payroll taxes payable: These accounts record liabilities for various 
payroll taxes payable to governments arising from salaries and wages 
and payroll withholdings.
 
✓ Unearned revenue: This account records amounts that have been 
received by your nonprofit, but the earning process hasn’t been 
completed. For example, if your nonprofit offers subscriptions for one 
year to your inside newsletter and people pay for them annually, you 
have revenue that has been received but not yet earned.
 
✓ Notes payable: You use this account to record the outstanding principle 
due within the next year on notes owed by your organization.
 
✓ Mortgage payable: This is just what it sounds like. You record the 
outstanding principle due within the next year on mortgages.
 
✓ Accrued interest payable: This account records interest due on notes, 
capital leases, and mortgages at the end of the accounting period.
 
✓ Grants payable: If you owe outstanding grant awards to outside 
organizations, you record it here. The figure represents amounts earned 
but not paid at year end.
 
✓ Long-term debt: This account records non-current liabilities, which 
represent debts that must be paid in a future period that is at least one 
year or more after the current fiscal period.
Net assets: What you’re worth
Net assets (your nonprofit’s equity) show the financial worth of the 
organization. They represent the balance remaining after liabilities are 
subtracted from an organization’s assets. (Accounting software designed 
with for-profits in mind may report net assets under the heading equity.) 
Net asset accounts often begin with the number 3. (Check out the “Coding 
the Charges: Assigning Numbers to the Accounts” section later in this 
chapter for more info about numbering.) They are classified as:

80
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
✓ Unrestricted net assets: This account records the balance of unrestricted 
net assets (unrestricted assets less liabilities that will be paid with 
unrestricted assets). Unrestricted net assets generally result from 
revenues that were derived from providing services, producing and 
delivering goods, receiving unrestricted contributions, and receiving 
dividends or interest from investing in income-producing assets, less 
expenses incurred in fulfilling any of those tasks.
 
✓ Temporarily restricted net assets: This account records the balance of 
temporarily restricted net assets. Temporarily restricted assets are for
 
• Support of particular operating activities
 
• Investment for a specified term
 
• Use in a specified future period
 
• Acquisition of long-lived assets
 
 Donors’ temporary restrictions may require that resources be used in 
a later period or after a specified date (time restrictions), or that 
resources be used for a specified purpose (use of purpose restrictions), 
or both.
 
✓ Permanently restricted net assets: This account records the balance 
of permanently restricted net assets. Permanently restricted assets 
have donor-imposed restrictions that don’t expire with time or with the 
completion of activities that fulfill a purpose.
 
Only people and organizations outside your nonprofit can place restrictions 
on grants and gifts. Your board of directors may designate a gift for a specific 
use, but it can turn around and undesignate it. Your nonprofit can’t place 
restrictions on gifts. Restrictions are only enforceable when imposed by 
outside entities.
Revenue: What you earn
Revenue accounts measure gross increases in assets, gross decreases in 
liabilities, or a combination of both when your nonprofit delivers or produces 
goods, renders services, or earns income in other ways during an accounting 
period. Keeping your revenue (donations and income) separate is important 
because you may have to account for what you did with the income. For 
example, you need to account separately for government grant revenue, 
which can be kept separately by using your chart of accounts. You may have 
to account for gifts received with restrictions on them. So assign account 
numbers that clearly identify all revenue sources because this will serve as 
documentation for you during an audit.

81
 Chapter 5: Setting up the Chart of Accounts for Nonprofits
Your chart of accounts helps you keep track of revenue sources. Notice how 
revenue accounts are identified by the second digit (see Figure 5-1). Revenue 
accounts often start with the number 4. (Check out the “Coding the Charges: 
Assigning Numbers to the Accounts” section later in this chapter for more 
info about numbering.) See the following list of accounts:
 
✓ State grants: Generally, state grants and revenues are earned from 
operating grants by incurring qualifying expenses, and they go in this 
account. In this context, qualifying expenses refers to expenses that are 
allowed by the grant award or regulations, are allocable to the grant, 
and are reasonable and necessary to meet the program’s objectives. 
Establish a subaccount for each state grant.
 
✓ Federal grants: This account records revenues earned for grants from 
federal agencies. Generally, revenues are earned for operating grant 
programs and by incurring qualifying expenses. Establish a subaccount 
for each federal grant.
 
✓ Private gifts and grants (contributions): Here’s where you record 
revenues from private gifts and grants, including corporate gifts, grants 
from private foundations, and contributions from individuals. This 
account can also be used for pledges that aren’t contingent upon future 
events. Set up a subaccount for each corporation, unless anonymity is 
requested.
 
✓ Noncash contributions: The value of contributions from individuals 
or organizations not made from cash go in this account. A noncash 
contribution is a transfer of an asset or cancellation of a liability without 
consideration.
 
✓ Donated materials — facilities and equipment: This account is used 
to record the value of donated materials, facilities, and equipment. 
Generally, value is based on the fair value of materials or equipment 
at the time of the donations. Value should be based on a reasonable 
objective basis. For example, when the use of a facility is donated, value 
should be based on the rental value of similar facilities in the area.
 
✓ Donated services: This account is used to record the value of donated 
services. They are divided into two categories:
 
• Donated services — specialized skills: These meet the require-
ments of FASB Statement No. 116 for financial reporting purposes.
 
• Donated services — other: These don’t meet the requirements of 
FASB Statement No. 116.
 
 See Chapter 9 for more about FASB Statement No. 116, Accounting for 
Contributions Received and Made

82
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
✓ Fees from special events: When you collect membership fees and funds 
raised through special events, you record them in this account. 
Subaccounts should be established for each type of fee collected.
 
✓ Special events (net revenue): This account records the net proceeds 
(gross collections less expenses) from special events. Establish 
subaccounts to record receipts and expenses.
 
✓ Investment income: This account records income from investments. 
The balance of these accounts should include investment income 
received during the year, as well as accrued investment income earned 
but not received by year end.
Nonprofit expense: What you spend
You can’t make money without spending money. That’s the informal 
definition of a nonprofit expense. Expenses are expired costs, the using up 
of assets, or incurrence of liabilities from operations. Examples include 
personnel costs, costs of supplies, or current obligations, such as accounts 
payables. Also, losses resulting from the sale of assets such as investments 
are included in this category.
Expenses should be recognized when they are incurred, and revenues should 
be recognized in your accounting books when they are earned. Expense 
accounts often start with the number 5. (Check out “Coding the Charges: 
Assigning Numbers to the Accounts” later in this chapter for more info about 
numbering.)
See the following list of expense accounts:
 
✓ Personnel: This account records personnel costs, payroll taxes, 
employee benefits, professional services (consultants and so on), and 
stipends paid to board members. The objective of this group of 
accounts is to provide information on total personnel costs.
 
✓ Salary and wages: Here’s where you record the cost of salary and 
wages paid to employees of your nonprofit. This account includes 
both full- and part-time personnel costs.
 
✓ Social Security and Medicare contribution: This account records 
the employee’s share of Social Security and Medicare taxes applied to 
salary and wages paid to employees.
 
✓ Retirement contribution: This account records the employee’s 
contribution toward her retirement.
 
✓ Disability insurance contribution: This account is used to record the 
employee’s contribution toward her disability insurance program.

83
 Chapter 5: Setting up the Chart of Accounts for Nonprofits
 
✓ Unemployment insurance contribution: This account records 
the employer’s contribution for employees’ costs of the state 
unemployment insurance program.
 
✓ Workers compensation: Here’s where you record the cost of workers 
compensation insurance premiums for your nonprofit.
 
✓ Board member compensation/stipends: When you pay stipends to 
board members, you record them here. Reimbursements for board 
members expenses’ aren’t recorded in this account; they go in the 
current obligations account.
 
✓ Donated services: This account is used to record the value of services 
donated to the nonprofit and expensed as program services.
 
✓ Contracted services: This account is used to record transactions to 
obtain outside services typically provided by employees of the 
organization.
 
✓ Accounting and tax services: This account records accounting and tax 
services for bookkeeping services, payroll, and preparation of tax 
returns.
 
✓ Legal services: This account is used to record legal services either for 
specific services or retainers.
 
✓ Temporary services: If you use temporary services (like temporary 
clerical or secretarial) from manpower agencies, you record the expense 
in this account.
 
✓ Management services: This account records the costs of management 
services acquired by the organization. For example, these can be 
consulting services.
 
✓ Honorariums: When you pay honorariums (a sum paid to a professional 
for speaking engagements or other services for which no fee is set), you 
record the amount in this category.
 
✓ Supplies and materials: This account records the cost of supplies and 
materials used in the daily operations of your organization.
 
✓ Current obligations: This account records the ongoing cost of opera-
tions other than personnel, supplies and materials, and fixed charges.
 
✓ Travel: Here’s where you record the costs of employee travel, including 
food, lodging, and transportation.
 
✓ Communication (telephone, postage, and so on): This account records 
the costs of telephone (both local service and long-distance charges) 
and postage.
 
✓ Utilities: This account records just what you’d expect: costs for things 
such as electricity, water and sewer, and gas.
 
✓ Printing and binding: This account records the cost of printing, 
binding, and copying.

84
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
✓ Repair and maintenance: Can you guess what this account covers? 
Yep, the costs of routine repairs and maintenance, including service 
contracts.
 
✓ Computer services (accounting, payroll, and so on): This account 
records the cost of purchased computer services, such as accounting 
and payroll processing.
 
✓ Employee training: Here, you record the cost of employee training, 
including tuition, conference registration, and training materials.
 
✓ Advertising and promotion: This account records the cost of 
advertising program services, solicitation of bids, obtaining qualified 
applicants, or advertising fundraising events.
 
✓ Board member expense: Here’s where you record the cost of board 
member travel and per diem expenses.
 
✓ Fixed charges and other expenses: This account records reoccurring 
expenses related to your nonprofit’s operations. For example, these are 
costs that occur monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. They 
include things such as property taxes and interest on bonded debts.
 
✓ Office rent: This is what it is: the cost of office rent. No more, no less.
 
✓ Furniture rental: This account records the cost of furniture rental. 
Lease-purchase agreements that meet the criteria of a financing lease 
(a lease recorded as an asset accompanied by borrowing of funds) 
should be recorded as capital outlays (a liability intended to benefit 
future periods).
 
✓ Equipment rental: This account is used to record the cost of equipment 
rental. Lease-purchase agreements that meet the criteria of a capital 
lease should be recorded as capital outlays.
 
✓ Vehicle rental: You record the cost of vehicle rental in this account. 
Lease-purchase agreements that meet the criteria of a capital lease 
should be recorded as capital outlays.
 
✓ Dues and subscriptions: Here’s another straightforward account. It 
records the costs of dues and subscriptions.
 
✓ Insurance and bonding: This account records the costs of insurance on 
facilities and liability insurance.
 
✓ Books: When you purchase reference materials for the use of employees 
and program participants, you record the cost here.
 
✓ Depreciation: This account records the estimated periodic charge 
against asset values for use, deterioration, or obsolescence.
 
✓ Contracts, grants, and stipends: This account is used to record 
contracts, grants, or stipends with outside organizations or individuals.
 
✓ Other expense: This account records any other expenses not 
classified above.

 Chapter 5: Setting up the Chart of Accounts for Nonprofits
Net income/increase – decrease 
in net assets
The statement of activities subtracts all expenses from revenues to get net 
income or an increase or decrease in net assets. To calculate your net assets 
results, take the change in net assets and add it to your beginning net assets 
to get your net assets, ending balance. For example, after you subtract your 
expenses from your revenues, you get the difference, which is referred to as 
a change in net assets or net income or loss. Take the beginning balance you 
started the period with and add it to your change in net assets. This amount 
equals your net assets ending balance.
Consider the statement of activities; you have revenues, expenses, and a 
change in net assets. This change in net assets is considered net income or 
net loss. Consider the statement of financial position, where you have assets, 
liabilities, and net assets. The difference between your total assets and 
total liabilities equals your total net assets. These total net assets are your 
nonprofit’s equity.
Coding the Charges: Assigning 
Numbers to the Accounts
Your chart of accounts is a list of all accounts used in the five categories I 
discuss in the previous section. The chart of accounts assigns specific 
account names and numbers to each account found on your statement of 
activities and statement of financial position.
You recognize account types by looking at the first digit or leading number. 
To number your accounts, remember this basic numbering system:
 
✓ Asset accounts begin with the number 1, so 1110 to 1999 are assigned to 
asset accounts.
 
✓ Liability accounts begin with the number 2, so 2110 to 2999 are assigned 
to liability accounts.
 
✓ Equity accounts begin with the number 3, so 3110 to 3999 are assigned 
to equity accounts.
 
✓ Revenue accounts begin with the number 4, so 4110 to 4999 are assigned 
to revenue accounts.
 
✓ Expense accounts begin with the number 5, so 5110 to 5999 are assigned 
to expense accounts.

86
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
Within each category of accounts, the second digit identifies the subclassifi-
cation. For example,
 
✓ Within 1110 to 1231 of asset accounts, you have
 
• 1111 to 1170 as current assets.
 
• 1210 to 1231 as long-term assets.
 
✓ Within 2110 to 2220 of liability accounts, you have
 
• 2110 to 2130 as current liabilities.
 
• 2210 to 2220 as long-term liabilities.
You use your chart of accounts to code accounting transactions. This chart 
can help you locate accounts in your ledger. Furthermore, you need to 
follow a systematic approach of assigning numbers to your accounts. Having 
a systematic method to identify your accounts helps when errors are made 
while preparing your trial balance. For more about your ledger and trial 
balance, see Chapter 6.

Chapter 6
Recording Transactions 
and Journal Entries
In This Chapter
▶ Getting an overview of the accounting process
▶ Making entries in the journal
▶ Transferring information to the general ledger
▶ Seeing if everything balances
▶ Finding and fixing errors
Just like a coin has two sides (a head and a tail), an account has two sides 
(a debit and a credit). When your nonprofit makes a transaction, you 
have to record in two or more accounts the debit (the left side of an account) 
and credit (the right side of an account). When you record the transaction in 
your accounting books, you’re making a journal entry.
This chapter touches on the basics, including the different types of account-
ing and an overview of the accounting process. With this information you can 
make journal entries, prepare a worksheet, make adjusting entries, and find 
errors in your books.
Choosing Your Basis of Accounting
Most organizations use two methods of accounting to track their transac-
tions. Your nonprofit’s basis of accounting basically is the method by which 
you account for things. You can account for things when they happen or you 

88
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
can wait until later. The method you choose affects when you make journal 
entries about transactions. They’re centered on how and when you recognize 
revenues and expenses.
You need to choose between the two following methods:
 
✓ Cash-basis accounting: The cash-basis method is simple to use because 
you recognize that a transaction has taken place only when you receive 
or distribute cash.
 
✓ Accrual-basis accounting: The accrual-based system recognizes 
revenues when a promise or pledge is given and when revenues are 
earned, while expenses are recognized when they’re incurred and 
not when they’re paid.
Your donors aren’t concerned with which method you use to account for 
your finances. They’re more concerned that you effectively manage the 
funding and use it for its intended purpose. Check out Chapter 2 for more on 
the ins and outs of these two types of accounting methods.
 
Using the accrual method of accounting is your best choice. All financial 
statements must be prepared according to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) using the accrual method. To keep things simple, go with 
the accrual basis to stay in compliance with GAAP.
If you’re running a small nonprofit and you’re keeping your own books 
or you have a part-time bookkeeper doing the work, you may want to 
account for your transactions on the cash basis and pass the books on 
to your accountant or CPA firm at the end of the year to compile your 
financial statements. Your CPA can convert your cash-basis books to 
accrual basis.
Going through the Accounting Process
Although accounting can be quite maddening at times, it does follow a clear 
logic. As you try to get a firm grasp of the accounting process, start with 
the end in mind first. In the end you provide financial statements. Your 
donors care that your financial statements fairly represent your true financial 
position for a given time period as of a certain date. So your goal is to keep 
adequate records that enable you to account for every transaction. The 
following sections highlight the nuts and bolts of the accounting process and 
what the general recording process looks like.

89
 Chapter 6: Recording Transactions and Journal Entries
Eyeing the specifics of the process
To fully understand how to record and track your nonprofit’s financial 
transactions, you need to understand the ins and outs of the process. You 
also need to know what the different accounts are and how putting them 
together creates your nonprofit’s bottom line.
 
So how does the process work? It starts when your organization receives a 
donation. You enter the donation into a journal and post it to the general 
ledger (check out the later sections in this chapter for the specific how-to). 
Once a month or when the accounting period is over, you (or your book-
keeping and accounting staff) prepare a trial balance. A trial balance is a 
listing of all accounts and their balances. If the total of the accounts debit 
balances equals the total of the accounts credit balances, then your accounts 
are in balance (refer to the “Reaching the Trial Balance” section later in this 
chapter for more specific direction).
At the end of the month or year, you take your unadjusted trial balance (a trial 
balance prepared before adjustments; it’s the account balances from your 
ledger) and make adjusting entries. Adjusting entries are made to your 
accounts to bring them to their actual balance. For example, adjustments are 
made for prepaid accounts and for expenses incurred but not yet paid. You 
make adjustments to
 
✓ Accrued revenue (earned revenue that hasn’t been recorded because 
payment hasn’t been received)
 
✓ Accrued salaries that are unpaid and unrecorded
 
✓ Depreciation (allocating the cost and usage of assets as expense)
 
✓ Prepaid expenses, such as insurance
 
✓ Office supplies used
 
✓ Unearned revenue (payments received in advance)
After you finish adjusting the entries and everything balances, you’re 
ready to do an adjusted trial balance. Your adjusted trial balance verifies 
that things are in balance. If your entries are out of balance, then you 
must find your errors. I help you with this in the “Correcting errors” section 
later in this chapter. Figure 6-1 provides a snapshot of the accounting 
process.

Looking at the two sides of an account
Before you begin recording transactions and making journal entries, you 
need to understand debits and credits. You even need to record purchases 
made with cash in your books. Why? When you disburse cash, it reduces the 
amount you have available. You make a journal entry to decrease cash, or a 
credit. And if the purchase adds something of value, such as an asset, you 
increase what you have, so you debit. When you fully understand debits 
and credits, you’ll be able to do journal entries like a pro. Knowing this infor-
mation is important because it’s the building blocks for your record-keeping 
transactions. If you make a mistake at the beginning of the accounting cycle, 
finding it later is more difficult and can throw your books out of balance.
For example, you purchase $100 of office supplies. You have to credit your 
cash, which means your cash decreases by $100. You enter this transaction 
on the right. You also debit your office supplies, which increases your assets. 
You enter this transaction on the left.
 
To understand journal entries, you need to know the mechanics of accounting. 
You should remember the following.
 
✓ Revenue, liability, and equity accounts are increased by credits.
 
✓ Asset and expense accounts are increased by debits.

91
 Chapter 6: Recording Transactions and Journal Entries
 
Think of accounts as having two sides. The debit side is on the left, and the 
credit side is on the right. And because credits increase revenue, liability, 
and equity accounts, debits decrease them. Think of your journal page like a 
capital “T.” Any transaction you enter on the left is a debit; anything you enter 
on the right is a credit. If you hear someone talk about “T” accounts, this is 
what they mean.
Consider the debit and credit outline in Table 6-1. This table shows you how 
normal balances affect accounts on the statement of financial position and 
statement of activities. Normal balances indicate what you do to increase the 
accounts. To decrease the accounts, you do the opposite. For example, 
because a debit increases an expense account, to decrease an expense, you 
credit the account.

Recording Journal Entries
I try to write in my personal journal every day to reflect on the events of the 
day. In accounting you use a journal to record transactions in the order that 
they occur. A journal is often referred to as the book of original entry because 
it’s the first place where you record transactions in the accounts.
 
Your journal doesn’t have to be a physical book. Calling it a book doesn’t 
mean you need to purchase a notebook to write down your transaction. You 
can do it on your computer. Or if you choose, you can use columnar paper 
and three-ring binders.
 
Journaling is recording transactions in a journal. Each account has a title or 
name, such as “cash,” and you record monetary increases and decreases for 
each one. Your journal entries indicate the transaction date, the names of the 
accounts involved, the amount of each debit and credit, and an explanation 

92
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
of the transaction. At the time you record journal entries, you don’t need to 
make any specific reference; just make sure you get the info recorded. See 
Chapter 5 for more about making the entries in the right accounts.
Every transaction is recorded in at least two accounts with equal debits 
and credits to keep your accounting books in balance. For example, if 
you purchase supplies for $75 on October 8, 2009, you need to record the 
transaction in two accounts. First you need to debit supplies for $75 and 
then credit cash for $75. You make the first entry in your journal.
Figure 6-2 shows a sample journal entry. (Flip to Chapter 2 for explanations of 
double-entry bookkeeping.) The following sections dive in to recording the 
actual journal entries in three easy steps.

Step one: Write the transaction date
The first step you take when making journal entries is to record the transac-
tion date. This information includes the year in small figures, the month on 
the first line, and the day. You need to know the dates that transactions took 
place to help keep your books current and up-to-date. You record journal 
entries in the order of their occurrence.

93
 Chapter 6: Recording Transactions and Journal Entries
So, for example, you receive a check for $1,000 from a donor on Oct. 8, 2010. 
Besides putting a smile on your face for receiving the money, you also need 
to deposit the check. You create the following journal entry:
  
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Oct. 8
In this journal entry, you increase your cash by $1,000 by debiting cash. And 
you increase your donations by $1,000 by crediting donations. Cash is an 
asset account. Donations are revenue accounts.
 
When recording journal entries and ledger postings, don’t use dollar signs 
because the only thing you can debit and credit to accounts is money. 
Everyone knows you’re talking about money.
Step two: Write the account names
The second step of recording your journal entries includes writing the names 
of the accounts to be debited and credited. You write the name of the 
account to be debited first, and write the name of the account to be credited 
indented about 1 inch. Doing so helps readers identify quickly which 
accounts have been debited and which have been credited. Placing the 
account to be debited first is important so other bookkeepers can follow 
your flow.
For example, to record the $1,000 donation you received, you may write the 
account names as such:
  
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Oct. 8
Cash
 
Donation Revenue
Step three: Write the amount 
of each debit and credit
In the third step, you write the debit amount in the debit column opposite 
the name of the account to be debited, and write the credit amount in the 
credit column opposite the account to be credited. So, if doing one thing to 
one side of an account increases the account, then the opposite happens 
when you record the entry on the opposite side. Asset and expense accounts 
are increased by debits; to decrease them, you credit them.

94

For example, for the $1,000 donation, record the amount as such:
  
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Oct. 8
Cash
 
Donation Revenue
1,000
1,000
Step four: Write an explanation 
or reason for transaction
Each transaction has an explanation. The final step to recording a journal 
entry is to state the reason for the transaction. Write the explanation on the 
next line, indented about 1/2 inch. Keep this explanation short and to the 
point, but be sure to include enough info to explain the transaction.
For example, in the case of the $1,000 donation, you record the following:
  
To record $1,000 individual donation from Jasmine Bentham, check #1299.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX

Donation Revenue

Leave some space between journal entries to set them apart. This space keeps 
entries from running together and makes it easier for you or someone else to 
read later.
When you’re making journal entries, usually no posting references or num-
bers are listed, but when you get ready to post to your general ledger, you’ll 
enter account numbers of the ledger accounts to which the debits and credit 
are copied. See the next section on posting to your general ledger.
Posting to the General Ledger
With bookkeeping and accounting, you want to keep track of how many 
assets you have in the different accounts in the chart of accounts (see 
Chapter 5). You keep track of this information by posting it or recording 
it in your general ledger, which is basically a group of accounts. Inside your 
general ledger are all the accounts that appear on your financial statements. 
Assets, liabilities, and net assets (statement of financial position accounts) 

95
 Chapter 6: Recording Transactions and Journal Entries
are placed first, followed by revenues and expenses (statement of activities 
accounts).
Your journal is the book of original entry. Depending on the magnitude of 
your accounting transactions, posting journal entries information from the 
journal to the ledger is usually done near the end of the day. Everything 
entered in your journal for that day should be posted to your ledger.
Accounts in the general ledger are arranged in the following order:
 
✓ Cash: This includes coins, currency, checks, money orders, checking 
and savings accounts, and short-term CDs.
 
✓ Donation receivables: They are promises and pledges to give.
 
✓ Inventory: This account records the price paid for any product sitting 
on your shelves that you plan to sell.
 
✓ Prepaid insurance: Here is what you’ve paid in advance for insurance 
coverage that expires as the days go by.
 
✓ Land: This account includes land purchased or owned by your 
organization. Although a valuable asset, land should not be depreciated 
(see Chapter 2 for more on depreciation).
 
✓ Buildings: This includes your office building if you’re buying or already 
own it. Buildings usually have a depreciable span of 39 to 40 years.
 
✓ Equipment: This account records the purchase of copy machines, 
vehicles, office furniture, file cabinets, and similar items. Equipment 
usually has a useful life span of three to seven years.
 
✓ Notes payable: These are liabilities or promises to pay a certain amount 
on a certain date.
 
✓ Accounts payable: These are short-term liabilities usually paid within a 
month or two. They’re considered a current liability.
 
✓ Salaries payable: These are usually recorded on the statement of 
financial position because employees have earned salaries but haven’t 
been paid yet.
 
✓ Mortgage payable: This is a long-term liability to a creditor for a large 
purchase of land or buildings.
 
✓ Bonds payable: This is a long-term liability between the issuer and 
lender. Some organizations borrow large sums of money to finance 
large purchases, equipment, and other assets. The money is obtained 
by issuing bonds. Bonds are paid back, and usually you have a bonds 
payable and interest payable account to account for bonds payable.
 
✓ Revenue: These accounts are established for all sources of income: 
donations, grant, fees from services rendered, and interest income. For 

96
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
most nonprofits, donations from individuals, corporations, foundations, 
and state and federal grants each are recorded in a separate account.
 
✓ Expenses: These are usually the last group of general ledger accounts. 
You name your expense accounts according to their purpose. Some 
typical expenses are rent expense, supplies expense, insurance expense, 
salaries expense, and so on.
Keep in mind the accounts in the general ledger vary from one organization 
to another. Which accounts you set up depend on
 
✓ The nature of your organization
 
✓ The way you operate
 
✓ The size of your nonprofit
 
✓ The amount of detail required by your board
 
✓ State and local laws
 
✓ Requirements by federal programs
Before you can post to your general ledger, you need to know which 
accounts are applicable to your nonprofit. Your ledger is like a master file or 
group of accounts that you record your accounting activities. To determine 
how to classify accounts, see Chapter 5.
When transferring your debit info from your journals to your general ledger, 
you post information following these steps:
 
1. Find the account name in your ledger.
 
2. Copy the date of the transaction as written in the journal to 
your ledger.
 
3. Write the debit amount as shown in the journal in your ledger.
 
4. Enter the letter G (general journal) and the journal page number 
in your ledger.
 
5. Enter the new balance after making the entry in your ledger.
 
6. Enter the account number of the account to which the amount was 
posted in your journal.
 
 This account number is a cross-reference to trace your steps. One other 
benefit to writing the account number last is it indicates that the posting 
process is complete.
 
For entering the credit entry, you perform the same steps in your ledger, just 
write the credit amount as shown in your journal.
Check out Figure 6-3 for an example of what a general ledger page looks like 
after you’ve posted your transaction from your journal.

Reaching the Trial Balance
After you post the last entries to your general ledger, it’s time to prepare a 
trial balance. Your trial balance lists all the balances of the general ledger 
accounts and totals all accounts having a debit balance and all accounts 
having a credit balance. The total debit and credit balances of each account 
in the general ledger are transferred to the trial balance. The sum of the 
debits in the trial balance must equal the sum of the credits.
The following sections walk you through creating a trial balance, help you 
make adjustments as needed to come up with the final balance, and address 
what to do when you find errors.
Preparing the trial balance: The how-to
Your trial balance is a test to see if your debits equal your credits and to 
provide evidence of accuracy in the accounts. This allows you to verify that 
your numbers are correct before you prepare your financial statements. 
Most organizations prepare a trial balance at the end of the month. Most 

98
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
accounting software on the market today doesn’t allow you to enter accounts 
that are out of balance. They’ll send a warning message when debits and 
credits don’t balance.
 
To prepare a trial balance, you write down all your account titles from your 
ledger and the debit or credit balances in each. Each time you’ve posted to 
your ledger, you’ve balanced it, so now all you need is to make a list by writing 
down those account titles and their balances. That’s it!
Understanding which accounts 
require adjustments
Two accounting principles dictate making adjustments. Adjustments are 
journal entries of changes in accounts. For example, adjustments are made 
to correct, to depreciate, and to make any changes required by an auditor.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require you to assign 
revenues to the period in which they’re earned (the realization principle). 
And expenses are reported in the same period as the revenues earned as a 
result of them when it is practical to do so, thereby matching revenues and 
expenses (the matching principle). For example, if it’s time to close your 
month or year and you have salaries that have been earned but not paid, 
you need to make adjusting entries to record that salary expense.
For example, adjusting entries are as follows:
  
To record the accrued wages.
Earned day care fees that were received in advance.

Salaries Expense
 
Salaries Payable

Unearned Daycare Fees
 
Day Care Fees Earned
125

105

In other words, revenues should be reflected on the financial statements in 
the period in which they’re earned. And expenses should be charged to the 
accounting period in which they’re incurred. Sometimes this requires making 
adjustments.

99
 Chapter 6: Recording Transactions and Journal Entries
Adjusting entries affects accounts on the statement of activities. Revenue and 
expenses accounts may require adjustments. You probably need to prepare 
adjustments for the following accounts:
 
✓ Prepaid expenses include payments in advance of use. A prepaid 
expense is considered an asset until it’s consumed in the operation of 
your business. An example of a prepaid expense is paying an insurance 
premium for a year.
 
✓ Accrued expenses are expenses incurred but not yet paid. For example, 
at the close of your accounting period, but prior to your year-end close, 
some things remain unrecorded because payment isn’t due. Examples 
of accrued expenses are utilities, telephone bills, and unpaid wages.
 
✓ Unearned revenues include payments prior to delivery of the product 
or service. This can be the sale of tickets for a benefit dinner or golf 
tournament. You may collect money weeks in advance of the event.
 
✓ Depreciation is an allocation of the purchase price of an asset based 
on its useful life. Assets are expensed over their useful life through 
depreciation. As they lose their value, a portion is written off as an 
expense.
Check out the “Correcting errors” section later in this chapter to see how 
adjustments are made to these accounts.
Finding errors
No matter how careful or meticulous you are with this accounting stuff, 
you’re going to make mistakes. There’s no way to avoid it. If you find an error 
in your trial balance, don’t despair. It happens to everyone. You know you 
have an error when your figures don’t add up when you total all debits and 
all credits that were adjusted.
 
If you know you have an error because the figures don’t add up, I suggest 
you organize all of your records (see Chapter 4 for more on the importance 
of record keeping) and then take a short break before coming back to the 
problem. Walking away from the numbers for a few minutes can give you a 
fresh outlook and help you solve the problem faster. Count to ten, take a 
restroom break, grab something to eat, and then come back to the problem.
What if you’ve re-added the numbers, pored over your paperwork, and 
checked the figures, but you still aren’t sure where the error is occurring? 
Spend some time looking over the following areas.

100
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
Ferreting out basic errors
Your general ledger is only as accurate as your journal. If you entered 
incorrect data while journaling, you probably transferred the same wrong 
information to the ledger. Go back to the beginning and compare journal 
entries to general ledger entries. If you still can’t find the error, go back over 
each transaction and look at receipts, invoices, checks, and bills. Carefully 
review each item to ensure that you recorded the correct information in your 
journal and in your ledger.
 
If you find that your trial balance is still out of balance and the difference is 
evenly divisible by 9, you’ve made a transposition error. A transposition error 
occurs when you switch the order of the digits. You write 428 instead of 482, 
for example (see Chapter 7 for more on detecting these mistakes).
Even if your accounting system is computerized, you or one of your staff 
members has to enter the numbers. Every once in a while, the person 
entering the information makes a mistake that throws things off. One of the 
objectives of an audit is to find or detect errors that have a material effect on 
an organization’s financial statements. Do the following to locate errors:
 
✓ Refer back to your journal and check the posting and totals
 
✓ Check the posting and balances in your general ledger accounts
 
✓ Check all balances in the trial balance
Being aware of hidden errors
Keep in mind that some errors can’t be detected. For example, if you forget 
to record a transaction, or if you copy the incorrect debit amount and credit 
amount in accounts, it’s highly unlikely these would be found.
Some errors cancel each other out. If you make a $1,000 error twice, the 
two may cancel each other out. Or you may make an error by debiting the 
wrong account within the same account group. For example, if you charge 
something to Vehicle Expense that should have been charged to Office 
Supplies, you probably wouldn’t detect this error. However, your auditor 
probably will detect material amounts. He’ll also define for you what’s 
considered material for your nonprofit.
 
One way to reduce the chance of errors like these is to create a monthly trial 
balance. Tracking your accounts by creating a monthly trial balance can save 
you lots of time and energy. If you keep everything in balance month by 
month, you’ll breeze through the final process at the end of the year. (See 
Chapter 19 for more on closing the year-end books.)

101
 Chapter 6: Recording Transactions and Journal Entries
Correcting errors
So after hunting through your transactions, you find your error. Although 
some errors are easier to find than others, most are easily correctible. Errors 
made in calculations and balancing, posting to the wrong side of an account, 
entering the wrong amounts, or simply forgetting to enter a transaction can 
be easily corrected. The trial balance shows these errors pretty quickly. How 
you correct the error depends on whether it’s in the journal and the general 
ledger or in your journal only.
Making a journal correction
Depending on where and when you find an error in the journal affects how 
you correct it. Usually you can correct it by drawing a line through the error 
and writing the correct amount or title above the error. If the data has been 
journalized and not posted to the general ledger, that’s all you have to do.
For example, say you see the following entry in your journal:
  
To record the purchase of office supplies.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Oct. 8
Office Furniture and Fixtures
 
Cash
75
75
If you made the previous entry when you purchased office supplies on Oct 8, 
then the following entry is needed to correct the error.
  
To correct entry of Oct 8 when the Office Furniture and 
Fixtures account was debited in error instead of 
Office Supplies.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Oct. 8
Office Supplies 
 
Office Furniture and Fixtures
75
75
The debit to Office Supplies records the purchase in the right account and 
the credit to Office Furniture and Fixtures cancels out the error of the first 
entry. There’s no need to bother with cash, because it was handled properly.

102
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
If the incorrect information from the journal has already been recorded in the 
ledger, you have to take a few more steps to make everything right. I explain 
how in the next section.
Making a ledger correction
If you find a mistake after it’s been posted to the ledger, you need to 
correct the journal and ledger entry to fix the problem. For example, if you 
purchased something for cash and you accidently recorded it as an Accounts 
Payable, by making the following entry
  
To record the purchase of office supplies.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Aug. 14
Office Supplies
 
Accounts Payable
50

To correct this error the following entry is required:
  
To correct an error in the entry of Aug. 14 in which office 
supplies purchased for cash was recorded to Accounts 
Payable.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Aug. 31
Accounts Payable
 
Cash

After you record adjusting journal entries in the journal, you have to post to 
the accounts in the general ledger, just like the earlier journal entries. It’s the 
same process — journal first and then post to the ledger.

Donations and Expenses

▶ The dreaded chore: Paying bills and recording expenses
▶ Performing checks and balances: Reconciling your checkbook register
▶ When things don’t add up: Ferreting out and fixing errors
T
he center of every transaction in nonprofit organizations starts and ends 
in the checkbook register. In fact, you can find the keys that unlock your 
nonprofit’s financial position in the checkbook register and bank statements. 
Having more money than you thought you had in your checking account is 
okay, but having less money can cost you if a check bounces.
The bank records every donation deposited and expense paid out of your 
checking account and sends you a monthly statement showing this activity. 
All deposits are considered credits (additions) to your account, and all with-
drawals are considered debits (subtractions). The difference between credits 
and debits equals your checking account balance.
Having a checking account saves you time and energy. For example, driv-
ing to each utility to pay your bill in cash would take a lot of time away from 
bigger duties — serving your community. It makes it easier for bookkeeping 
and record keeping if you pay bills out of a checking account instead of using 
cash. That’s why organization is a must. Having a plan to track all donations 
and expenses is essential; if you don’t have a plan, you’ll inevitably run into 
major problems because you won’t know whether you have enough money to 
cover your expenses and pay your bills.
Writing a check creates a paper trail between your checkbook, the bank, 
and the vendor or bill you’re paying. It’s easier to trace your steps when you 
have a bank that provides a bank statement. This paper trail comes in handy 
during your nonprofit’s audit.

104
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
This chapter focuses on how to use the checkbook register to balance your 
nonprofit’s checking account and shows you how to record and log transac-
tions when they occur.
 
If you just opened a checking account, balancing the account in your head 
may seem like a practical approach when only a few transactions are taking 
place. Don’t rely on this system as an adequate method. You’ll regret it later. 
Not balancing your checkbook can cost you returned check fees and overdraft 
fees, and cause you to lose your credibility.
Getting the Lowdown on 
Your Checkbook Register
Before you can balance your nonprofit’s checkbook register, you first need to 
know what the register is. You’re probably familiar with your personal check-
ing account register. In fact, you’ve probably been annoyed at the supermar-
ket while you waited in line as someone writes in her checkbook register. 
However annoying she may be, she’s recording the check amount to keep 
track of her money. With your nonprofit’s checking account, the checkbook 
register holds valuable information.
You use a checkbook register to record the following:
 
✓ Each check when written
 
✓ Each deposit when made
 
✓ Each withdrawal either from an ATM or at a teller window
 
✓ All bank service charges
Figure 7-1 shows you an example of a checkbook register for a fictional non-
profit organization. In this figure you can see entries for the transactions 
that take place in the checking account. The rest of this chapter discusses 
how you record information in your register to balance your nonprofit’s 
checkbook.
 
Duplicate checks can be a lifesaver when it comes to recording information in 
your checkbook register. Duplicate checks create a copy of a check as you fill 
it out so you have all the details of the check after you hand it over to pay for 
something. These nifty copies help you stay on top of your account balance 
because you can look at the copies and transfer the transaction information to 
your register.

105
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
 
Figure 7-1: 
A nonprofit’s 
checkbook 
register.
 
 
Another lifesaver to keeping your register balanced is online banking. You can 
see an updated and current balance in your account when you access your 
account online. Online banking gives you a heads-up. But even with online bank-
ing, you still need a paper trail because one day you may be audited, and you’ll 
need to have all deposits and withdrawals from your checking account recorded 
in the check register. Even if you’re not a number cruncher, you still need to keep 
a checkbook register because you need to stay on top of your finances.
Adding and Tracking 
Nonprofit Donations
To have a complete picture of how much money your nonprofit has on hand, 
you want to keep an accurate picture of the money coming in. Most of what 
comes in is in the form of donations (charitable contributions that individu-
als as well as organizations give to your nonprofit). Your nonprofit may have 
other sources of income (check out the nearby sidebar “Identifying other 
potential income sources” for more info). However, you mainly deposit cash 
donations into your checking account.
Most of your donations may come in the form of checks written by donors, 
foundations, and corporations. Keeping track of those donations and deposit-
ing them into your checking account is important because you want to make 
deposits in a timely fashion so the money is available to support your orga-
nization. If you don’t deposit a donor’s check right away, it may bounce. It’s 
best to deposit all checks right away so they can clear the donor’s account, 
allowing your nonprofit to avoid unnecessary bank fees.

106
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
The following sections focus on how to log monetary donations into your 
checking account, the different types of donations you may encounter, and 
why you need to differentiate between them.
Logging donations in your register
As your nonprofit receives donations, you need to make sure you write them 
down (or log them) in your checkbook register as soon as you deposit them. 
Keeping your checkbook register current is necessary to avoid overdraft fees (fees 
the bank charges you when you write a check for more money than you have in 
your account) and to stay on top of your organization’s income and expenses.
For example, if you don’t record a deposit, you may put off making an impor-
tant purchase because you think you don’t have the money (when in fact you 
do). Or if you incorrectly record a deposit, such as writing $2,850 when the 
deposit was actually $285, you may end up being charged an overdraft fee if 
you write a check for more money than you have in your account.
 
To record your deposits in your checkbook register, you enter the date, the 
source of the deposit, and the amount of the transaction in the corresponding 
columns. In the checkbook register in Figure 7-1, you have three deposits. The 
first deposit of $500 was made on October 1, 2009; the second deposit for $750 
was made on October 8; and the third deposit for $300 was made on October 
13. The total of your deposits is $1,550.
Identifying other potential income sources
Your nonprofit can collect revenue from more 
than a dozen sources. The most common include 
contributions, corporate and foundation grants, 
government grants, government contracts, mem-
bership dues, interest on savings and temporary 
cash investments, dividends and interest from 
marketable securities, rental income, gains or 
losses on the sale of investments, special events, 
and so on. Although you have many potential 
income sources and you can’t operate without 
income, you have to be careful how you gener-
ate income to sustain yourself.
I know you have to have income to keep your 
nonprofit operating, and I know you may be 
tempted to come up with a money-making 
venture to keep your nonprofit operating at 
maximum capacity. But be careful not to earn 
too much money by doing things outside the 
scope of your purpose. When you step outside 
your scope and purpose by generating income 
unrelated to your purpose, you may have to pay 
income taxes.
Income unrelated to your purpose is called 
unrelated business income (UBI), and there’s a tax 
form to go with it — Form 990-T. For more about 
unrelated business income, see Chapter 14.

107
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
Raking in the cash, checks, 
and other donations
People can write checks, hand you cash, or pay by credit card when they 
donate money to your organization. Larger groups may give you a grant to 
finance your mission. No matter what form the donations take, you need 
to know the type of donation they are before you can record them in your 
checkbook register. This section takes a closer look at the different types of 
donations that you need to record as deposits.
 
In addition to tracking donations, you need to keep a list of donors. The 
donors list should include donors’ names and addresses, and amount 
donated. You’ll need this list for information purposes and to track your dona-
tions. Your auditor will use your donors list to randomly verify donations 
received (see Chapter 20).
Cash donations
Although cash donations are probably the most common type of donation 
your nonprofit receives, cash is also one of the hardest types of donations 
to track. Cash, a problem? Cash can present a problem because it’s so easily 
transferable without leaving a paper trail.
Searching for the right bank
Shopping for and finding a bank that addresses 
your nonprofit’s needs is especially important. 
You want a bank that will honor your status as 
a nonprofit organization by waiving checking 
account fees. In today’s market, banks are com-
petitive, so if you do your research, you can find 
one that will benefit your nonprofit the most.
So what should you look for in a bank? Ask 
yourself what’s important for your nonprofit. 
One important factor to consider is how much 
activity you transact within a given month. Pay 
attention to banks that offer free services up to 
a minimum number of transactions, and then 
charge $1 per transaction thereafter. However, 
if you make lots of deposits and use your bank 
card daily, you may end up paying your bank too 
much. The bank I use for my nonprofit’s check-
ing account doesn’t charge me service fees or 
fees for online banking.
Many banks offer overdraft protection — where 
the bank will pay the check if you overdraw your 
account. This can save you some embarrass-
ment and some money, not to mention overdraft 
fees from the merchant and the bank. Talk with 
your banker about overdraft protection.
Online banking is an excellent way to keep an 
eye on your bank account. You need to keep an 
eye on your checking account because banks 
make mistakes too. Find out if online banking is 
free before you sign up for it.

The best way to handle a cash donation is to give the donor a receipt if the 
donation is made in your office. If you receive cash in the mail, you should 
send the donor a receipt. You don’t want to turn down cash just because it’s 
hard to track, but your nonprofit should have some checks and balances in 
place to properly account for cash donations. (See Chapter 2 for more on set-
ting up checks and balances.)
For example, what if someone walks into your organization and gives a $1,000 
cash donation to your receptionist? What procedures do you have in place 
to ensure the money is reported? Although you hope everyone in your office 
is honest, you also know people face hardships in life, and sometimes the 
temptation to pocket the money is too great. If the receptionist is in the office 
alone, what happens if she decides to borrow it until payday? When payday 
comes, the receptionist decides to wait until next payday. What started out 
as a mere loan has turned into a pile of debt, and no one knows about it but 
the receptionist.
Donations made by check
A big chunk of your donations probably come in the form of a check. 
Although these are more secure than cash donations, they can be tedious to 
process. (See the “Handling and recording the donations” section for more 
about depositing donations.)
 
Watch out for bad checks. Be prepared because donors will write you checks 
that they don’t have enough funds in their checking accounts to cover. The 
best way to stay on top of knowing whether you’ve received a bad check is to 
review your account online. Even then it may take a few days before you know 
whether a check has cleared. It may appear that you have a good working bal-
ance in your checkbook register because people have been giving and you’ve 
recorded the donations as deposits. But don’t count your chicks before they 
hatch. Until those checks clear your bank, don’t count them as available cash.
Protecting your cash
While working for a doctor a few years ago, 
I noticed that patients were paying their bills 
with cash. I knew the doctor couldn’t watch the 
cash and take care of the patients, so I put a 
control system in place.
First, I bought a duplicate cash receipt book. 
Second, I placed a sign on the wall by the cash 
drawer that stated, “If you don’t get a receipt, 
then your services are free.” You know the 
patients were watching and waiting to not get a 
receipt. So the patients took care of this one.
In addition, I wrote down the beginning-of-the-day 
and end-of-the-day cash balances. Then I sub-
tracted the beginning-of-the-day balance from the 
end-of-the-day balance. The difference was how 
much we had taken in during the day. The copies 
of the receipts should add up to this amount. This 
simple procedure can help you track your cash.

109
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
 
If you can afford it, purchase a check-swiping system, such as TeleCheck, to 
speed up the checking-clearing process. These systems are connected directly 
to banks and reject a check if the money isn’t in the account. This is the best 
way to avoid delays in waiting for checks to clear your bank account. This 
is the same system used by some of the large retail stores. You’ve probably 
written a check at a store and handed it to the clerk, who swipes the check 
through a machine and gives it back to you. You can do the same for checks 
written to your agency. The cost of the terminal and printer runs between 
$399 and $999. Plus, you’ll pay transaction fees and monthly customer service 
fees. For more about quick check-clearing processing, visit the following Web 
site: www.instamerchant.com/check-guarantee.html.
Credit card donations
Credit card donations are another popular way you receive donations. 
However, when reporting these donations, you need to know that when 
someone donates $1,000 on his credit card, you don’t receive $1,000. So you 
can’t record credit card donations for the total amount donated. The major 
credit card companies — American Express, Discover Card, MasterCard, and 
Visa — all charge a user fee or percentage for processing the payment. When 
a donor contributes to your organization by swiping his credit card, you’re 
not going to get the total amount.
For example, when you swipe a donor’s credit card, the bank takes 1 to 5 per-
cent of the amount donated as its processing fee. If a donor uses his credit 
card to give you a $100 donation and the bank charges a 2 percent fee, you 
only receive $98 in your bank account. The donor has given a $100 donation, 
but you have to pay a $2 bank fee.
 
Don’t count credit card donations before they clear the bank. The credit card 
company may reject the payment and cause you to overdraw your checking 
account. The amount of time it takes for the transaction to clear your bank 
depends on your bank, the credit card company, and the day of the week. 
Some transactions are transmitted, posted, and delivered to your account 
within minutes, while others take a bit longer. You can always call your bank 
to check the status of credit card donations.
Direct bank draft donations
Direct bank draft donations allow people to donate a large sum of money 
broken into smaller amounts over a longer period of time. Each month the 
employer takes the designated amount out of an employee’s paycheck as 
a payroll deduction and sends the money to the nonprofit. These types of 
donations are a win-win; the donor can make small donations that add up 
over time without feeling a big difference in take-home pay, and the nonprofit 
receives a donation that’s often larger than a one-time donation would be. 
Some of the larger nonprofits, like United Way, do direct bank drafts from 
employees’ pay.

110
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
This method results in the deposit going directly into your bank account 
around the same day of each month. You need to pay attention to the timing 
of these deposits so you can record them in your checkbook register on the 
right day.
 
Banks don’t record deposits on weekends or holidays. Keeping this in mind 
can help you with the timing differences and help to keep everything in bal-
ance. When the deposit date falls on a nonbusiness day, the bank will make 
the deposit according to its policy, which usually is the next business day.
Grants
A grant affords your organization large sums of money that you don’t have 
to pay back. Some foundations and corporations donate grant money in the 
form of a check, while some government grants reimburse you by direct 
deposit after the money is spent. No matter how you receive the grant 
money, remember that a good steward manages grant money by tracking and 
monitoring how the money is used. For more information about managing 
grants, see Chapter 11.
All contributions received from the grant should be deposited into your bank 
account and recorded in your checkbook register. Make a copy of the check 
before you deposit it; don’t just cash it. Some people open a new account 
just to manage the grant, but this is up to you. Whether to open a separate 
account depends on how much money the grant is for and how likely it is 
that you’ll have problems keeping transactions separate.
Handling and recording the donations
When you receive donations, you need to properly track and record them. 
You want to ensure you create a paper trail that leads back to the donors list 
for auditing purposes. You want to get those donations in your bank account 
and write your donor a thank-you letter. Make sure you do the following:
 
1. At the end of the day, add all the donations you received during the 
day. Record the amounts on a bank deposit slip.
 
 If the money came from a new donor, add the person to your donors 
list. If the donation came from an established donor, open the donor’s 
account and record the new donation.
 
2. Make copies of the checks and deposit slip before you deposit the checks.
 
 Because banks make mistakes every day, it’s important for you to keep 
track of every deposit made to your account. Keep copies of the depos-
ited checks and deposit slips in a safe place so when the bank sends the 
monthly bank statement, you have proof of deposit. This is very impor-
tant if you make deposits after banking hours through night depositories.

111
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
 
3. Write down the deposit in your checkbook register.
 
 Not writing down a deposit can throw your checking account out of 
whack. Forgetting to write down a deposit is not as bad as forgetting to 
write down a written check.
 
4. Take the checks and the deposit slip to the bank and make the deposit.
 
 If you have a high volume of checks coming in for large amounts, you 
don’t want to keep them at your office any longer than necessary. Your 
bank has a night deposit box that you can use to make your deposits 
after hours. This requires a trip the next day to pick up the deposit slip 
and bank bag, but it may be worth the trouble. Plus, keeping checks at 
your location for extended periods of time isn’t a good idea. You open 
yourself up for possible robbery or some other unforeseen event.
At the end of the month, you can compare your records against the bank’s 
records. You’ll receive a bank statement that lists all the transactions made 
on your account. This statement makes it easier for bookkeepers to track the 
transactions that the bank received and serves as a checkpoint. Just eyeball-
ing this statement isn’t enough; you should use the statement to balance your 
checkbook register (see the “Tie It Together: Balancing the Checkbook” section).
Subtracting Your Expenses
To balance your checkbook, not only do you need to record and add all 
donations (as the previous section explains), but you also need to record 
and subtract all expenses. Every check you write to pay a bill is an expense; if 
you don’t carefully record all these expenses, your checking account balance 
won’t be accurate, and you may end up overdrawing your account.
The following sections take a closer look at the types of expenses you need 
to subtract from your checkbook register and how to record the transactions 
in your register. By paying close attention to this information, you can get a 
clearer picture of how much money is in your checking account.
Making the necessary deductions 
in your checkbook register
Receiving bills each month is like death and taxes. They’re inevitable. When 
you receive them, you can’t ignore them. You have to pay them and record 
them in your checkbook register right away. If you forget to record just one 
transaction, you can throw your account out of balance and end up paying 
unnecessary bank fees.

112
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
For example, you have $1,840 in your checking account, and you have to 
write checks to cover your utilities for $300, your rent for $1,000, and your 
insurance for $300. You subtract each check from your total; now you 
know you have $240 in your account. If you don’t write down one of these 
expenses, such as the insurance bill, you’ll think you have $540 in your 
account, which may cause you to write a check for $500 to cover your car 
payment. Doing so results in an overdraft and potential costly overdraft fees.
 
After you pay the expenses, make sure you log them in your checkbook regis-
ter. Doing so keeps your checkbook register current.
To record your expenses in your checkbook register, you simply log them in 
as you write the checks. For example, Figure 7-1 shows that check 255 was 
written for $100 to George Rembert to purchase supplies; check 256 was for 
$25 to pay the web designer; and check 257 was for $925 for salaries payable. 
You list each piece of information for the transaction in its own column: date, 
check number, payee, and withdrawal/payment. For each amount, you sub-
tract it from the running balance in the last column labeled “Balance.”
Now, suppose you had to pay your $1,500 insurance bill, but you forgot to log 
in the $100 check written to George Rembert. Your account balance would 
show $1,542, and you’d think you had just enough money to pay your insur-
ance. As you can see from the account balance, you only have $1,442 in your 
account. If you forget to log in a check for even $100, it can put your account 
into overdraft.
 
In addition to keeping track of checks you’ve written, you also need to keep 
track of expenses associated with the use of a check or debit card. Most of 
the time when you open a checking account, the bank sends you a check 
card. Because they look like credit cards, these cards can cause you to forget 
to track expenses associated with their use. The bank card can be used as a 
credit card or a debit card. A fee is usually charged to your account for using 
it as a debit card, so you need to know the fees associated with each type of 
use. Don’t forget to write down these fees to keep your balance current.
Identifying common expenses
As much as you may want to, you can’t avoid the dreaded cycle of paying 
your nonprofit’s bills. In fact, it may seem like every time you open your mail-
box, you have at least one rearing its ugly head.
You need to have a clear grasp of the types of bills your nonprofit may 
receive so you know what needs to be deducted from your check register. 
Some common expenses paid out of your checkbook are:

113
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
 
✓ Rent: This is an expense for your office space or building that you’re 
leasing.
 
✓ Utilities: These include telephone, fax, electricity, water, garbage, and 
so on.
 
✓ Payroll/wages: These are expenses in paying those who provide a 
service.
 
✓ Payroll taxes (federal, state, Medicare, Social Security taxes): These 
are expenses that are reported, deducted, and must be paid, if appli-
cable, to federal and state governments.
 
✓ Contract labor: This expense is used when additional help is needed 
and a contract is issued and signed for a specific time to complete the 
task at hand.
 
✓ Travel expenses: These expenses occur from going to and from different 
destinations. They include transportation and lodging, as well as meals.
 
✓ Licenses and permits: These are expenses for your nonprofit licenses 
and permits that allow you to operate and be recognized as a nonprofit 
organization in your state, county, and city municipalities.
 
✓ Insurance: This expense is a necessary component to protect you, your 
clients, your board, and your organization from potential hazards that 
could be disastrous to your nonprofit.
 
✓ Office expenses and supplies: These include paper, pens, and other 
small-ticket items, including postage and printing-related supplies.
 
✓ Office furniture: This is usually for desks, chairs, and tables.
 
✓ Computer hardware and software: The category includes computers 
and software used to help you in run your nonprofit.
 
✓ Internet Web site expenses: This expense may include Web page 
design, domain name fee, the maintenance and updates of your Web 
page, and the storing and processing of Web page data.
 
✓ Bank service fees: Banks are competitive, and most allow you to have 
a free checking account because you’re a nonprofit organization. This 
doesn’t mean you get your checks for free, but you won’t be charged 
a fee for the account. Pay attention to the hidden banking fees. Other 
types of bank fees include the following:
 
• Credit card processing: These fees may be charged by your bank-
ing institute for handling monies deposited and withdrawn with 
credit cards.
 
• Transaction fees: These are fees for using a check card or debit 
card rather than writing checks to make purchases.

114
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
• Non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees: Your bank charges these fees for 
processing a check or credit card transaction when the money 
wasn’t available in your account. This is commonly referred to as a 
bounced check.
 
• Fee per transaction: These fees may be charged if you go over the 
amount of transactions designated by your bank. Some banks offer 
free checking with a maximum of 25 transactions. With the 26th 
transaction, you may be charged $1 per transaction thereafter.
 
• ATM user fees: If you use an ATM owned by a different bank, you 
may be charged. These expenses can range from $1 to $3 per 
transaction.
 
✓ Electronic payment fees: Receiving and paying bills electronically is 
part of the going-green concept. It not only offers convenience, but 
it saves the environment when you receive your bills in your e-mail 
account versus in the mailbox. Electronic billing is faster than traditional 
mail and saves time and energy.
 
 To avoid these fees, I steer away from companies that charge to do 
online payments. For those companies, I use the old-fashioned, albeit 
slower, method — the mailman.
 
 If you do choose to pay your bills electronically, either directly through 
the utility or through your bank, watch out for utility bills that go up and 
down during the year. Not knowing how much will be drafted from your 
checking account is tricky business.
 
 As a general rule, most people don’t keep a lot of extra money in their 
checking account. If your utility costs are up and down, then you must 
keep an adequate amount in your account to cover the differences.
 
✓ Building security expenses: This expense may include security cameras 
and security guards, as well as security alarm system installation and 
monthly access fees.
 
✓ Miscellaneous expenses: Any fee not listed in the preceding categories 
that only occurs occasionally or is incidental may be classified as a 
miscellaneous expense. For example, this may be the tip you give for 
prompt delivery of your new computer system or some other small, non-
essential expense.
 
Be careful with bills that aren’t a fixed amount each month. For example, 
because the price of natural gas is up, I opted for the budget plan for the gas 
bill. The budget plan means I pay the same amount for gas year round, elimi-
nating really high or really low bills throughout the year.

115
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
Relying on direct or automatic bank drafts
To prevent potential errors, you can set up automatic or direct bank drafts 
with your checking account. Automatic or direct bank drafts are bills that are 
paid directly out of your checking account on the same date every month. 
You should consider direct drafts for bills that are the same amount each 
month, because bills that fluctuate in balance can do a number on your 
checking account.
 
For example, a few years ago I had direct bank draft for my gas bill. Before the 
price of oil went sky high, my gas bill was averaging $40 a month. In December 
2005, my gas bill went up to $289.41. That’s nearly a $250 difference. The gas 
company took $289.41 out of my account when I was expecting a debit of 
about $40.
Using automatic bank drafts has a few advantages and disadvantages. Some 
of the advantages are:
 
✓ You save time by not having to write a check.
 
✓ You save money by not having to buy stamps.
 
✓ You save time and money by not going to the post office.
 
✓ You save time by not having to remember to pay the bill.
Because direct drafts are automatic, they pose the following disadvantages:
 
✓ You may forget to record and deduct the draft in your checkbook 
register.
 
✓ You may forget to make sure you have enough money in your account to 
cover the payment.
 
✓ If you don’t have enough money to cover the draft, you may be hit with 
an overdraft fee on your account.
 
I wouldn’t advise doing a direct draft for bills that may fluctuate considerably. 
For example, it’s probably safer to have a landline phone bill come directly out 
of your checking account than a cellphone bill.
 
It’s a good idea to subtract direct drafts on your check register at the begin-
ning of the month. If you’re really organized, you can make a note to record 
the draft when the payment is scheduled to be made directly from your 
account. Forgetting to log in these expenses can put your organization’s 
finances in a whirlwind.

Tie It Together: Balancing the Checkbook
Most nonprofits hire a bookkeeper to handle the day-to-day finances of the 
organization and a part-time accountant to tie it all together. Bookkeepers 
and accountants perform different duties. A good bookkeeper captures 
everything needed for the accountant to put together your financial reports 
(see Chapter 2 for more on bookkeeper and accountant duties).
No matter whether you’re doing the bookkeeping yourself or you have some-
one else do it, this section gives you two ways you can ensure your books are 
balanced and your nonprofit is tracking and recording donations the right 
way. The bottom line: You need to know what’s going on financially with your 
nonprofit’s checking account. You do so by tracking donations and expenses 
carefully. Doing so can save you time later when filing reports to the IRS, your 
nonprofit’s board of directors, and auditors.
 
Don’t allow a lot of time to pass without reconciling your checkbook register 
to your bank statement. Banks have a set amount of time to make good on 
their mistakes. Waiting too long can cause you to lose money.
 
To help you reconcile your account, I suggest ordering duplicate checks or 
choosing a bank that sends copies of each check. The more records you have 
as documentation, the easier it is to get everything to balance.
Using the bank statement
At the end of the month, your bank sends you a bank statement. The bank 
statement contains a list of deposits and withdrawals (whether cash you’ve 
taken out or checks you’ve written) that have been made to your account. 
The statement also has a handy-dandy worksheet on the back to help you 
reconcile the differences between what the bank shows in its records versus 
what’s in your checkbook register. You want to compare the balance you 
have in your checkbook register with the balance on the bank statement.
Unfortunately these two figures probably aren’t going to be the same. You 
need to make sure you know how much money is in your nonprofit’s account. 
To do so, you reconcile. To reconcile your checking account means to 
account for the differences between the bank statement and your checkbook 
register. Follow these steps to reconcile:
 
1. Compare your bank statement to your checkbook register to figure 
out which checks have cleared your account and which haven’t. Put a 
checkmark next to the checks that have cleared.
 
 A check has cleared when the money has been moved from your account 
to the payee’s account.

117
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
 
2. Repeat Step 1 for your deposits.
 
3. Repeat Step 1 for withdrawals and debit card purchases.
 
 If the bank shows something that isn’t listed in your checkbook register, 
check your records to make sure you made the transaction. If you did make 
the purchase and forgot to record it, write it in now. If you didn’t make the 
transaction, call your bank and ask for more information about it.
 
4. Repeat Step 1 for any bank fees or interest the account may have paid 
or earned.
 
5. List the outstanding checks on a separate piece of paper. Also list any 
outstanding withdrawals and debit card purchases. Add the numbers.
 
 When a check or other transaction is outstanding, it hasn’t cleared the 
bank yet. You know which transactions are outstanding because they 
are the ones you didn’t put a checkmark by in Steps 1, 2, and 3.
 
6. List any outstanding deposits. Add the numbers.
 
7. Write down the ending balance shown on your bank statement.
 
8. Subtract the amount of outstanding checks and withdrawals that you 
came up with in Step 5 from the ending balance you wrote down in 
Step 7.
 
9. Add the amount of outstanding deposits you came up with in Step 6.
 
 After completing Steps 8 and 9, your total should match the balance in 
your checkbook register.
 
10. If the number you came up with in Step 9 doesn’t match the number 
in your checkbook register, you have some sleuthing to do.
 
 Double-check your math in your checkbook register; make sure you’ve 
accounted for all checks, deposits, withdrawals, and fees in your check-
book register; go through Steps 1 through 9 again to make sure you 
didn’t leave anything out or do the math incorrectly.
 
If your bank statement comes in the mail, you can use the handy worksheet on 
the back of the statement to balance your checkbook. It has a grid and instruc-
tions (similar to the ones I present here) that walk you through the process.
 
When reconciling your account, you should rely more heavily on your own records 
than the bank’s. The bank statement only covers a set time period; your records 
are current and up-to-date because you have been tracking every transaction. 
The following transactions can make it difficult to balance your checkbook:
 
✓ Checks written but not yet cleared (see the “Considering outstanding 
checks” section later in this chapter).
 
✓ Online bill-pay transaction fees. Sometimes utility companies charge 
a fee to process online payments. It’s easy to forget to record these in 
your register.

118
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
✓ ATM/debit card transactions and fees. You may have recent transac-
tions that occurred between the time the statement was printed 
and now.
 
✓ Deposits made or recorded after the statement date.
 
✓ Bank fees and earned interest not recorded in the checkbook.
Entering the information into QuickBooks
If you’re a techie kind of person, consider using the software program 
QuickBooks for Nonprofit Organizations for help with your nonprofit book-
keeping and accounting needs. QuickBooks can help you with payroll, check 
writing, accepting credit card payments, and accurately completing and 
demonstrating financial accountability. It also can help you balance your non-
profit’s checkbook.
With QuickBooks you skip all the manual steps taken to track and manage 
your nonprofit finances. For more information about QuickBooks, see 
Chapter 4 or go to www.qbalance.com.
 
You can buy QuickBooks software to download on your computer for under 
$200. The same company that developed QuickBooks also developed Turbo 
Tax. This means it’s easy to convert your day-to-day bookkeeping and 
accounting records to financial statements and IRS reports.
Smoothing Out and Avoiding Errors
As careful as you are when recording your donations and expenses, and rec-
onciling your checkbook to bank statements, sometimes errors will happen. 
A few simple tricks can help you lower the chances of having errors. The fol-
lowing sections explain what to do if you encounter an error and offer some 
suggestions about how to lower the odds of errors.
Finding and addressing errors
Errors made when writing down numbers are called transposition errors. 
These errors can drive you crazy because it looks like the numbers are 
adding up correctly, but they aren’t. You add the numbers once and get one 
amount ($859.89), but when you add them again to double-check the math, 
you get a different amount ($859.98). See how tricky those two numbers 

119
 Chapter 7: Balancing the Checkbook: Donations and Expenses
are? Somewhere along the line you may have written down the digits you’re 
adding in the wrong order (or entered them in the wrong order if you’re 
using a calculator or adding machine).
 
To figure out whether an error is caused by transposing digits and not incor-
rect math, find the difference of the two sums. If it’s evenly divisible by 9, 
you know you have a transposition error. So when you subtract $859.98 and 
$859.89, you get $0.09. Because that amount is evenly divisible by 9, you know 
you’ve got a transposition error within the numbers you added to reach the 
total.
To avoid these kinds of errors, take your time when writing down and 
adding numbers. A 10-key adding machine can be useful when checking your 
math. It gives you a tape of what you keyed in. You can also use a computer 
spreadsheet to check figures. The old pencil-and-paper method is still a good 
one to use.
 
If you’ve checked and can’t find the difference, consider the following 
suggestions:
 
✓ Ask someone else to look at the numbers. A fresh set of eyes may be 
able to find the problem.
 
✓ Call your bank and ask for help. Because the management values you 
as a customer, someone will help you.
Considering outstanding checks
You can also prevent errors in your nonprofit’s check register by being aware 
of outstanding checks. Outstanding checks are checks you’ve written that 
haven’t cleared the bank yet. Your bank only records the checks that have 
been paid out of your account. Your bank doesn’t know about the checks 
you’ve written but it hasn’t received yet. These checks haven’t made it to 
your bank, so they aren’t reflected in the bank’s balance of your account.
To avoid outstanding checks from being a problem, make sure you keep 
up with your own balance and check your records against the bank’s every 
month. It’s your responsibility to manage your money and account for all 
expenses as accurately as possible. Staying on top of outstanding checks is 
important to accurately account for all transactions.
 
Some organizations hold on to checks for long periods of time before deposit-
ing them. If you’re not keeping track of your own account, when these checks 
hit your account, checks could start bouncing.

120
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
Some banks have time restraints on how long a check can be held before 
cashing. Some are only good for 90 days, but you should find out from your 
bank how long it will honor payments on checks. You may want to consider 
printing “Void after 6 months” on your checks to avoid problems with old 
outstanding checks.
 
Some banks cash checks without even looking at the date. Regardless of when 
the check is cashed, you owed someone something, and that’s the reason the 
check was written. Overlooking outstanding checks can put you in a financial 
bind. Talk with your banker about overdraft protection to alleviate the fees 
associated with a bounced check.
When considering outstanding checks, you also need to account for the 
timing difference in available funds. For example, when you deposit money, it 
may not be available for a day or two, but when you write a check, the money 
is gone within a day, if not instantly. So you have to make sure that when you 
pay bills you have enough money to cover them. Make a note of when you 
expect the check to clear and pay close attention to see when it clears.

Balancing Cash Flow: Creating 
an Operating Budget
In This Chapter
▶ Outlining your nonprofit’s goals
▶ Projecting and comparing revenues and expenses
▶ Sticking to your plan
Your organization needs to know where it’s going, whether you put it in 
writing or not. However, to spend money without thinking or planning 
indicates a lack of control and responsibility. A budget helps you manage 
your money and prioritize your spending, and also serves as a checkpoint to 
impulsive buying. It shows revenues and the amount set aside for planned 
expenses. To keep track of your money, you need a budget to keep cash flow 
in balance.
Basically your budget is your organization’s financial plan. Without a detailed 
budget, your nonprofit’s risk of failure increases significantly. Not to worry 
though. This chapter explains why your nonprofit needs a budget, what you 
need to do to create a budget, and how to create, track, manage, and evaluate 
your financial plan.
Eyeing the Importance of Having 
a Budget in the Nonprofit World
For your nonprofit to survive and thrive financially, you must create and 
follow a budget. In fact, it really can be life or death for your organization. A 
budget is an itemized list of what income you have and expect to receive and 
what you expect to pay out during a given time period, whether a month, 

122
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
quarter, or year. It expresses in monetary terms what your objectives are. It’s 
almost impossible to know when you’ve reached your target goal if you don’t 
know what you need.
 
Without a budget, you’re on a cross-country road trip without a map. If you 
start out on a trip with no planned destination, who knows where you’ll end 
up. Your nonprofit is too important to allow things to just happen to it. You 
need to control as much about your finances as you can. A budget can tell you
 
✓ How much cash you need now and in the future to meet payroll and 
other expenses
 
✓ How much cash you have readily available in your bank accounts
 
✓ How much money you’re expecting to receive from fundraisers and 
grants
 
✓ How much money you need to borrow
 
✓ How much in stocks or bonds to sell
 
✓ How much you need every month, quarter, and year for operating 
expenses
Operating on a budget is important at all times, not just when money is tight. 
Following your budget means you’re planning for income and expenses and 
controlling your money. Your budget is a prediction or forecast (not the 
kind you get from a crystal ball) based on prior events and expected future 
events. Not only does a budget include projections, but after time expires, 
you have the reality of what actually happened.
You can use your budget to cut costs and run your organization more 
efficiently. It’s smart management to look at your income and expenses and 
how you can reduce your overhead expenses. For example, if a program 
grant is discontinued, you need to know the impact on your organization. 
Without a budget, you won’t know what hit you and how much it’s gonna 
hurt you. And without a budget you won’t have a clue about the steps you 
need to take to deal with the effects of the unanticipated grant closure.
 
Many people feel that having a budget limits their spending ability. But 
contrary to popular belief, a budget means you’re aware of and in control of 
your money.
Large corporations monitor and control their spending. They’re always 
assessing and re-assessing how they manufacture products and how they can 
reduce expenses to keep profits up. Although you’re not in your field for the 
money, your organization can’t be successful without money. Therefore, it’s 
important that you have a financial plan or budget.

123
 Chapter 8: Balancing Cash Flow: Creating an Operating Budget
Getting Off to a Good Start: Preparing 
to Create an Operating Budget
Before you can put together your nonprofit’s operating budget, you have to 
make the necessary preparations. If you were planning a month-long trip to 
Europe, you wouldn’t wake up on the morning of your flight and run to the 
airport with only a carry-on bag and no planning. Weeks in advance you have 
to book your flight and hotels, pack accordingly, and have a general idea of 
where you’re going.
Your budget is your resource allocation instrument. Creating an operating 
budget for your nonprofit follows the same lines. You have to prepare 
by determining guidelines, setting your priorities and goals, and keeping 
everything organized. By creating your operating budget, you’ll know how 
much money you have, how much you plan to receive, how much you need, 
and what you can plan to achieve. You can use your operating budget to plan 
for future purchases. You can also use your budget to determine how much 
you need to secure in contributions to sustain your nonprofit.
Your financial statements indicate what has already happened (check out 
the chapters in Part IV for putting together your nonprofit’s financial 
statements). You prepare these statements after the fiscal year ends. You can 
use your financial statements as a tool to help you predict your budget for 
the upcoming fiscal year. Use your financial statements to figure out why 
things happened and then analyze the figures to come up with your new 
operating budget to offset some of the occurrences that occurred (and may 
occur again). Creating an operating budget gives you another chance to plan 
and control what happens in the upcoming year.
Innovative short-term ways to reduce expenses
As a nonprofit, you’re always looking for ways 
to reduce expenses. If you need to reduce your 
expenses, you may want to consider some 
short-term approaches. For example, you may 
cut overtime and pay increases, freeze hiring, 
stop all travel, and downsize your expense 
accounts. You can also focus on reducing your 
electricity bill by setting the thermostat to 
around 72 degrees during the summer and 68 
degrees during the winter. You may even have 
the thermostat set to come on one hour after 
arriving to work and to shut down automatically 
one hour before closing.

124
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
Start your budget process by forming a team that includes your executive 
director, chief financial officer, and finance committee or budget task group 
(see “Establishing a budget task group” later in the chapter for more on this 
topic). Then make sure to have a copy of your mission statement handy. The 
team assigned to draft your budget will use your mission statement to come 
up with the guidelines, priorities, and goals needed for the budgeting process.
The following sections walk you through the different steps your organization 
needs to take before creating your nonprofit’s budget.
Setting clear guidelines
Start your budgeting process by looking at your organization’s vision 
and purpose, as defined in your mission statement. Your budget guidelines 
are centered on your mission and what it takes to accomplish your 
organization’s goals. They guide your nonprofit in developing a budget 
that shows how your funding priorities support your strategic plan. Most 
strategic plans cover three to five years, defining steps to achieve goals with 
charts that direct the process. Your strategic plan should be in writing so 
you can look at it and see whether you’re on track. (For help in establishing 
your strategic plan, check out Strategic Planning For Dummies by Erica Olsen 
[Wiley].)
Budget guidelines allow you to review and evaluate budget requests and 
submit recommendations to your board of directors. These guidelines help 
you make measurable progress toward your goals. All budget items should 
be tied to performance indicators so you can measure their outcomes.
Your guidelines define how you plan to improve the effectiveness of your 
current system. Some of the items included in budget guidelines are
 
✓ Guidelines for salary increases
 
✓ Budget for operations
 
✓ Line item transfers
 
✓ Guidelines for adjustments
 
✓ Annual fundraising goals and priorities
Remember that these budget guidelines are just that — guidelines — and 
they’re not written in stone! You may have to make adjustments as your 
fiscal year progresses.

125
 Chapter 8: Balancing Cash Flow: Creating an Operating Budget
 
Having clear guidelines helps you recognize the importance of budget 
maintenance for your organization. Your budget allows you to focus on items 
and issues that are relevant to your board’s fiscal priorities.
Identifying your nonprofit’s objectives
As you’re creating your budget and setting and following your guidelines, it’s 
important for you to establish and know the importance of your objectives. 
These objectives are what your organization wants to achieve — in other 
words your organization’s priorities. You need to identify your objectives and 
put them on paper so you can track your progress and see what needs your 
immediate attention.
With so much to do every day and so many distractions, having clear goals 
and objectives for your organization and for each program is important. 
What may be a priority for you may not be for the next person. Knowing your 
priorities makes day-to-day decisions easier. Planning and strategizing aren’t 
just for the for-profit industry. As a nonprofit, you need a plan for your future. 
A five-year plan with set priorities is an excellent road map.
Commonly stated budget priorities include all of the following:
 
✓ Maintain financial stability of the organization
 
✓ Maintain commitment to target population
 
✓ Assess and ensure quality of program delivery
 
✓ Improve and expand capital campaign
To identify your priorities, do the following:
 
1. Write down the activities that are most important and rank them 
in order.
 
 Ask yourself what your organization’s most important activities are.
 
2. Make a list of current and future activities that you plan to achieve.
 
 Ask yourself what the benefits of the activities are. Determine the 
purpose and goals and rank your list according to the greatest benefit 
to the groups that will be helped.
 
 Many organizations assign a score for priorities within each program. 
For example, you can assign a number to each priority on your list 
indicating its importance.

126
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
Eyeing goals
Without a vision, organizations perish. Your nonprofit’s goals are visionary 
statements that motivate you and others to do something. Goals are end 
results that you desire to obtain. Before you can put together your operating 
budget, you need to know what your organization’s goals are.
 
Defining clear goals and having a plan in place to reach them can save you 
from going into financial crisis mode. You’re in financial crisis mode when you 
operate day to day with no definite plan for sustainability. To avoid operating 
in crisis mode, set clear, concise goals for your organization as a whole, as 
well as for each of your programs.
 
To obtain your goals, you have to have objectives that are tied to the goals. 
Activity makes goals happen. But if you do nothing but think about it and take 
no action, nothing is going to happen. For example, I’ve had a personal goal to 
lose 10 pounds for the last three years. It’s not a priority, but it’s something I 
desire. Because it’s not a priority, nothing is happening. Actually, I believe 
I’ve gained 5 more pounds while thinking about losing 10. If I cut back on my 
eating and implement an exercise routine, the weight would fall off.
Ideally your goal statement starts broadly by first identifying the overall 
goals for the organization and then indicating on a program-by-program basis 
what the major actions should be for the upcoming budget year. Start with 
goals for the entire organization and then look at goals for each program.
The organization’s goals
Your nonprofit’s goals are the big picture of success for your organization. 
They may include growth in personnel, effectiveness in the sphere of 
influence, the ability to partner with other organizations, and so on.
 
You, as the director of your nonprofit, and your board need to set your 
organization’s goals. To do so, take the following steps:
 
1. Decide what you want the end results to be.
 
2. Set a measurable way to indicate performance.
 
3. Assign a number by which you can gauge whether you’ve met 
your goals.
 
 This number serves sort of like a checkpoint. You need to decide and set 
realistic measurable performance numbers, such as 10 percent more 
people will be served in the upcoming year.

127
 Chapter 8: Balancing Cash Flow: Creating an Operating Budget
After you set your organization’s goals, you then have to prioritize them. 
Some people assign numbers to their goals based on priority. To prioritize, 
you need to rank in order the steps needed to accomplish your goals. 
Whatever the first step is to reaching your goal can be assigned number one. 
Your top priority is the first step toward reaching your goals. Just work your 
list by moving on to step two and so on.
 
Setting goals alone doesn’t yield results. You have to do something to bring 
your goals to reality.
You can’t accomplish your organization’s goals without a clear funding 
plan. Your funding plan defines how much money you need to raise from 
all sources to operate. You need the following to organize a funding plan:
 
✓ Mission statement defining your purpose or vision
 
✓ Funding goals
 
✓ Funding objectives
 
✓ List of potential funders
 
✓ Action plan
 
To create a funding plan, simply write down the five preceding items on a 
sheet of paper or on your computer. Your funding plan contains information 
about where you plan to get the money (list of potential funders) to fund 
your programs. I suggest you do your budget first, so you can identify what 
your goals, objectives, and needs are and then do your funding plan.
Individual program goals
You also need individual program goals to keep you and your staff motivated. 
These program goals are performance levels of what you see as the end result 
of a particular program. The only difference between organizational goals 
and programs goals is organizational goals include program goals, whereas 
program goals are only for one particular program. For example, if your 
program is a mentoring project, then your goal may be that 5 percent more 
children will be mentored this year than last year.
Program goals require much of the same thought process as setting organiza-
tion goals. You need to have clearly defined goals, a well-written plan in place 
to keep programs up and running, and innovative ideas to attract funders. 
You can then use these goals to help you establish a program budget.
 
Creating a separate budget for each program shows good fiscal management. 
Separate program budgets allow you to see what programs are sustaining 
themselves and which ones are experiencing cash shortages. Tailored budgets 
also help when a program needs to be cut or budget items have to be reduced. 
You create a budget for a program the same way you create a budget for your 

128
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
organization, except you may have different categories. (Check out the 
“Coming Up with an Operating Budget” section later in this chapter for how to 
develop your program budgets.)
 
After you set a goal, begin working toward achieving it right away. Every 
activity you do should lead to accomplishing your goal. A good way to 
reach your goals is to break them down into smaller steps. So if you have a 
fundraising goal for the year of $15,000, you may want to see how much you’ve 
raised after each quarter. When you get to each quarter, you can check to 
see whether you’ve achieved one-quarter, half, and three-quarters of what 
you plan to achieve. If you haven’t, then you can make adjustments to the 
budget or look for ways to increase funding.
As you reach your goals, cross them off the list. If you reached your goal of 
raising $15,000 at the midway point, you can cross that goal off the list, 
because you’ve achieved it.
And your program goals don’t have to stay the same year after year. 
As your organization changes, you have to re-evaluate your goals and 
priorities.
Staying organized
In order to achieve your goals for your organization and programs, you can’t 
let important details slip through the cracks. Staying organized is key to 
meeting your goals (and staying on budget). Planning and getting organized 
not only helps with your goals and budget, but also with your stress levels. 
Being organized allows you to find things, so it saves you money. Remember 
the old saying, “Time equals money, and money equals time.” So if you 
spend less time looking for things, you’ll be more productive and focused on 
operating your organization.
Staying organized requires paying attention to details, timeframes, and 
deadlines. It’s a process that takes time, energy, and motivation. To stay 
organized, I suggest these tips.
Use a detailed calendar with timeframes and deadlines
For staying organized, calendars on which you note timeframes and dead-
lines are essential. You handle many tasks within your organization that have 
beginnings and endings. Knowing these dates allows you to schedule time to 
work on them so you don’t miss important deadlines.

129
 Chapter 8: Balancing Cash Flow: Creating an Operating Budget
Your budget and work plan should be scheduled so everyone involved is on 
the same page. Developing a budget calendar with a timeline can help your 
board, finance committee, budget task group, and treasurer stay on track. 
You can use helpful tools such as planners, phone and address books, PDAs, 
and client databases to keep calendars updated.
You want to schedule the timeline for creating next year’s budget based on 
your fiscal year. Most people allow at least three months from preliminary to 
approval. So if your fiscal year starts in May, you’d start working on the new 
budget no later than February 1. Some larger tasks can be broken down into 
smaller tasks, and the due dates for those incremental steps should be noted 
and shared with everyone.
File all paperwork in a timely manner
You evaluate your budget and monitor your progress throughout the year. 
Therefore, you need to create a set of files to keep up with the changes so 
you can easily access the information. Organizing your papers helps organize 
your thoughts. You can purchase a file cabinet, a file box, and some hanging 
file folders and manila folders to sort the papers. You can label files by 
month. Filing the paperwork month by month saves time and reduces your 
stress levels. Make sure you keep up with receipts for major purchases and 
supplies, as well as documents related to payroll taxes.
Throw away what you don’t need
As your board meets to discuss changes needed to the budget and new 
programs that need to be implemented, you may find yourself swimming in 
paperwork. It may not be a good idea to hold on to the paperwork from the 
first budget meeting 15 years ago. At some point, you need to clear out the 
old and make room for the new. Throw away anything more than 5 years old. 
De-clutter your storage files and cabinets. Consider dumping or donating 
items you don’t need. Manage your mail. Pick up a magazine rack and throw 
away magazines older than a month.
Outline your tasks
When you outline tasks, you create a systematic way to know when to start 
and complete something. You can make a to-do list and prioritize which 
tasks need to be done and when. For example, I create a to-do list every day 
to organize my work and time. Even if I don’t finish everything on my list, 
at least my priorities are already organized for the next day. When you 
complete a task, you can cross it off your list and then manage the remaining 
tasks to know which ones you can realistically expect to complete.

130
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
As you set your goals, you establish an outline of tasks to ensure that you 
reach the goal. As you accomplish a goal, cross it off the list and start on 
another one.
To complete your tasks, you use a bit of time and money. If you know how 
much of each is needed, assign that portion so you can get an overall idea 
about what is needed financially to accomplish each task and ultimately 
reach your goals.
Your spending plan is your budget. To outline your spending plans for the 
coming year, you want to review the following tasks:
 
✓ Developing new programs
 
✓ Expanding existing programs
 
✓ Creating fundraising recommendations
 
✓ Securing funding for new projects through grants
 
✓ Developing a dedicated Web site for donations
 
✓ Locating in-kind funding to match grants
 
Some people like to group tasks into phases. Phase one is usually the planning 
phase. Phase two may be securing funding for a project. Phase three is 
implementation of a project.
Coming Up with an Operating Budget
After you make the necessary preparations by establishing guidelines, 
identifying your priorities, and setting goals, you’re ready to put everything 
down on paper in the form of a budget. You want to look at what your 
expenses are and how much money it takes to cover them. Also, consider 
new programs that are needed and think about how you might fund them. 
With these points in mind, you’re ready to create your organization’s 
operating budget (see Figure 8-1).
The following sections take you on the budgeting journey by explaining the 
simple steps of how to put together an operating budget, including the ins 
and outs of what to include.
 
You may wonder how your budget differs from the financial statements 
you’re required to prepare. Your budget shows what you expect to happen 
financially; it’s based on predictions. Your statement of activities shows 
how much you collected and how much you spent; it’s based on the reality of 
what happened.

Walking through the steps 
to the budget: The how-to
Creating a budget isn’t complicated. Start with a blank piece of paper in hand 
and follow the steps in this section.
Step 1: Prioritize and determine the need
Look at last year’s budget and compare it to every new item to be added to 
this year’s budget and ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Is there a need for this activity?
 
✓ How important is it that we do it?
 
✓ Are there ways we can reduce the cost of running a program?
 
✓ How much does it really cost us?

132
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
This process is time consuming and one of the reasons many organizations 
don’t create a budget. However, by not taking this step, you miss things that 
need attention, like how you fund your activities and if there’s a less costly 
way to provide more services for the same or less amount of money. You 
then refer to the results of these questions as you start talking numbers.
Step 2: Make a list of everything coming in and going out
Take a blank sheet of paper and write down your actual revenue amounts 
and their sources — the grants and donations you already have — followed 
by your actual expenses and their amounts. Refer to Figure 8-1 for an 
example.
You have two types of expenses to consider:
 
✓ Variable expenses: These are amounts you pay that change from month 
to month. An example is the cost of utilities.
 
✓ Fixed expenses: The cost of these expenses is the same from month to 
month. A rent payment is generally considered a fixed expense.
 
 To make more expenses fixed, such as utilities, see if the provider offers 
a budget plan. The budget plan takes an average of a year’s worth of 
utility costs and charges you the average amount each month. It stops 
fluctuations in bills. Going on a budget plan can help you stay in balance 
with your expense projections.
If you’re not sure exactly how much to budget for, take a look at last year’s 
budget and receipts from last month, last quarter, and last year. Use 
these documents to make realistic predictions about what will happen 
next month, next quarter, and next year.
Step 3: Separate actual income vs. projected income
Your budget is an estimate of your expected cash flow. Based on prior 
periods, you can gauge what will happen in the future. When creating a 
budget, you focus on these two items:
 
✓ Actual amounts: Your actual amount is what you have already received 
or a fixed amount. (Fixed amounts are those things that are preset and 
not subject to change, such as money you already have on reserve, and 
existing grants and contracts.)
 
✓ Projected amounts: Your projected amount is what you expect to 
receive, such as a large donation. Your projected income includes your 
actual income plus your expected income.

133
 Chapter 8: Balancing Cash Flow: Creating an Operating Budget
One of three things is going to happen: You’ll get what you expect (project), 
or you’ll get more or less. Yet, forecasting your expectations is crucial to 
your organization’s budgetary process.
So when separating actual and projected income, do the following:
 
1. Take realistic projections.
 
 Begin with amounts you feel somewhat sure about, like grants and 
contracts you’ve received in the last year. Make sure these amounts 
are realistic projections, not merely a wish list, because what you plan 
to purchase and how you plan to pay your employees are contingent 
on you being realistic.
 
2. After the time period expires, list what actually happened.
 
 You can do so at the end of the month, quarter, or year. Just make sure 
you compare what you projected with what you received. Then keep a 
close eye on your budget as time passes, so you can be prepared to 
make adjustments as needed. You want to know how well you’ve 
planned things to help you plan better the next time.
 
3. Evaluate the difference between what you projected and what actually 
took place.
 
 All you do here is subtract what happened from what you expected to 
happen and look at the results. Sometimes you may get more than 
you expect, which is good. Other times you may have less. So plan an 
alternative way to raise the money, which may be another fundraiser or 
loan. It’s a decision that you and your board need to discuss.
Step 4: Compare income to expenses 
and make adjustments as necessary
After you know what your expenses are likely to be and how much money 
you expect to bring in, you can figure out your projected bottom line for the 
period. In other words, you can subtract your projected expenses from your 
projected revenues and see whether you’ll have a net increase or decrease in 
assets (refer to Figure 8-1).
If your budget shows a positive number, you’ve got a net increase in assets, 
meaning you’ve got some money left over. You can increase your spending in 
one of the expense categories, or you can plan to save the additional revenue 
in case something unexpected happens — the economy takes a nosedive, 
you have to replace the heating and cooling system, you lose grant funding, 
or some other unfortunate event takes place.

134
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
If your budget shows a negative number, you’ve got a net decrease in assets, 
meaning your expenses are larger than your revenues. You can handle this a 
couple of ways:
 
✓ You can take a look at your expenses and see where you can cut 
some costs.
 
✓ You can look at your revenues and see if there’s a way you can increase 
the amount of funding you’re bringing in.
Getting your budget approved
Your organization’s finance committee should have a budget timeline for 
preparing, reviewing, and getting board approval of your budget in an 
organized and timely fashion. Most nonprofits have a calendar with a time-
line of budget meetings that covers a two- to eight-week period. As things 
happen or change, you can make adjustments to your budget. Your annual 
budget may require your board’s approval, but you can evaluate your budget 
as new grant programs are funded, as old grant programs expire, and any 
other time something happens in your organization that directly affects your 
revenues and expenses.
If you’re the executive director, you and the finance committee discuss and 
assess the organization’s priorities and present the budget to your board 
of directors. Your board of directors reviews and evaluates your operating 
budget to assess how it aligns with your budget priorities, mission, and 
strategic plan. Your board of directors adopts your annual budget through 
recommendations and an approval process.
Now, your board and executive staff can compare the expected amounts to 
the actual results. Seldom do things go as planned, but nevertheless you 
must plan. Your board and management staff carefully evaluate the gap 
between actual and budget performance and use it as a tool for future 
endeavors.
Reviewing Budget Performance
As you proceed through the year, you simply can’t set your budget aside and 
hope that all of your projections were accurate. You have to regularly review 
the budget to ensure you’re on pace. Many organizations review the budget 
monthly. Usually at quarterly points or mid-year, organizations recast and 
revise their budgets if their estimates were off significantly.

135
 Chapter 8: Balancing Cash Flow: Creating an Operating Budget
Furthermore, after your accounting period ends, you need to evaluate the 
budget and look for ways to become more cost efficient before you start the 
new budget for the next year. The following sections address some ways you 
can review your budget and make the necessary revisions for future budgets.
Establishing a budget task group
Your finance committee keeps an eye on the progress of your budget and 
evaluates it at year-end. Your board may also want to set up a budget task 
group to help evaluate your organization’s budget. A budget task group’s 
primary role is to recommend innovative ideas for savings and income 
generation and to achieve a balanced budget by examining and questioning 
the need for every line item in your budget.
Some budget items place pressure on the budget. Things like salaries, 
pensions, reductions in grants, and increasing expenses place a strain on 
your overall organization. Your budget task group must examine ways to 
ease the pressure, and it may need to do some serious brainstorming to 
address the shortfall. The group members may suggest ways to generate 
income or stimulate giving. They may come up with creative ideas to stir 
something inside of your donors to increase their desire to invest in your 
organization. Or they may come up with innovative ways to streamline 
operations to cut costs the following year.
Making adjustments
Good things as well as bad things will happen to your organization. 
Equipment will break down, and employees will quit; but you’ll also have 
unexpected revenues from donors. When good things happen, it makes 
things better. But when bad things happen, you need to be prepared.
After careful analysis of what has happened, you may be able to predict 
what will happen in the future. You can use the “Difference” column on your 
budget worksheet (see Figure 8-1) to help you determine what your next step 
should be.
For example, if your actual revenues were $250,000 rather than $225,000, 
you would be in a better financial position than you expected. But if you only 
collect $200,000, and you expected to bring in $213,000, what do you do? 
Now you have $13,000 less than you planned. (In this case because expenses 
are relatively low, you’ll probably be okay. But if coming up short in revenue 
becomes a trend, eventually it will present cash flow problems.)

136
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
With the budget in front of them, your board members may make adjust-
ments by revising tasks and schedules. Some programs may be canceled 
and budget line items reallocated. You may also consider scaling back 
on purchases or increasing the costs of services. Other places to look for 
additional funds are in your reserves and donor restricted gifts. If possible, 
you should ease the reserve policy.
 
If you have a budget deficit (a shortage of funds or when expenses outweigh 
revenues), devise a plan to manage down the deficit. Get rid of your deficit as 
fast as you can to avoid potential collapse of your entire outfit.
If you’ve received an unexpected windfall, some new programs may be 
implemented based on your organization’s goals and the needs of your target 
population. Flexibility is needed to keep your organization operational.
 
When you’ve had a particularly good year financially, consider establishing a 
rainy day fund. This is something that is very important to have. Place some of 
the money in a savings account or marketable certificate of deposit (CD) that’s 
easily accessible so you can withdraw the cash quickly in an emergency.

K
nowing the rules of engagement for your nonprofit is similar to follow-
ing the laws to drive your car. If you understand and obey traffic laws, 
register your vehicle, and renew your license, you get to keep your driving 
privileges. The same is true for operating your nonprofit. As long as you 
perform according to federal and state laws, you get to keep your nonprofit 
status. You need to know exactly what the IRS expects of you and what your 
state officials require of you. The core standards of operations come from the 
IRS. Then you have to comply with the state laws regarding your nonprofit’s 
operation.
Federal and state laws are full of references to accounting rules set by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The FASB develops account-
ing standards, principles, and statements about how to prepare, present, and 
report financial information. Accounting standards aren’t laws, but the IRS 
and state government tell you to follow them.
If you don’t keep up with accounting standards and rules, complying with 
federal and state laws can cause you some grief. However, if you have a firm 
grasp of federal and state laws and the accounting standards, you can sort 
through the red tape and know what you need to do; then you’re well on 
your way to staying in compliance. This chapter helps you determine how to 
comply with federal and state laws and accounting rules to keep your non-
profit in good standing.

Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
Understanding Why Being Compliant 
Is Important for Your Nonprofit
The IRS has the authority to give and take away your nonprofit status. So, the 
bottom line is you want to keep the IRS happy and stay in compliance with 
the appropriate federal and state laws and accounting rules. You need to stay 
in compliance for two main reasons:
 
✓ To keep your nonprofit status active. Failure to comply with federal 
laws can cause you to lose your federal tax-free status. Because you’re 
managing other people’s money and you’ve been given a lifetime tax 
waiver from the IRS, you should follow the rules to keep your status 
active.
 
✓ To keep your reputation of being a good steward. Following the do’s 
and don’ts keeps everything in good standing.
As long as you continue to provide the services you promised, stay within 
the purpose of organizing your nonprofit, and submit paperwork to the gov-
ernment in a timely fashion, you’ll be okay. This chapter delves into these 
rules and explains in further detail what you should and shouldn’t do. In 
addition to federal rules, you need to comply with your state laws. These 
laws vary from state to state. Check out the “Register with the proper state 
authority” section later in this chapter for what your state requires of you.
Staying in Compliance: The How-To
Knowing the state and federal laws governing your nonprofit isn’t enough to 
stay in compliance. You and your staff have to take the necessary steps to 
make sure nothing slips between the cracks. Although keeping track and stay-
ing within those specifications can be stressful at times, your organization’s 
nonprofit status depends on it. It may not be a fun job, but someone has to do 
it! The following sections address the four main components your nonprofit 
must adhere to in order to stay in good standing. I give you specific hands-on 
advice you can follow so your agency doesn’t lose its nonprofit status.
Register with the proper state authority
The first step to ensure your nonprofit stays compliant is to register it 
with the appropriate state authority. Each state has its own guidelines 
about how you should account for nonprofit organizations. Some states 

139
 Chapter 9: Staying in Nonprofit Compliance
require nonprofits to register with the secretary of state’s office, state 
department of revenue, and/or state attorney general’s office. Some states 
offer benefits similar to the IRS by granting a sales tax exemption. To find 
your state laws, visit the following Web site: www.irs.gov/charities/
article/0,,id=129028,00.html. Or call your state attorney general’s 
office to get more information about your state’s requirements.
Account for nonprofit activities
For your nonprofit to be compliant, you also need to present your nonprofit’s 
financial activities in accordance with the regulations established by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The FASB is the authoritative 
body for financial oversight for all organizations and businesses in the United 
States.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted authority to 
the FASB to establish rules called generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP). GAAP offer guidance and a list of rules about how to account for 
nonprofit activities. Federal and state laws, as well as the Internal Revenue 
Code, tell you to follow GAAP. Because presenting this how-to informa-
tion is quite involved, I cover it in more detail in the “Following Accounting 
Standards” section later in this chapter.
Hire professional help
Once a year, you need an audit of your financial statements to stay compli-
ant. As a result, you need to hire a certified public accountant (CPA) to per-
form this audit. The CPA evaluates your financial records to verify whether 
they comply with GAAP and properly reflect your activities. Based on the 
CPA’s opinion, you either get a good report of being a worthy steward or a 
not-so-good report. (See Chapter 20 for more information about the auditing 
process.) Your CPA is qualified to offer an opinion as to whether your finan-
cial statements fairly represent your financial position.
 
You can hire a bookkeeper, accountant, or internal auditor for day-to-day 
bookkeeping and accounting, but only an external CPA or CPA firm can per-
form an independent audit of your financial statements. You can keep a CPA 
on retainer so you stay abreast of new rules governing your nonprofit. See the 
later “Selecting an audit committee to hire an independent CPA” section for 
more about choosing an auditor.

140
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
When hiring your nonprofit’s CPA, you should try to adhere to the Sarbanes-
Oxley (SOX) Act. Check out the “Sorting out the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)” 
section later in this chapter for the two specific points that SOX now regulates 
when hiring a CPA. Check out Chapter 2 for more specific information you can 
follow when hiring professional help.
Abide by IRS statutes
The last important process you need to do to ensure your nonprofit stays in 
compliance is to adhere to IRS statutes. To do so, you need to file an annual 
report to the IRS about your nonprofit’s activities. Individuals and for-profit 
corporations pay income taxes by filing an annual income tax return, but 
nonprofits file an information tax-free form. Nonprofits file IRS Form 990, 
Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax, which is informational 
only. (Chapter 14 has step-by-step instructions for filing Form 990.)
 
The IRS requires financial information about all organizations given tax-
exempt status to make sure they’re complying with the agreement. Because 
your nonprofit isn’t paying federal taxes, you’re granted more lenience with 
filing your informational return to the IRS. However, if you file your annual 
return late, you may have to pay a penalty. And, if you forget to file your 
annual return for three years in a row, you can lose your nonprofit status. To 
reinstate your tax-exempt status with the IRS, you’ll have to file the necessary 
paperwork and pay a fee. So make sure you don’t make that mistake.
Following Accounting Standards
To keep your nonprofit operating according to federal and state laws, you 
need to follow some accounting standards. The federal and state laws that 
govern nonprofits include references to generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Did someone spill a can of alphabet soup?
So what do all these letters mean? GAAP covers the specific rules of conduct, 
while the FASB is the actual authoritative body of accounting standards 
(some of the standards are called principles, and some are called statements). 
If these regulations weren’t enough, the SEC decided that new rules were 
needed to clarify the old ones, so the agency adopted SOX to keep manage-
ment and accountants on track. The following sections take a closer look at 
these three sets of regulations and what you need to do to ensure your non-
profit is in compliance.

141
 Chapter 9: Staying in Nonprofit Compliance
The fascinating FASB
The FASB governs and provides financial accounting and reporting oversight 
for your nonprofit. You don’t deal directly with these folks, but you need to 
stay abreast of rules that they create. In most cases, your state or the IRS is 
your first point of contact, but the rules have a trickledown effect. This section 
focuses on the two statements you need to know about to stay in compliance.
FASB Statement No. 116: Accounting for 
Contributions Received and Made
Statement No. 116 dictates how you should recognize donated assets, contri-
butions made, contributions received, the classification of contributed assets 
and services, and the disclosure of all of these. If you make or receive contri-
butions, Statement No. 116 applies to you.
You should keep in mind four things when handling contributions according 
to Statement No. 116:
 
✓ Contributions received are recognized as revenues in the period they’re 
received and recorded at their fair market value. Contributions received 
are the donations people make to your nonprofit. Fair market value is 
the price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to sell for.
 
✓ Contributions made are recognized as expenses in the period made 
at their fair market value. Contributions made are donations your non-
profit gives in support of someone else.
 
✓ Unconditional promises to give should be recognized as revenues in 
the period received at their fair market values. Unconditional promises 
are donations received that have no restrictions about how or when 
they can be used, and they’re treated like contributions made.
 
✓ Conditional promises to give, whether received or made, should be 
recognized when they become unconditional. A conditional promise is 
a donation given based on a specific condition or the passage of time. 
When a conditional promise becomes unconditional, you should rec-
ognize it as revenue in the period it becomes unconditional at its fair 
market value. Assets received with a conditional promise to contribute 
them when certain conditions are met are recorded as a refundable 
advance (liability) until the conditions are met and the gift becomes 
unconditional.
 
 In addition, FASB Statement No. 116 requires conditional promises to be 
classified based on whether donations received increased one of the fol-
lowing net asset classifications:

142
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
• Permanently restricted net assets
 
• Temporarily restricted net assets
 
• Unrestricted net assets
 
 For definitions of these three types of net assets, check out Chapter 16.
You need to classify your contributions because you’ll use this information 
to complete your financial statements. When you report your income and 
expenses on your statement of activities, you separately report the activity 
for each net asset class. Sometimes the class activities are shown in columns, 
other times in separate sections; it’s your choice. The ending net asset bal-
ance for each classification on the statement of activities (think income 
statement) is transferred to the net asset section of the statement of financial 
position (think equity section of the balance sheet).
One final thing you need to keep in mind concerns volunteer time and ser-
vices. I know you rely on volunteers to keep your nonprofit ticking, and many 
of the things your volunteers do aren’t recorded on your books. According to 
FASB Statement No. 116, some volunteer time may need to be accounted for 
as contribution revenue from donated services.
I know these hours are a headache to keep track of. And I know you give your 
volunteers their props at social events, in your newsletter, and on your Web 
site. But you may be required to determine how much the services are worth 
(fair market value) and account for them on your financial statements as con-
tributions made. You only have to account for volunteer services if
 
✓ The services create or enhance nonfinancial assets. This speaks to situ-
ations where an asset owned by your nonprofit is created or improved 
by volunteer efforts. A classic example of this is the construction or ren-
ovation of a facility with a volunteer workforce of skilled and unskilled 
labor. To calculate the value of such services, deduct the differences 
between the appraised market value of the finished asset and the out-of-
pocket costs paid to do the project.
 
✓ The services require specialized skills, are provided by individuals 
possessing those skills, and would typically need to be purchased if 
not provided by donation. For example, an attorney who volunteers 
professional counsel for your organization is something you should 
account for as a contribution made. Determine the fair market value of 
the services and account for it.
 
Don’t dread having to account for volunteers, because having these numbers 
comes in handy when preparing grant proposals. You can take the value of 
your volunteers’ time and use it as a possible match in funds. For instance, if 
your potential funders ask you for a match in services, you may be able to use 
your volunteers’ contributions as the match.

143
 Chapter 9: Staying in Nonprofit Compliance
FASB Statement No. 117: Financial Statements 
of Not-for-Profit Organizations
FASB Statement No. 117 covers financial statements of nonprofits. It specifies 
information to be reported in financial statements and how to report assets, 
liabilities, net assets, revenues, expenses, gains, and losses.
According to FASB Statement No. 117, all nonprofit organizations should pro-
vide a complete set of financial statements, defined as the following (see the 
chapters in Part IV for more info):
 
✓ Statement of financial position: This statement sums up your organiza-
tion’s overall financial picture.
 
✓ Statement of activities: This document shows how your nonprofit’s net 
assets have increased or decreased.
 
✓ Cash flow statement: This form shows how your nonprofit’s cash posi-
tion has changed.
 
✓ Statement of functional expense: This statement is required for vol-
untary health and welfare organizations, such as the American Cancer 
Society. This statement shows by line item and category how much 
you’ve spent for program costs, management and general expenses, and 
fundraising expenses. There are pending issues surrounding this docu-
ment and talk about making it a required statement for all nonprofits.
 
 Your statement of functional expense can be its own financial statement 
(see Chapter 18), or you can include the information on your statement 
of activities or in the notes to the financial statements.
This statement requires a breakdown of your revenues (donations, program 
service fees, and so on), expenses, gains, and losses. In addition to clearly 
separating these items, you’re required to classify them within classes of net 
assets — permanently restricted, temporarily restricted, or unrestricted on 
the statement of activities. (See Chapter 16 for more info.)
The world according to GAAP
GAAP lay the ground rules for accounting. All accountants use GAAP when 
accounting for, preparing, and presenting financial information. The prin-
ciples allow you to fairly evaluate and compare numbers. Think of GAAP as 
a uniform way to examine and record financial activities. These guidelines 
create a level playing field, so all nonprofits play by the same rules. The way 
you present your financial position is the same way a nonprofit in another 
state evaluates its position, according to GAAP.

144
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
All GAAP-based financial statements are presented using the accrual basis of 
accounting, which deals with the recognition of transactions. For example, 
all transactions are recorded on the books when they occur, no matter when 
cash actually exchanges hands. (See Chapter 2 for more information about the 
accrual basis of accounting.)
To ensure that you stay in compliance and protect your nonprofit’s status, 
make sure you adhere to the following GAAP principles:
 
✓ Cost principle: This principle requires assets to be recorded in the 
books at their cost. This is the price paid in exchange for the asset. This 
cost is commonly referred to as the historical cost because it doesn’t 
change. It doesn’t matter if the asset’s current value goes up (appreci-
ates) or goes down (depreciates); the value recorded on the statement of 
financial position remains the same, according to the cost principle.
 
✓ Business entity concern: This notion deals with the separate legal entity 
concept, which means that if you incorporate, your nonprofit is a sepa-
rate legal entity from you and/or the owners. The biggest advantage 
to incorporating is to protect your board and staff from personal legal 
liabilities, such as lawsuits. If the nonprofit is separate from you, then it, 
not you, is responsible for its debts and any charges of misconduct.
 
 Of course, being a separate business entity doesn’t mean that you 
can’t be sued. Anyone can file a lawsuit, so the ultimate protection is to 
acquire board of directors, management, and officers insurance.
 
✓ Objective principle: This principle states that you determine and verify 
the value of all donated items as objectively as possible. All donated 
items go on your financial statements as assets. To fairly represent your 
true financial condition, you have to give them an objective value.
 
 When valuing assets donated to your organization, you should seek an 
objective opinion or outside help to evaluate the value. Asking a quali-
fied independent third-party who has no interest in the outcome gives 
an objective view. To determine a donated asset’s value, check the fol-
lowing sources:
 
• Sticker price or purchase invoice
 
• Sales invoice
 
• Property deeds
 
• Transfer of title
 
• Kelly Blue Book value
 
• Banker or creditor
 
 Don’t value the donated assets you receive by simply asking the donor 
and reporting the amount he says. You still need to verify the item’s 
worth by asking an independent third-party who has no financial inter-
est in the outcome to give you a value.

145
 Chapter 9: Staying in Nonprofit Compliance
 
✓ Matching principle: This principle requires donations and revenues 
received and expenses incurred to be recorded in the same period you 
receive or incur them. In other words, you should recognize expenses in 
the period you incur the expense. For example, if you pay your employ-
ees in January for work done in December, when you complete your 
financial statements, you should record the liability in December.
 
 You should match contributions received with expenses incurred in the 
same time period on the statement of activities. If someone makes a $50 
donation to pay a volunteer, you should match that donation with the 
volunteer expense in the same time period, unless there are restrictions. 
(When I say time period, I’m talking about the accounting period, which 
is one year.)
 
✓ Revenue-recognition principle: When you receive donations, you must 
recognize them as revenue when they become unconditional. For more 
information about restricted and conditional contributions, see Chapter 16.
 
 Conditional contributions and restricted contributions are often con-
fused because restrictions can be conditions. But not all conditions are 
restrictions. A donor offers you a potential gift of say $10,000, but he 
won’t give it to you unless your organization can raise X dollars or meet 
some criteria. If you meet the condition, you get the money with no 
strings attached; it’s recognized as an unrestricted contribution. However, 
the donor may say you can have $10,000 for your capital campaign to 
be spent on bricks and mortar if you raise X dollars. Then if you raise 
the money, the gift becomes unconditional, but it’s restricted, and so 
recorded as a restricted contribution. When spent on bricks and mortar, 
the restriction is met, and it becomes unrestricted.
 
✓ Expense-recognition principle: This principle deals with the timing of 
when expenses are recognized. Expenses are reported as decreases to 
unrestricted net assets on the statement of activities. A classic example 
of recognizing expenses occurs at the end of the year when employees 
have worked, but won’t get paid until January. You need to account for 
this expense in the period you incur the expense. A lot of places pay 
you only after you’ve worked, and you may have a couple of weeks in 
the hole. When the paychecks are cut in January, they are for work com-
pleted in December. You should account for this on your statement of 
financial position and statement of activities ending December 31.
 
✓ Full-disclosure principle: This principle states that changes made to account-
ing methods, inventory valuation, and pending lawsuits must be disclosed 
in the notes to the financial statements. (Check out Chapter 19 for more 
information.) Anything that may have a big impact on your financial con-
dition should be noted or disclosed in the financial statements.
 
✓ Consistency principle: You need to be consistent in your methods when 
accounting for revenues and expenses to fairly represent your financial 
statements. Accounting information is useful when you can compare 

146
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
it to prior years or to organizations of similar size. In making these 
comparisons, changes in accounting methods affect the numbers on 
your financial statements.
 
 Using one accounting method for three months and then switching to 
a different method before the close of the accounting period probably 
isn’t a good idea. You want to be consistent, and making the change can 
change your bottom line and could misrepresent your true financial 
position. Of course, any changes in accounting methods should be noted 
in the notes to the financial statements. Furthermore, flip-flopping your 
depreciation method can also adversely affect your net assets on your 
financial statements. The way you value your inventory and depreciate 
your assets affects your income or net assets. (To depreciate an asset 
means to write off the cost of an asset by charging it as an expense.)
 
 For example, say you’ve been using the straight-line method to depreci-
ate your assets, and you decide to switch to the double-declining bal-
ance depreciation method. The straight-line method writes off the cost 
of assets equally over the useful life of the asset. The double-declining 
balance method accelerates depreciation by writing off more of the cost 
of an asset in the early years. Because depreciation is an expense that’s 
subtracted from revenue, if more expense is deducted, the result is less 
income. So changing methods can give you a more favorable outcome or 
a less favorable one. Check out Chapter 2 for a complete discussion of 
different depreciation methods and which one is best for your nonprofit.
 
 The best time to switch accounting methods is when FASB deems it nec-
essary. Of course, you must handle your records the best way to reflect 
your true financial position. It’s probably best to wait until your current 
period ends before switching to a different method.
 
Although these principles don’t have anything to do with actual math, you still 
need to follow them to keep your nonprofit out of financial trouble. In your 
nonprofit’s accounting, you have to apply these GAAP rules consistently to 
evaluate the treatment of accounts. After accountants complete this evalua-
tion, they then add, subtract, multiply, and/or divide.
Sorting out the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
In response to public outcry after Enron and other public accounting scan-
dals, Maryland Sen. Paul Sarbanes and Ohio Rep. Michael Oxley worked 
together on protective measures to stop the fraudulent practices of account-
ing firms and their clients across the nation. These protective measures 
resulted in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, commonly referred to as SOX. The SOX 
Act is very complex, and it only applies to publicly traded companies — 
those registered with the SEC. However, many nonprofits have adopted pro-
visions of SOX that help improve the management and financial reporting of 
their organization. You only need to concern yourself with the two important 
points I explain in the following sections.

147
 Chapter 9: Staying in Nonprofit Compliance
Selecting an audit committee to hire an independent CPA
One of the many Sarbanes-Oxley Act initiatives deals with audit committees 
and auditors’ independence. An audit committee is responsible for board finan-
cial and accounting oversight. The committee, which consists of at least three 
independent members of your board, with at least one being a financial expert, 
selects your auditing firm and ensures that the firm is independent. Individual 
board members aren’t part of the organization’s management team or paid man-
agement consultants; their only compensation is for being a board member. (See 
Chapter 20 for more information about forming an audit committee.)
The general standards on auditor independence outline what your audit com-
mittee should consider when choosing whether to enter into a relationship 
with or service provided by an auditor. To make sure an auditor’s services 
are done independently, the auditor isn’t allowed to perform certain non-
auditing services and is prohibited from forming certain relationships. Your 
auditing committee should request a signed statement from the selected 
auditor verifying that none of the services in the upcoming list are being 
provided. These rules were created to make sure your auditor independently 
presents your financial statements according to GAAP.
The auditor is prohibited from providing the following non-audit services to 
an audit client, including its affiliates:
 
✓ Bookkeeping
 
✓ Designing and implementing financial information systems
 
✓ Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-
kind reports
 
✓ Actuarial services
 
✓ Internal audit outsourcing services
 
✓ Management functions of human resources
 
✓ Broker-dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services
 
✓ Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit
 
The purpose for all of these guidelines is to make sure your financial state-
ments fairly represent your financial position. To avoid a biased opinion, it’s 
important that your auditor is totally independent and has no other deals with 
you that may possibly sway his professional opinion of your organization.
Prohibited relationships are also an important point to remember under SOX. 
They’re relationships between you and/or your nonprofit and the firm, CPA, 
or auditor who will offer an opinion about your financial statements. The fol-
lowing are rules about prohibited relationships:

148
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
✓ Employment relationships: A one-year cooling-off period is required 
before you can hire certain individuals who were formerly employed by 
your auditor in a financial reporting oversight role. The audit committee 
should consider whether hiring someone who is or was employed by the 
audit firm will affect the audit firm’s independence.
 
✓ Contingent fees: Audit committees shouldn’t approve engagements that 
pay an independent auditor based on the outcome of the audit results. 
In other words, your auditor must give a professional opinion based on 
your records and reports, not on how much or how you pay him. Such 
compensation may color the auditor’s independence.
 
✓ Direct or material indirect business relationships: Auditors and their 
firms can’t form direct or material indirect relationships with the non-
profit, its officers, directors, or major donors. Direct business relation-
ships refer to relationships where something tangible or of value (such 
as an investment) is involved between you and the auditor. For example, 
a relationship where the auditor has an investment in your organiza-
tion would not be good. Material indirect business relationships are 
ones where you may have some other business dealings with a family 
member or affiliate of the CPA firm or auditor, whereby ownership is 
more than 5 percent.
 
✓ Certain financial relationships: Your audit committee should be aware 
that certain financial relationships between your nonprofit and the 
independent auditor are prohibited. These include creditor/debtor rela-
tionships, banking, broker-dealer, insurance products, and interests in 
investment companies.
To avoid any potential problems, set up an audit committee, be cautious 
when using an auditing firm to provide non-auditing services except for tax 
preparation, and disclose all accounting policies and practices to your audit 
committee. Above all, make sure your auditor is independent. To maintain 
independence in the auditing of your financial statements, you should put 
your nonprofits audit out to bid every three to five years.
Requiring a signed financial statement
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires the chief executive officer (CEO) and the chief 
financial officer (CFO) to certify the appropriateness of financial statements and 
that the statements fairly represent the organization’s financial condition and 
operations. The reason for this requirement is to shift the responsibility for the 
financial statements onto the CEO and CFO. Although signing off on a nonprofit’s 
financial statements isn’t legally required, doing so indicates management under-
stands and takes responsibility for the statements. Having said this, you should 
take an active role in preparing and analyzing your financial statements.
A signature from an officer of the organization is required on the financial state-
ments. Your signature indicates that the statements have been prepared accord-
ing to accounting principles and that they reflect your true financial position.

149
 Chapter 9: Staying in Nonprofit Compliance
Avoiding Activities that Can Call 
Your Compliance into Question
Certain acts by your executive director, employees, and board members may 
be misunderstood by the IRS and your constituents. Questionable activities 
usually involve deals with family members or friends, politics, and operat-
ing like a for-profit business. This section points out some actions that can 
potentially affect your compliance with GAAP, FASB, and SOX that you and 
people associated with your nonprofit should avoid.
Conflicts of interest
Participating in any activity that can potentially be considered a conflict of 
interest is something you and your staff want to avoid. A conflict of interest is 
a situation in which your service to the public is at odds with your own inter-
ests. Examples include lending money to executives, using nonprofit assets 
for your personal benefit, and giving benefits or services to someone in your 
family who doesn’t qualify.
Having family members on your nonprofit’s payroll may be considered a 
conflict of interest. Anytime nonprofit assets are used for personal gain, you 
tread very close to receiving excessive personal benefits. The IRS has penal-
ties and sanctions for excess personal benefits. Selling, exchanging, or leasing 
property between executive directors and board members or key employees 
should not be done.
Lobbying or supporting candidates
Politics is sticky stuff, no matter what line of business you’re in. To avoid any 
potential compliance problems and the possibility of losing your nonprofit 
status, the best advice I have is for you to steer clear of anything political. 
Trying to influence elections, votes, or legislation can cause the loss of your 
nonprofit status.
Every time you apply for federal or state grants, you’re asked about your lob-
bying activities. Although you can encourage folks to register to vote, you’re 
not supposed to influence how they vote. Only if you’re a social welfare orga-
nization are you free to get heavily involved in political campaign activities. 
Furthermore, don’t unduly influence politicians to promote your agenda or 
give you money.

150
Part II: Balancing Your Nonprofit Books 
 
As for politicking, supporting your favorite candidate by casting your one 
vote for them is okay. However, you threaten your nonprofit’s status if you go 
any further. Don’t use your organization’s Web site to promote a candidate 
and don’t distribute literature on behalf of a candidate. Unless you’re a social 
welfare organization, such as the American Cancer Society, steer clear from 
lobbying and politics. For more information about politics, lobbying, and sup-
porting candidates, visit the IRS’s Web site at www.irs.gov.
Unrelated business income
Unrelated business income is money earned for purposes outside the scope 
or reason for your nonprofit establishment. For example, if you organized 
your nonprofit to provide meals to the elderly, and then you decide to start 
selling the meals to the general public for a profit, this could cause a problem 
with the IRS and seriously jeopardize your nonprofit status. Because you’re 
helping people, the IRS has granted you tax-free status. If you start competing 
with businesses by selling your products for less, you disrupt the market-
place and present a problem for corporations and the IRS.
 
According to the IRS, you’re not supposed to compete with for-profit compa-
nies. The name of the game in business is to earn a profit. The name of the 
game for nonprofits is to provide a service or product to the general public to 
make life better. If you earn $1,000 or more doing unrelated things, you owe 
the IRS taxes.

Part III
Accounting 
for Nonprofit 
Situations

In this part . . .
T
his part covers everything related to the feds. Grant 
money is an important source of revenue for your 
nonprofit, so you need to know how to access that money. 
When keeping your nonprofit’s books, you need to pay 
special attention to the federal grant system if you receive 
any federal grant money. The feds have adopted their own 
rule book to keep up with grant dollars.
You need to make sure you comply with all the rules after 
you access grant money. Accountability needs to be at 
an all-time high for proper management, allocation, and 
handling of federal money. But don’t think that no one will 
check up on you. You have to prepare for a grant audit, 
which makes sure you’re spending Uncle Sam’s money 
wisely.
And what would a part dealing with the feds be without a 
discussion on taxes? But you’re a nonprofit, and you’re 
exempt from paying taxes, right? Well, not exactly. You 
still have to pay employee payroll taxes and file Form 990. 
Paying payroll taxes doesn’t have to be a burdensome 
task. As a matter of fact, you can do it yourself. You 
can also fill out your own Form 990 and save yourself 
some money.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the significant role of grants
▶ Identifying funding opportunities
▶ Following grant guidelines
M
ost nonprofit executives spend sleepless nights worrying about 
finances and wondering if donors will continue to support the orga-
nization’s mission. Have you been one of those directors or managers who 
tossed and turned wondering where the money for your next project is 
coming from?
Well, you don’t have to worry anymore. Why not consider other options 
to help fund your organization? What better way than with federal grants. 
Applying for and using federal grants are wise moves to secure more depend-
able sources of revenue. A federal grant is better than money in the bank. 
Although the check doesn’t come in the mail nor will Ed McMahon ring the 
doorbell, the money is reserved for you at the U.S. Treasury.
Some nonprofit directors openly express a disinterest in federal money. One 
of the reasons is that they don’t understand the process. Another reason is 
the stiff federal penalties and serious repercussion for abuse and misman-
agement of federal grant funds. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t attempt to operate 
a nonprofit without federal money. Why fight over the crumbs by begging 
the same foundations over and over for the same small pot of money? The 
federal government is holding our tax dollars, and it has set aside funding to 
fulfill the needs addressed by nonprofit charitable organizations like yours. 
You don’t have to wait any longer to take advantage of this money to help 
your organization.
I’m sure you’ve heard the cliché, “No romance without finances.” Well, 
receiving federal money does have strings attached. In this chapter, you 
discover how to romance the federal government and take advantage of the 
grant money available.

Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Grasping Why Federal Grant Money 
Is Important to Nonprofits
Finding money to fund your nonprofit’s projects can be a time-consuming 
and stressful experience. However, a significant amount of federal grant 
money is available if you know where to turn and how to apply for it.
If a for-profit business wants money, all it has to do is sell a product or ser-
vice. However, the current tax code is very specific about how nonprofits can 
obtain money. Federal grant money is particularly important for nonprofits 
for the following reasons:
 
✓ Grant money has been set aside for nonprofit use. Congress allocates 
our tax dollars to federal programs. Grant funds are allocated to states 
based on the following numbers:
 
• Unemployment rate
 
• Inmate population
 
• Low-birth rates
 
• Number of unwed mothers
 
• Juvenile delinquency statistics
 
• High school dropout rates
 
✓ The government relies on nonprofits to address the needs in their 
respective communities. Because of the nature of nonprofit organiza-
tions and their underlying purpose, the government looks to you to fill 
the gaps in society by addressing your community’s needs.
 
✓ Grant funds provide a stable, reliable cash flow for nonprofit organi-
zations. The funds allow nonprofits to focus on their missions and not 
worry about finances.
 
Every year, the federal government awards more than $450 billion in the form 
of grants that help to
 
✓ Further the common good by supporting nonprofit organizations so they 
can fulfill their intended purpose
 
✓ Expand social programs for educational and cultural enrichment
 
✓ Support human health and protect the environment
Unfortunately, grant dollars are susceptible to waste and abuse. Therefore, 
strict guidelines have been established to provide oversight of financial man-
agement of agencies’ programs that are supported by federal grants. Even 

155
 Chapter 10: Introducing Federal Grants
with all the strict guidelines and hoops to jump through, if your nonprofit 
isn’t taking advantage of this money, you’re losing out on funds that can 
make a real impact on your organization.
The 4-1-1 on Grants: Just the Basics
Right now people are sitting in federal offices writing and rewriting legisla-
tion, rules, and guidelines concerning federal grants for nonprofits. You may 
be overwhelmed by information overload and hate to read the fine print. You 
may be able to overlook some of it, but some of it is essential to knowing 
what your nonprofit needs to do to effectively account for federal money.
Federal grants are awarded for a specific project and require strict finan-
cial oversight. Because grants are closely monitored, you want to ensure 
you properly account for them. Not to worry: All you have to do is adhere 
to some basic guidelines. (Check out the “Managing Federal Grant Money: 
The Do’s and Don’ts” section for more specific advice about managing grant 
money.) As long as you know and understand the ground rules, you can effec-
tively account for grant funds.
This section gives you a clearer picture about federal grants and answers 
several questions, including what these grants are, who can take advantage 
of them, how to apply for these grants, and what you have to do if your non-
profit receives federal grant money.
Defining a federal grant
Before your nonprofit can take advantage of federal grant money, you first 
need to have a firm grasp on what federal grant money is. A federal grant 
is financial assistance in the form of money issued by the U.S. government 
to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by law. 
Federal grants are available to nonprofits depending on their ability to imple-
ment, manage, and meet the obligation.
 
To be eligible for federal grants based on federal law, your organization must 
meet the federal government’s definition of a nonprofit. A nonprofit organization 
means any corporation, trust, association, cooperative, or other organization that
 
✓ Is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or 
similar purposes in the public interest
 
✓ Is not organized primarily for profit
 
✓ Uses its net proceeds to maintain, improve, and/or expand its operations

156
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
If you’re lucky enough to get a grant, then you’re a grant recipient. A grant 
recipient is expected to
 
✓ Be a good steward of the grant money
 
✓ Use the grant money for intended purposes
 
✓ Keep copies of all bills and expenses paid for with the money
Finding and applying for federal 
grants for your nonprofit
If you’re like me, you receive tons of spam e-mails about grants to pay your 
bills, buy a house, start a business, and so on. In addition, I get phone calls 
daily from people seeking advice after they’ve been misled by e-mails and 
infomercials. Federal grants aren’t a joke or scam though. They’re given to 
organizations that fulfill a need in society. The federal government knows 
it can’t address people’s needs by itself; therefore, it awards grants to non-
profit organizations that benefit society.
Uncovering other (nongovernmental) 
stones for grant money
The government is the biggest grant maker in 
the nation, but there are some other large givers 
that I want you to consider. Many large corpo-
rations and foundations give grants too. For 
instance, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 
gives money for health services and education. 
Some large corporations make so much money 
that they give it away. Why? The more you 
make, the more taxes you have to pay. I sug-
gest you first look in your own community for 
grants to help your nonprofit. Identify any large 
corporations in your area and ask whether they 
have any sort of grant program for which your 
nonprofit may qualify.
Furthermore, some large corporations like 
Ford and Kellogg have sold so many cars 
(okay maybe not as many lately) and so much 
cereal that they owe the government lots of 
tax money. The companies have formed their 
own foundations to give the money to you and 
write it off as a tax deduction, rather than pay 
it to the government. Foundations like the Ford 
Foundation and W. K. Kellogg Foundation give 
millions of dollars away every year.
You can find information about all the founda-
tions in the world by visiting the Foundation 
Center’s Web site at www.foundation
center.org or by visiting your local library.

157
 Chapter 10: Introducing Federal Grants
 
So where can your nonprofit locate these federal grant monies? Three primary 
places to find grant opportunities for your nonprofit are
 
✓ Grants.gov: Grants.gov is the one-stop shop designed to provide a level 
playing field for all organizations. Every funding opportunity offered by 
the 26 federal agencies can be found at www.grants.gov.
 
✓ Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA): The catalog identifies 
funding opportunities by assigning a program number. If you have the 
CFDA number, looking up the federal program is fairly easy. You can find 
a hard-copy of the CFDA at your local library or check it out online at 
www.cfda.gov.
 
✓ The specific federal agency’s Web site: All 26 federal agencies have 
information on their respective Web sites about grant opportunities. A 
simple way to find any federal agency is to use an online search engine.
 
To position your organization to apply for federal loans, take a deep breath. 
Over the years, the U.S. government has made great strides in ensuring that 
the process is open to any nonprofit that qualifies by creating a one-stop 
shop. Unfortunately, accessing federal grant money isn’t as easy as shopping 
at your local discount store. However, the good news is all organizations 
follow the same steps:
 
1. Register with www.grants.gov.
 
2. Download a grant application package.
 
3. Submit your application online.
The waiting period for finding out whether you’ve been awarded a grant is 
usually three to six months.
Documenting where the money goes
If your nonprofit receives federal grant money, you can’t just throw a big 
party and start spending to your heart’s content. Federal regulations require 
strict documentation of grant expenses. Uncle Sam wants to know how and 
where you’re spending his money.
 
So why does Uncle Sam care how you’re spending the grant money? You have 
to document costs for verification purposes, both for requesting payment for 
expenses and for audit purposes. As your nonprofit incurs program expenses 
related to the grant, you need to account for every transaction with supporting 
documentation to justify and verify expenditures. In the wake of government 

158
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
accountability, federal grants are under serious scrutiny. Although opening 
a separate bank account for grant funds isn’t required, federal auditors and 
monitors require that nonprofits account for and keep track of every pur-
chase, sale, and payment separately.
 
Tracking expenses separately can help you gather financial information for 
reports required by the federal government. These reports monitor your prog-
ress (see Chapter 11 for more about required reports), and all discrepancies will 
be documented in audit findings (see Chapter 12 for more about grant audits).
Nonprofits must do the following to account for federal grants:
 
✓ Report quarterly and annually on the use of grant funds.
 
✓ Use grant funds only for the purpose intended.
 
✓ Keep records showing use of grant funds.
 
✓ Have supporting documentation showing use of grant funds (bank state-
ments, checks, invoices, paid bills, and receipts).
 
✓ Establish and maintain internal controls, which protect you from 
employee theft by segregating employees’ duties. (For more about inter-
nal controls, see Chapter 2.)
In federal terminology, these accountability practices are called administra-
tive requirements. Administrative requirements refer to matters common 
to grants in general, such as financial management, type and frequency of 
reports, and retention of reports.
 
It’s very important to dot your i’s and cross your t’s by leaving a paper trail 
for every transaction that uses grant money. Federal program managers and 
auditors want to know that you’re a good steward of federal monies. Believe 
it or not, the federal government wants to help you meet your organization’s 
mission. For every grant awarded, a budget is attached that shows how the 
money is supposed to be spent. Receiving a federal grant award is a con-
tractual agreement between your organization and the federal government. 
(Check out Chapter 8 for more on creating a budget.)
When you applied for the grant, you stated that you had a need; the government 
has signed a binding agreement with you to provide the necessary funds to address 
the need. Now your responsibility as the grant recipient is to properly account for 
every dollar by keeping backup documents that prove good stewardship.
Auditors and program managers will want to see the following documents:
 
✓ Grant receipts
 
✓ Grant-paid invoices

159
 Chapter 10: Introducing Federal Grants
 
✓ Bid quotes and records of procurements
 
✓ Time and attendance reports for employees
 
✓ Payroll (salary and fringe benefits) expenses
 
✓ Leases for equipment
 
✓ Contractual agreements
 
Being organized with these records helps when it comes time for audits and 
monitoring visits (see Chapter 12 for more on these). To help keep track of 
everything, organize all grant-related documents in a hard-copy file as well 
as in a computerized system (check out Chapter 4 for more about organizing 
your financial records).
Managing Federal Grant Money: 
The Do’s and Don’ts
For years, federal agencies had in-house rules governing the administration 
of grants awarded. These rules were confusing to grant recipients because 
they made managing grants a burdensome task. To alleviate this confusion, 
all 26 federal agencies convened and came up with universal administrative 
procedures and rules that apply to organizations based on their structural 
classification (how you were formed at startup). The Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB), which evaluates the effectiveness of all federal programs, 
publishes and monitors these procedures.
The OMB has three circulars (government-speak for rule book) governing 
the accounting for, administering of, and auditing of grants. Circulars pro-
vide instruction and information, and are identified by the letter “A” and a 
number. The following sections take a closer look at these three circulars 
and their regulations; you can call them the do’s and don’ts of accounting 
for grants.
 
Don’t get bogged down with the detailed information in these circulars or 
be intimidated by them. You only need to know a few ground rules, most of 
which will be included in your award letter. If you stick with your approved 
budget and talk with your program manager about anything that concerns 
you, you’ll be okay.
 
In addition, most federal agencies offer periodic training about how you 
should manage your grant. Talk with your program manager about grant man-
agement training.

160
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
2 CFR Part 215 for administrative 
requirements
The 2 CFR Part 215 circular (formerly known as Circular A-110) addresses all 
nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and hospitals, and 
lays out the specific rules for administrative requirement concerning federal 
grants. This Code of Federal Regulations Part 215 is important because it out-
lines the dance steps Uncle Sam wants you to follow if you want to keep the 
federal grant money flowing.
In an effort to ensure all nonprofits are treated the same, this circular sets 
standards outlining the administration of grants. It prohibits federal awarding 
agencies from imposing additional or inconsistent requirements on you. This 
circular also includes
 
✓ Definitions of key terms used throughout the circular.
 
✓ Pre-award requirements about different types of forms, public notice of 
grant opportunity, and whether there is a state single point of contact. 
(The state single point of contact is a designated person in your state who 
should be notified that you’re applying to the federal government for 
funding.)
 
✓ Post-award requirements that explain financial and program management. 
(For more information about managing your grant, see Chapter 11.)
 
✓ Closeout procedures for reports and grant extensions.
Also, your nonprofit is expected to have written policies and procedures 
indicating that you don’t discriminate against anyone based on race, sex, 
religion, or origin. Your auditor will want to see your organization’s writ-
ten Equal Employment Opportunity Plan. You can view a copy of 2 CFR 215 
Uniform Administrative Requirements online at www.access.gpo.gov/
nara/cfr/waisidx_06/2cfr215_06.html.
OMB Circular A-122 for cost principles
OMB Circular A-122 is used by all federal agencies to determine the cost of 
work performed by nonprofit organizations. This circular contains informa-
tion about cost treatment and consistency of applying rules to determine 
whether costs should be charged to a grant. You can look here to read the 
detailed do’s and don’ts concerning what to buy and not buy. Your auditor 
will check to see whether all of your costs are in compliance with generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the cost principles outlined in 
OMB A-122.

161
 Chapter 10: Introducing Federal Grants
Costs are classified as reasonable, allocable, and allowable.
 
✓ Reasonable cost: A reasonable cost isn’t any higher than what an aver-
age person would pay under the same circumstances. In other words, just 
because Uncle Sam is paying, doesn’t mean you buy the most expensive 
items. Treat the grant like your personal cash and exercise good judgment.
 
✓ Allocable cost: An allocable cost is chargeable to a grant because the 
expense is incurred specifically for the grant, benefits both the grant 
and other work, or is necessary to the nonprofit’s operations.
 
✓ Allowable cost: A cost reimbursable by the federal government in accor-
dance with the cost principles is an allowable cost. However, the cost 
must also pass other tests (for example, it must be allocable, reason-
able, necessary, and consistently applied).
Just because your salary is paid out of the grant doesn’t mean you can set it 
at any amount. Anyone paid out of a grant should be paid a reasonable salary 
based on the market and location. The Department of Labor has information 
on its Web site about how much positions pay, based on location. Before 
you accept a contract to hire someone or set your own salary, take a look at 
the following Web site to make sure the wages are reasonable for your area: 
www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages.
Keep this circular on your bookshelf to use as a reference when you have 
burning questions about which costs are okay to charge against your grant. 
To print a copy of OMB A-122, go to www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/
omb/circulars/a122/a122_2004.pdf.
OMB Circular A-133 for government 
audit requirements
I can’t overstress the importance of accountability when spending Uncle 
Sam’s money. A good practice is to dot every i and cross every t by following 
the rules. An audit of your grant files should prove that you’re a good man-
ager and can be trusted to do what’s right. The OMB Circular A-133 for audit 
requirements addresses these rules. You need to know about this circular 
so you know what to expect before, during, and after an audit. (You can also 
check out Chapter 12 for more on a grant audit.)
You’re required to keep track of everything related to your grant by keeping 
copies of all grant documents. Your auditor and/or monitor will want to see 
what you bought and how much you paid for it. The audit will verify whether 
you followed administrative requirements and cost principles (see the pre-
ceding two sections for more on these).

162
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
You’re spending federal money that comes out of the U.S. Treasury. The fed-
eral government wants to make sure you’re spending it for the intended pur-
pose and that you’re following the rules and guidelines. For more information 
about OMB A-133 check out the following Web site: www.whitehouse.gov/
omb/circulars/index.html.
If you don’t follow the rules in this circular, you may face one of the following 
consequences:
 
✓ Disallowance: If your agency is disallowed, you lose your rights to get a 
grant.
 
✓ Debarments: If your organization is debarred, it loses its right to serve 
the community. It’s like taking away a lawyer’s right to practice law.
 
✓ Sanctions: If you fail to follow the rules, the government may charge you 
fines and penalties, and make you pay back the money you misspent. 
This is called imposing a sanction.
 
✓ Restrictions: If you face restrictions, the feds are going to watch closely 
how you spend every dime.
 
✓ Federal prosecution: The worse scenario for breaking the rules is to be 
prosecuted and sent to jail.
 
By the way, only a few nonprofits make the debarment list. The list is very 
short, but as a grant recipient, you shouldn’t do business with anyone on the 
list. Ask your federal grant manger for a copy of the Excluded Parties List or 
go to the following Web site: www.epls.gov.
 
Not knowing the rules doesn’t exempt nonprofit organizations from stiff pen-
alties for abusing taxpayers’ dollars. It’s imperative that you keep adequate 
records (for three years after the grant) as to how each dollar was spent. 
Every invoice, bill, voucher, and check written should be copied to the grant 
files. All you have to do is spend the money for the reason you got it.
Working Through the Details 
of Your Grant Agreement
Grants are similar in many ways. They all have reporting requirements that 
can make your head spin. But after you understand the requirements, it’s 
like learning to ride a bike. Your Notice of Grant Award (NGA) defines the 

163
 Chapter 10: Introducing Federal Grants
grant agreement relationship between the federal government and your 
organization. The purpose of the relationship is to transfer money to you so 
you can accomplish the common good.
You may get a letter or an e-mail with a downloadable file about your grant 
award. In the letter you’ll find important information about the terms of your 
grant award. Think of the terms as the rules of the grant game. You can’t play 
the game if you don’t know the rules.
The Notice of Grant Award discloses the terms of the grant agreement and 
guidelines for proper management of the grant by stating the
 
✓ Budget summary
 
✓ Due dates for financial status reports
 
✓ Special conditions of the award
 
✓ Award/project period
 
✓ Treatment of program income
 
✓ Indirect cost rate
 
✓ Federal share and nonprofit share (cost-sharing/match)
The following sections help you work through the details of your grant agree-
ment. Following the rules is easy when you understand them.
Summarizing the grant budget
The budget summary helps you know how the government expects you to 
manage your grant. It indicates costs and revenues linked to grant activities 
and helps you monitor and control grant funds. The budget provides a clear 
indication of grant performance.
The budget summary indicates how much money has been allocated to each 
category. The typical budget summary includes the following accounts in the 
following order:
 
✓ Personnel
 
✓ Fringe benefits
 
✓ Travel
 
✓ Equipment
 
✓ Supplies
 
✓ Contractual
 
✓ Construction
 
✓ Other
 
✓ Indirect costs

164
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Knowing the due dates for 
financial status reports
Unless otherwise noted in the special conditions (see the next section), finan-
cial status reports are due quarterly, annually, and at the end of the project 
period to close out the grant. The quarterly due dates are
Reporting Quarter 
Due Date
January 1–March 31 
May 15
April 1–June 30 
August 14
July 1–September 30 
November 14
October 1–December 31 
February 14
To submit your financial status reports, use Standard Form 269 (SF-269), 
which is the most common financial report. It lists all expenditures from the 
grant money and the running grant balance. I cover this form in greater detail 
in Chapter 11.
Indicating special conditions
Pay attention to the Notice of Grant Award regarding any special conditions 
included in the agreement. Special conditions are rules that are usually num-
bered on the grant award notice. For example, I received an award letter stat-
ing that the agency had approved my grant request, but it imposed a special 
condition stating that I had to add another location to do training. After I sat-
isfied the special condition, it was removed by the awarding agency.
Sometimes a grant applicant may have some issues that warrant special con-
ditions placed on them by the awarding agency. A high-risk nonprofit may 
face special conditions. If a nonprofit has a history of poor performance, isn’t 
financially stable, or lacks some responsibility in management systems, the 
federal agency may award the nonprofit a grant because the nonprofit is sup-
porting a good cause, but impose special conditions because of the organiza-
tion’s problems.
A common condition of receiving a federal grant requires you to submit 
progress reports. The Performance Progress Report (SF-PPR) tells how many 
people you’ve helped with the federal dollars. These reports are used by 
Congress to determine whether the money is making a difference in the lives 
of the people it aims to help. Head to Chapter 11 for more about completing 
progress reports.

165
 Chapter 10: Introducing Federal Grants
Keeping the award/project period in mind
Your grant has a beginning date and an ending date, which is called your proj-
ect period. Your project period may range from one to three years. I always 
mark both my wall and electronic calendars to keep up with grant project 
periods. It’s important to know how much time you have to spend your money.
 
If you forget to spend the money, it goes back to the federal government. Make 
sure you don’t let a grant expire without using the funds.
Treatment of program income
Depending on how much grant money you get, holding the money in your 
organization’s bank account can generate program income in the form of inter-
est paid on the money. Some programs supported by grants receive additional 
money through donations or fees for services. Money earned that is directly 
generated by grant-supporting activity is also called program income.
 
Earning more than $250 of interest income can result in you having to pay the 
money back. The government allows you to keep the first $250 of interest earned 
on grant money. You report interest earned when you file your grant reports, and 
interest over $250 will be treated as a grant distribution to you. Always talk with 
your program manager if you’re concerned about program income.
Figuring your indirect cost rate
While you’re running your grant program, you’re incurring costs of normal 
operations. A portion of the cost for telephone, lights, gas, rent, and other 
overhead expenses may be charged to the grant as an indirect cost. (An indi-
rect cost is a necessity of doing business, and you incur them whether you 
run one or three programs.) To get an indirect cost rate, you have to submit a 
request for it to the federal government. Based on the information submitted 
about your overhead expenses, the government will give you an indirect cost 
rate, which is a percentage of all of your expenses to operate your nonprofit.
Federal and nonprofit shares
Unfortunately, sometimes not all of the costs to run a program are paid in 
full by the grant. Some grants require a match. A grant match is when your 
nonprofit pays a percentage of the total award. I like to think of it as sharing 

166
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
the expense. The Notice of Grant Award will indicate the amount the federal 
agency pays (called the federal share) and what, if any, the nonprofit must 
match (called the nonprofit share).
For example, if you submit a grant application stating it will cost you $100,000 
to run your program, the granting agency may want you to pay 10 percent of 
that amount. Your 10 percent of the cost will be $10,000, and the 90 percent 
federal share will be $90,000.
 
Match requirements are listed in the grant announcement or notice of funding 
availability. Therefore, you’ll know before applying for funding that a match 
is required. You can account for the nonprofit share of the match when you 
submit the budget with your application.
Sometimes your match can be contributed in ways other than cash. For 
instance, you may want to use the salary of one of your employees as a 
match. If a significant percentage of the person’s time is spent working on the 
grant program, this is allowable.
The following can be used as a nonprofit share:
 
✓ Cash
 
✓ In-kind donations of supplies, services, or personnel costs
 
✓ Program income (gross revenue earned by a grant-supported program)
 
✓ Unrecovered indirect costs (the difference between the amount awarded 
and the amount which could have been awarded under the recipient’s 
approved indirect cost rate; see the preceding section for more on indi-
rect cost rates)
 
✓ A combination of these

o ahead and celebrate. You worked hard and you received the federal 
grant. You’ve been awarded grant funding to establish, develop, and 
implement a project for your organization. Now you have to manage your 
grant. Get ready for tons of paperwork, but don’t worry; I walk you through 
the whole process in this chapter. After you find out what really matters, 
you’ll be on your way to managing the fed’s money in your sleep.
Your underlying responsibility is to understand your obligations to the fed-
eral government and your awarding agency. After you know what’s expected 
of you, you can follow the directions your awarding agency gives you.
In this chapter, I give you some tips on how to stay on top of your federal 
grant game. This includes spending the money according to the grant budget; 
complying with the awarding agency’s requirements by submitting all reports 
on time; and knowing how to close out the grant. If you’re thinking that you’ll 
be dealing with lots of paperwork, you’re right. After all, you know that every-
thing the government does involves lots of paper. (I focus on federal grants in 
this chapter; if you’re curious about grants from sources other than the fed-
eral government, see the “Defining the difference between private and public 
grants” sidebar in this chapter.)

Understanding Your Obligation
As grant recipient, you’ve agreed to fulfill a need in society, and the federal 
government has agreed to give you the money to do so. As a grant recipient, 
you’re responsible for
 
✓ Managing the money: This can be a fun part of the job and includes
 
• Ensuring grant funds are spent according to the grant budget
 
• Monitoring grant activity and expenses
 
• Ensuring that grant funds aren’t returned to the awarding agency
Defining the difference between 
private and public grants
You need to be aware of a few key differences 
between the application, review, and manage-
ment processes of grants offered by private cor-
porations and foundations (commonly referred 
to as private grants) versus those offered by the 
government (commonly referred to as public 
grants). How you track and manage your grants 
depend on the grant maker’s terms. Everything 
that deals with the government, including its 
grant process, is very detailed and thorough, 
and information is easily accessible at www.
grants.gov. On the other hand, corporate 
grant makers may not be as organized or open 
as the government in terms of grant details. 
Information about private grants may not be in 
one central location. Foundations and corpora-
tions may choose to advertise grant opportuni-
ties on their Web sites, but they may not.
Government grants are well defined and com-
petitive, and you can request feedback if your 
grant application isn’t funded. The grant pro-
cess for public grants involves a peer review, 
in which a panel of at least three individuals 
reviews your application. This panel scores 
your application according to a predetermined 
numbering system that you receive before you 
turn in your application. This process is the 
same for every applicant, which ensures a cer-
tain level of consistency.
Private grants are a little different. Each award-
ing entity has the freedom to define its own 
grant process. Corporations usually have more 
leniency in the way they award, administer, and 
manage grants. Corporate funders set the rules 
and change them as they see fit. For example, a 
corporation may choose to give your nonprofit a 
check with no strings attached, or it may have a 
detailed process you have to follow throughout 
the duration of your grant.
Many community foundations are a bit more 
structured than corporations in terms of their 
grant processes. They often have grants that 
donors set up for specific purposes. These donors 
may even stipulate how the grant recipient should 
use the money. Some of the larger foundations, 
such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Ford 
Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and Mary 
Reynolds Babcock Foundation, use grant pro-
cesses similar to those of the government.
Whether your grant has been awarded by a 
corporation, foundation, or government agency, 
make sure you find out all the rules you need to 
follow so you don’t lose your grant.

 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
 
✓ Handling the paperwork: I know you don’t want to be a paper pusher, 
but if you’re going to spend the government’s money, you have to keep 
track of every detail. Here’s what you have to do:
 
• Prepare and file reports on time
 
• Maintain detailed documentations and records
 
✓ Running the program according to your application: This is likely the 
most rewarding part of managing the grant. You get to help people improve 
their lives, which is probably why you got into this field in the first place.
 
If you don’t take care of these three aspects according to the grant guidelines, 
you can lose your funding. How you manage the money, fill out the paperwork, 
and run your program establish your organization’s reputation with the fed-
eral government. If you poorly manage your grant, your awarding agency may 
give you additional reporting requirements that you have to meet for the dura-
tion of your grant. For instance, if you develop a history of poor performance 
and financial instability, your program manager may require you to present 
reports more often than quarterly or semiannually. (See Chapter 12 for more 
about special conditions and grants.)
I cover the money and paperwork aspects of grants in the rest of this chapter. I 
leave the managing of the grant program up to you. I know you can handle it.
Managing Grant Funds
Grant money is another form of income for your nonprofit, but you can’t just 
throw it in the pot with all the other cash and do whatever you want to with 
it. You have to keep track of the grant funds so the awarding agency knows 
you did what you said you were going to do with the funds and didn’t fritter 
the money away.
In the following sections, I explain how to manage your grant money sepa-
rately from your other income and expenses, and how you go about getting 
the money that’s been awarded to you.
 
If you need help setting up a system to help you manage your money, turn to 
Chapter 4. A good financial management system helps you record and track 
expenses, maintain records, and balance your grant budget.
Maintaining a separate budget 
for your grant dollars
When you received your Notice of Grant Award (see Chapter 10 for more on 
this), it included a grant budget. Your grant budget tells you how the federal 

170
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
government expects you to spend the money. You’re expected to be a wise 
steward and to exercise good judgment when making decisions about what 
to buy and how much to pay.
Within your nonprofit, you need to keep a separate budget and set up sepa-
rate accounts for your grant money. Your award letter comes with a grant 
budget that shows how much money you received and what you can and 
should do with it. This budget may be the same as or very similar to the 
budget you submitted with your grant application. You need to keep track 
of what you buy with the grant money so you can prove to your award-
ing agency and your auditor that you used the money according to the set 
budget. Keeping copies of all paperwork, especially receipts of purchase, per-
taining to the grant is a good idea.
 
Pay attention to your grant period, because if you don’t spend the money 
during the specified grant period on approved purchases, the awarding 
agency gets it back, and you lose everything you didn’t spend.
Keeping separate accounts is important when you receive a federal grant 
because you need to avoid commingling funds, which means mixing grant 
money with your organization’s other sources of income. Commingling of 
funds is one of the audit findings that can cause you to lose funding. (For 
more about grant audits, see Chapter 12.) Include your grant programs in 
your chart of accounts by assigning each program a different control number. 
Doing so solves the problem of mixing up the money. (For more information 
about setting up a chart of accounts for your nonprofit, see Chapter 5.)
If you’re feeling a bit unsure about how to keep everything separate, you may 
want to set up a completely separate bank account for your grant money, 
which you can do at your local bank.
 
Someone has to oversee the project’s progress and funding. Depending on 
how much money you received and your other responsibilities, you may want 
to consider hiring someone to manage the project’s funding.
Making changes to your grant
Okay, nothing is written in stone. Things change, people move, prices go up 
and down; as a result, nothing in the budget is absolute. If you need to make 
budget changes, contact your program manager and ask for a grant adjust-
ment notice (GAN). A grant adjustment notice gives you written authoriza-
tion to make changes to your grant agreement. These changes can be actual 
changes to your budget, extensions of the funding period, or changes in per-
sonnel, among others.
If you need to make a change to your budget that requires a grant adjust-
ment notice, you need to call your program manager and request the form. 

171
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
Following up this call with an e-mail to verify the request is always a good 
idea. After your program manager approves the changes, you receive a grant 
adjustment notice by mail; add the notice to your grant files.
 
Get all approved changes to your grant agreement in writing. Documentation 
is important for you to have so you can justify all of your actions pertaining to 
the grant.
Check with your program manager about the 10 percent rule for budgetary 
changes. The 10 percent rule states that you can move up to 10 percent of 
your budget money (10 percent of the total grant amount) from one budget 
category to another without prior approval, as long as you don’t create a new 
budget category.
Handling the responsibility of subgrantees
Subgrantees are the organizations that form a partnership with the lead agency, 
or grantee, to apply for the grant. If you’re the lead agency, you’re responsible for 
overseeing the financial management of yourself and the subgrantees. You estab-
lish this relationship through a subaward of your grant to your subgrantee.
The grantor is the federal agency that awards and establishes a grant agree-
ment with the grantee through the Notice of Grant Award (see Chapter 10 for 
more on this document). The grantee may have partners that it included in 
the grant budget as subgrantees.
Subgrantees answer directly to the grantee and seldom have any direct contact 
with the grantor. The grantee establishes a grant agreement with the subgrantee 
similar to the agreement that the grantor has with the grantee. The grantee 
authorizes all payments submitted for reimbursement to the grantor and makes 
drawdowns from the grantor for both themselves and the subgrantees.
The grantee submits all reporting requirements to the grantor. The grantee 
places reporting requirements on the subgrantee. The grantee is responsible 
for overseeing not only the actions of its nonprofit but also the actions of the 
subgrantees.
For example, consider the following situation: United Way partners with the 
Red Cross on a $100,000 grant that the U.S. Department of Education awards 
United Way. The U.S. Department of Education is the grantor. United Way is 
the grantee and lead agency, and the Red Cross is the subgrantee. If a prob-
lem with how the money is managed comes up during the grant’s duration, 
the responsibilities lie with United Way. If the Red Cross spends money care-
lessly, United Way is responsible for that careless spending because United 
Way had to approve and make all drawdowns for the Red Cross. If the Red 
Cross performs poorly, United Way has to carefully approve or disapprove 
its requests for payment.

172
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Creating the grant agreement for subgrantees
Whether you call it an agreement or a contract, you need to have something 
in writing that states the terms of your agreement with the subgrantees — 
how much money you’ll allocate, to whom you will allocate the money, what 
the money should be used for, and when you will allocate it.
The authorized representative of your organization should sign the agree-
ment. Your authorized representative is the person responsible for the 
overall management of your grant, usually your organization’s director. Keep 
in mind that your executive director doesn’t have to administer or manage 
the program, but he is responsible for it. Also, the agreement should state 
when financial and progress reports are due from your subgrantees (see 
the “Reporting Requirements” section in this chapter for more about these 
reports).
Double trouble in Macon
The city of Macon, Georgia, has double 
trouble with managing its grants. Both the 
U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have 
disallowed questionable expenses and ordered 
the city to repay misappropriated funds. In addi-
tion, a U.S. attorney has threatened the city with 
a $1 million lawsuit.
In 2002, the Department of Justice awarded 
$900,000 to the city for a Safe Schools Initiative 
grant. In reality, the city kept only $170,000 of 
the total grant award because the city included 
several subgrantees in its grant budget. The 
city administered the remaining $730,000 among 
partners made up of faith-based organizations. 
The Department of Justice was the grantor, the 
city of Macon was the grantee, and the faith-
based organizations were the subgrantees. 
The city of Macon was responsible for approv-
ing payments submitted by its partners. After 
an audit of the city’s records, the Department 
of Justice found that the city lacked neces-
sary documentation to support expenditures of 
$350,000. As a result, the city of Macon had to 
pay back $350,000 for false claims it submitted 
to the Department of Justice.
The Department of Justice didn’t go after the 
faith-based organizations because, as the 
grantee, the city was responsible for adminis-
tering and managing the money — it had the 
right and responsibility to refuse false claims 
submitted by the faith-based organizations.
In addition to the debacle with the Department 
of Justice, the city of Macon found itself in trou-
ble with another grantor, FEMA. FEMA awarded 
the city a grant to remove debris from severe 
flooding. In 2004, the Office of Inspector General 
(OIG) reported that $126,911 of the city’s claims 
were excessive or duplicate charges against 
the grant. The problems that FEMA uncovered 
in Macon included double billing, overcharg-
ing for overtime, not having documentation to 
support expenses charged to the grant, and 
submitting false claims. The OIG disallowed the 
$126,911 of questioned costs, and the city had to 
come up with the money on its own.

173
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
Generally, grantees give subgrantees a deadline of two weeks before the 
reports are due to the grantor. As the lead agency or grantee, your financial 
reports are due 45 days after the end of the quarter. Therefore, if you’re 
managing subgrantees, you should give them a deadline of 30 days to submit 
their financial reports to you. Your Performance Progress Report (SF-PPR) 
is due to the awarding agency 30 days after the end of the reporting period 
(see the “Reporting Requirements” section of this chapter for more about 
this report). Therefore, you should give your subgrantees 15 days to get their 
progress reports to you. Your subgrantees send information to you, and then 
you send it, along with your own reports, to the grantor or awarding agency.
Monitoring and verifying subgrantees’ reports
As the lead agency, your responsibility is to monitor the reports that the 
subgrantees submit. Some questions to ask yourself when looking over these 
bills and documents include the following:
 
✓ Are the expenses the subgrantees submitted to you in the budget?
 
✓ Are the costs associated with the project?
 
✓ Do the subgrantees have an adequate accounting system?
Make sure you keep copies of all the paperwork your subgrantees send 
you. You may need it later to justify money paid to subgrantees. As the lead 
agency, you’re responsible for managing both your own transactions and 
those of your subgrantees. You answer to the grantor if questions about your 
subgrantees’ expenses arise.
 
When a subgrantee submits a claim for reimbursement to you, you need to 
review the expenses and check to see whether they’re in the budget before 
you approve expenses. If the expenses aren’t listed in the subgrantee’s 
budget, you have to deny the claim. I’ve had claims submitted in which sub-
grantees try to use grant money to pay for something totally unrelated to 
the purpose of the project. Always compare the expenses to both the grant 
budget and the guidelines set in the grant award document.
Drawing Down Federal Dollars
The federal government doesn’t send you a check for the total amount of your 
grant upfront. In fact, most federal agencies reimburse you rather than pay you in 
advance, so as a grant recipient, you have to request the money after you spend it.
 
This setup reminds me of the old saying “You have to have money to make 
money.” When you’re a grant recipient, you need to have some front money to 
spend before you can start receiving the grant dollars.

174
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Before you can gain access to your grant money, you need to submit some 
information authorizing your bank to process the drawdown. The drawdown 
is the process by which you request your grant money from the awarding 
agency. You have to submit paperwork to the bank to authorize the transfer 
of funds into your bank account. After you submit this paperwork, you can 
begin moving money into your organization’s bank account.
Inside your award package, you should find forms to set up electronic transfers 
from the U.S. Treasury to your bank account. You need to fill out these forms and 
send them to the awarding agency. You need to include your bank routing 
number, the name of your bank, your account number, the contact person — 
all the information you use when you authorize an electronic transfer.
 
After you set up your bank account to receive money from the government’s 
account, you can start requesting drawdowns. You need the following infor-
mation to request a drawdown:
 
✓ Grant ID number: Each grant awarded has a grant ID number, which the 
federal agency giving you the money assigns to you.
 
✓ Employer identification number: Your employer identification number 
(EIN) is the identifying number the IRS assigns to you for tax purposes.
 
✓ Amount of money requested: You need to know exactly how much 
money you’re requesting. Keep invoices and bills to justify your 
requests.
 
✓ Time period the money was used: You need to know during which 
period your organization spent the money. For example, the period cov-
ered by this request can be a week, month, or quarter.
 
As you request drawdowns throughout the grant period, keep track in your 
own files of how much money has been drawn and how much money is left 
to be drawn (for more information on tracking your records, turn to the 
“Tracking the electronic transfer” section in this chapter). Make sure your 
records coincide with the numbers in your grant budget.
Transferring grant money
You can request or draw down your federal grant money either by telephone 
or over the Internet. Use whichever method you’re more comfortable with:
 
✓ Telephone method: Requesting grant money over the telephone is a 
paperless method. You can find the number to call to request grant 
money inside your grant award package. After you dial this number, the 
system prompts you for the information I describe in the preceding sec-
tion. Unfortunately, you don’t speak to an actual person.

175
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
 
 One disadvantage to the telephone method is that it can leave you won-
dering whether your request actually transmitted because you don’t 
receive documentation verifying the transaction. But, you can create 
your own spreadsheet of the drawdown. See the “Tracking the elec-
tronic transfer” section for how to set up a spreadsheet.
 
✓ Internet method: To use the Internet to request your grant money, 
you first need to set up an online account with the federal agency that 
awarded you the money; you do this by creating a password and user 
ID. Note that periodically you’ll be prompted to change your password.
 
 Of course, you need to keep your current password and user ID in a 
secure place so you can find them quickly. After all, you don’t want to 
be in the middle of processing your payment when the system times out 
because you can’t find your password (the Internet times out when you 
take too long to complete a certain action). Make sure your information 
is handy so you can successfully complete the process.
 
 Unlike the telephone method, the Internet method enables you to print 
out a receipt of your request. For this reason, I prefer the Internet method.
Sometimes you’re given a choice as to which method you want to use. Look 
in your Notice of Grant Award for specific instructions on how to draw down 
funds.
 
Documentation is very important when working with a large agency like the 
federal government. Keeping copies of all transactions and communications, 
especially the drawdowns you’ve requested and received, is essential to 
proper documentation. Doing so also helps you track and monitor your grant 
balances. So if you choose the telephone method, create your own records of 
the transactions you make.
Tracking the electronic transfer
One way to track electronic transfers is to create a spreadsheet of every 
drawdown requested. In this spreadsheet, you want to record the date of the 
request, the time of the request, the amount requested, and the time period 
covered (flip to Chapter 4 for pointers on creating a spreadsheet). Updating 
your spreadsheets at least on a monthly basis is a good idea. Waiting longer 
than one month can cause you to get behind and lose track of what’s what. 
These up-to-date spreadsheets help you when you have to fill out your quar-
terly financial reports. See the “Reporting Requirements” section for more 
about filling out your financial reports.
In addition to the spreadsheet, you should print out and create a hard-copy 
file of every transaction you request. This file needs to coincide with your 
budget balance for the grant.

176
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
 
If you want assurance that you and your award agency have the same bal-
ances, you can request a grant summary from your federal program manager. 
A grant summary is a printout of all of your grant transactions according to the 
awarding agency’s records. You can double-check your records against the 
government’s records anytime you need to.
Knowing when to request a drawdown
If your budget is tight, you need to carefully track how much time the U.S. 
Treasury can take to move the money to your bank account. In today’s age of 
electronics, things can be transmitted instantly, but sometimes the govern-
ment doesn’t move that fast. So you need to pay attention to the timing.
 
Sometimes the last five days of the month are the busiest for the federal 
agency because everybody is trying to close out the month and process pay-
ments. For this reason, you shouldn’t wait until the last week of the month to 
request a money transfer. If you do wait until the end of the month to request 
your grant money, expect to wait a little longer to receive it. Like banks, the 
U.S. Treasury isn’t open every day. Most agencies tell you that moving money 
takes five working days, but sometimes you have to wait a little longer.
How long processing a payment request takes depends on whether your non-
profit is the grantee or the subgrantee. If you’re the subgrantee, you have to 
wait for the grantee to receive payment from the grantor before you receive 
your money. How fast the grantee receives payment depends on the account-
ing procedures your awarding agency has in place. For instance, if your 
awarding agency is a large state agency that has a separate finance depart-
ment, you may find that the department takes more time to process the reim-
bursement than does a smaller agency with fewer requests.
Reporting Requirements
Everyone has to report to someone, and that’s especially true when you’re 
spending Uncle Sam’s money. After reading your grant agreement and/or 
award letter, you should know how many reports you have to submit and 
when you need to submit them. You can’t avoid the paperwork. The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) hands down these requirements. The OMB 
sets the standards for administering, managing, and auditing federal dollars.
Most grants require that you submit the following two reports to the award-
ing agency:

177
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
 
✓ A financial status report, called the Standard Form 269: Your financial 
status report gives a brief summary of how much money was awarded, 
how much money was spent, and how much money you have left in your 
budget. This report is filed quarterly and when you close out your grant.
 
✓ Progress reports, called the Standard Form PPR (Performance Progress 
Report): These reports tell the feds whether you’re making progress 
toward the program’s goals and objectives. These reports are submitted 
semiannually.
 
You have to file these financial status reports even if you don’t spend any 
money during the given quarter. Just fill in zeros if you haven’t spent any 
money. Your program manager will keep a close eye on your program’s prog-
ress. If you have questions about anything pertaining to your grant, contact 
your program manager. In the following sections, I explain in detail how to 
complete and submit both of these reports.
Most federal programs have an annual grant management meeting where 
you’re given guidelines about how to manage your grant and have an oppor-
tunity to meet folks from other nonprofits that received the same grant. 
These annual meetings can help you manage your programs better and offer 
networking opportunities for you to find out more about other grants that 
may be available for your nonprofit.
 
You must file reports on time. The consequences of not filing your reports on 
time can be detrimental to your organization. If you stop the flow of paper-
work, the federal government stops the flow of money. Therefore, if you don’t 
submit reports, you don’t receive your money. Mark your calendar, program 
your PDA, send yourself reminders, do whatever you need to do to remember 
what is due and when.
Financial Standard Form 269
The most important report you have to submit to your federal grantor is the 
Financial Status Report, which you complete using Standard Form 269 (SF-269). 
Financial Status Reports (FSRs) tell your grantor how much you’ve spent in the 
current quarter versus prior quarters and how much you have left in your budget. 
Financial Status Reports are due quarterly and when the grant period expires. For 
copies of FSRs, go to www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/sf269a.pdf.
Financial Status Reports come in both a short form (SF-269A) and a long form 
(SF-269). Each federal awarding agency requires using the SF-269 or SF269-A 
to report your financial status. I outline steps to help you fill out the short 
form of the grant Financial Status Report in the following sections. See Figure 
11-1 for a copy of SF-269A.

178
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
 
Figure 11-1: 
Financial 
Status 
Report — 
Standard 
Form 269A.
 
Filling out SF-269A
According to the OMB, the SF-269A takes about 90 minutes to complete. Each 
item on the form has a number or letter, which makes explaining it rather 
easy. The top portion of the form (numbers 1 through 9) covers information 
that identifies the federal agency, nonprofit organization, funding period, pay-
ment accounting method, and period (month or quarter, for example) cov-
ered by the financial report.

179
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
The following steps explain the items on the SF-269A and what to do for 
each one:
 
1. Federal Agency and Organizational Element to Which Report Is 
Submitted: Insert the name of the federal agency that awarded the grant.
 
2. Federal Grant or Other Identifying Number Assigned by Federal 
Agency: Write the grant number assigned by the federal agency, which 
you can find in your grant award package.
 
3. Recipient Organization (Name and complete address, including zip 
code): Write the name of your nonprofit and its complete address.
 
4. Employer Identification Number: Write your nonprofit’s federal 
employer identification number (FEIN or EIN).
 
5. Recipient Account Number or Identifying Number: Write your non-
profit’s self-identifying number (only if it has one).
 
 The recipient account number is a self-designated number you use in 
your nonprofit. If you’re managing several projects and need to separate 
them, you should assign each project an account number to help you. 
You can leave this box blank if it doesn’t apply to you.
 
6. Final Report: Check yes only if this is the final report.
 
 Financial Status Reports are submitted quarterly and at the close of the 
grant. At the end of a project, two reports are due: a report for financial 
quarterly activities and a final report. Usually these two reports have the 
same financial information. The only difference is that you check Yes on 
the final report.
 
7. Basis: Check either the Cash or Accrual box, depending on which 
method of accounting you use.
 
 If you account for transactions when cash changes hands or use your 
checkbook as your primary accounting system, check the cash box. If 
you record transactions when they take place, regardless of whether 
any cash has exchanged hands, check the accrual box. (See Chapter 2 
for more about cash and accrual methods of accounting.)
 
8. Funding/Grant Period: Write the beginning date of the grant in the From 
box and the ending date of the grant in the To box.
 
 
Make necessary adjustments for any grant extensions you’ve received.
 
 If you need an extension, request it at least three months before the 
grant closing date. Most federal programs run a little behind schedule at 
the beginning, so extensions are common. Most federal agencies are will-
ing to grant up to a one-year extension.
 
9. Period Covered by This Report: Write the dates of the period you’re 
covering with this report in the To and From boxes. Financial Status 
Reports are usually reported quarterly unless otherwise noted. See 

180
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
the chart of reporting periods and due dates in the “Submitting SF-269” 
section.
 
 If this is your final report, your time period is the entire grant period, 
from the beginning date to the closeout date, including all extensions.
 
10. Transactions: Fill out the following three columns:
 
I. Previously Reported: The cumulative amounts from the previous 
report. If this is the first report, this amount is zero.
 
II. This Period: The current amount expended for the reporting 
quarter.
 
III. Cumulative: The previously reported amount plus the amount for 
the current reporting period.
 
 For the following categories of transactions, you enter the amount of 
the transaction in one of the first two columns, depending on when the 
money was spent, and you enter the total for that category in the third 
column.
 
a. Total outlays: Enter the total amounts spent on the grant during 
the reporting quarter. Consider that your nonprofit spends $5,500 
in January, $6,500 in February, and $6,000 in March. Enter the total 
of $18,000 in the total outlays box for this period.
 
b. Recipient share of outlays: If you have a cost-sharing or match-
ing grant — in which you pay an agreed portion — you enter the 
amount you paid, according to agreement in the grant budget. If 
it’s not a cost-sharing or matching grant, enter zero.
 
 Sometimes the federal government doesn’t award the total cost to 
operate a program. Instead, you may be asked to pay a percent-
age of the cost. Grants in which you pay a portion of the costs are 
called cost-sharing or matching grants (see Chapter 10 for more on 
this concept).
 
c. Federal share of outlays: If this is not a matching grant, enter 
the amounts from a. If this is a matching grant, enter the amount 
charged to the grant and expected to be reimbursed by the federal 
agency.
 
d. Total unliquidated obligations: Enter the expenses that your sub-
grantees have incurred but that you haven’t yet paid. If you don’t 
have any, leave this box blank.
 
e. Recipient share of unliquidated obligations: Enter your portion of 
the total amount obligated if this is a matching grant. If this isn’t a 
matching grant, leave this box blank.
 
f. Federal share of unliquidated obligations: Enter the amount paid 
by the awarding agency for expenses that the subgrantees have 

181
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
incurred but that the agency hasn’t yet paid. If you don’t have any 
or if it’s a cost-sharing grant, leave this box blank.
 
 Although these expenses occurred within the Financial Status 
Report period, you may not have requested or paid the amounts 
yet. Reporting all expenses and allocating them to the quarter in 
which they occur is important.
 
g. Total federal share: Enter the sum of boxes c and f, for the current 
period.
 
h. Total federal funds authorized for this funding period: Enter your 
total grant amount awarded.
 
i. Unobligated balance of federal funds: Subtract line g from line h 
and enter that amount. This is your grant balance for this period.
 
 Most nonprofits fill in only a, b, c, g, h, and i.
 
11. Indirect Expense: Check the appropriate type of rate. This rate, com-
monly called an indirect cost rate, is a cost rate that helps cover some 
overhead administrative costs. Check with your program manager to get 
an allowance to pay indirect expenses. (See Chapter 10 for more about 
indirect cost rates.)
 
 Also, number 11 asks questions about your rate, base, total amount, and 
federal share of indirect cost rate. For 11(b), enter your current indirect 
cost rate. For 11(c), enter the amount you used to calculate your rate. 
For 11(d), enter the total amount of indirect costs. For 11(e), enter the 
federal share of the amount in 11(d).
 
12. Remarks: This box is usually not applicable. However, if your awarding 
agency has asked for any additional explanations, provide them here.
 
13. Certification: Be sure to acquire the correct signature on the SF-269A. 
Auditors will write you up if your Financial Status Reports aren’t signed, so 
make sure your director signs them. The signature certifies that the report 
is correct and that grant money has been spent according to guidelines.
 
When you account for grant expenditures on a monthly basis, you can copy 
the information for the SF-269 from your accounting system onto the form.
Submitting SF-269
Back in the day, we submitted the SF-269 by mail. After September 11, 2001, 
sending mail to the government became a difficult task. Often mail is returned 
with a black mark over it. Since then, many awarding agencies require that all 
grantees submit their financial reports electronically or by fax machine.
Unless otherwise noted, financial status reports are due according to the 
following table:

182
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Reporting Quarter 
Due Date
January 1–March 31 
May 15
April 1–June 30 
August 14
July 1–September 30 
November 14
October 1–December 31 
February 14
If you have the option to fax your financial status report, don’t wait until the 
due date to fax it. Not surprisingly, the fax machines usually go crazy on the 
due dates.
 
Sometimes fax machines jam and lock up, and federal employees have to turn 
them off. So, if your report is transmitting and the machine is off, your report 
probably won’t make it to the agency on time.
I once sent financial reports all three ways, by mail, fax, and the Internet, 
because I wanted to cover all the bases. No one wants to receive the dreaded 
message when she tries to draw down money — the message that states the 
government didn’t receive your Financial Status Reports, and, therefore, the 
government can’t process your request for grant money. I suggest that you 
do your reports online to expedite the process.
Progress reports
Your awarding agency wants to know how you’re doing with your grant proj-
ect, so periodically you have to submit a progress report. The progress report, 
which comes in many forms, states the status of achievements in accomplish-
ing project goals. The progress report indicates the status of the following:
 
✓ Equipment purchases
 
✓ Number of people served
 
✓ Amount of money spent
 
✓ Plans for spending the grant money
 
✓ Overall status of the grant project
Some reports include corrective actions or plans to resolve problems. After 
all, seldom does a program run according to schedule. The progress report 
provides you a place where you can explain program problems and ask for 
technical assistance from the grantor.

183
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
You can download the OMB’s progress reports, called the Performance 
Progress Reports (SF-PPRs), at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/
grants_forms.html.
Some federal agencies have their own reports, so check with your federal 
program manager about where to find copies of progress reports. You submit 
most progress reports online, and you can download them from your award-
ing agency’s Web site.
Completing your progress report
Filling out progress reports is fairly straightforward. Refer to Figure 11-2 for 
an example of a Performance Progress Report (SF-PPR). The top third of the 
form asks for basic information about you, your project, and the period cov-
ered. The middle section of the report is considered the narrative section. 
Here you provide specific details about your project’s progress within the 
last period. The bottom section is where you put your contact information 
and sign certifying that the report is correct and complete.

13. Agency use only 
Talk to your program manager about how much information you need to 
include in this report. Basically, your awarding agency wants to know num-
bers: how many people you served through your program, how many people 

184
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
participated, how many people directly benefited from your program, and so 
on. These numbers provide outcome measurements, which help the award-
ing agency decide your project’s overall efficacy so far.
I like to use brief condensed sentences that get to the point on these prog-
ress reports. Your awarding agency won’t be impressed with a novel about 
your program. One thing I’ve learned from dealing with federal employees is 
that they want only prevalent information. I suggest that you state the facts 
in numbers and percentages that indicate a reasonable amount of progress.
Refer back to your award letter and grant agreement for specific instructions 
about how often your program manager wants to know your status. Usually, 
progress reports cover a six-month period. Keep in mind, though, that some 
agencies may require progress reports on a different schedule, or they may 
ask for additional information (not covered on the progress report) about 
your project.
 
Pay attention to any special conditions listed in your award document. Special 
conditions deviate from the norm. For example, your awarding agency may 
want you to submit progress reports on a monthly or quarterly basis instead 
of semiannually. Read your award documents and follow the instructions the 
awarding agency gave you.
Submitting your progress report
Most grantees submit their progress reports online. As you do with SF-269, 
you have to set up a password and user ID to send your progress report 
online. Your awarding agency gives you all the instructions you need to 
submit your progress report online.
Progress reports are due 30 days after the end of the reporting period. 
Progress reports typically cover six months, usually from January through 
June and from July through December. Therefore, a report is due no later 
than July 30 for the period covering January 1 to June 30, and January 30 for 
the period covering July 1 to December 31. Look at your award letter to see 
exactly when your awarding agency wants you to submit all reports.
In addition to the semiannual progress reports, you have to do a final report 
at the closeout of the grant, which is due 90 days after the end date of the 
grant. See the next section for more information about closing out your grant.
 
Some agencies allow you to send progress reports by mail or fax machine. 
Keep in mind, though, that your program is just one of many programs over-
seen by the federal government. Sometimes paperwork gets lost in the shuffle. 
Keep copies of everything you send or receive concerning your grant pro-
gram, especially your financial and progress reports.

185
 Chapter 11: Tracking and Accounting for Federal Dollars
Closing Out a Grant
Closeout of a grant occurs when the awarding agency determines that all 
applicable administrative actions and all required programmatic work under 
the grant have been completed, with the possible exception of the final audit 
(see Chapter 12 for more on this). The closeout process completes the grant 
agreement between the awarding agency and you, the grant recipient.
Usually, you’re required to submit a final SF-269 and SF-PPR to close out the 
grant. You must submit these reports within 90 days after the expiration or 
termination date of the grant award. And yes, even if you’ve already submit-
ted a quarterly report, you still need to submit a final report with the same 
information.
After the grant period has ended, the awarding agency may allow you to keep 
property purchased with the grant. Deposition of property varies among dif-
ferent agencies. You want to talk to your federal program manager about how 
to handle any property and equipment purchased with grant money. Your 
program manager can help you follow your agency’s property disposition 
procedures.
After a grant is closed out, your awarding agency sends you a grant adjust-
ment notice indicating that your grant has expired. This notice also indicates 
whether all funding was spent or whether some of the money was returned to 
the U.S. Treasury.
You should keep all records pertaining to grant activities for three years after 
the expiration of the project. Keep the following records:
 
✓ Application
 
✓ Award documents
 
✓ Canceled checks
 
✓ Correspondence
 
✓ Deposit slips
 
✓  Financial Status Reports 
(SF-269s)
 
✓  Grant adjustment notices 
(GANs)
 ✓ Invoices
 ✓ Paid bills
 ✓  Performance Progress Reports 
(SF-PPRs)
 ✓ Receipts
 ✓ Sales slips
 ✓ Supporting documentations

Chapter 12
Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why audits are important
▶ Knowing the four types of grant audits
▶ Pulling together the necessary paperwork
▶ Following up on the grant audit findings
A
s the executive director or manager of a nonprofit, you probably 
already know that audits are a part of business. An audit doesn’t mean 
that you’re doing anything wrong. It’s simply an evaluation of what’s taken 
place. An auditor looks at events to determine the degree to which the infor-
mation presented corresponds with established guidelines. After completing 
the audit, the auditor prepares a report with the details of his findings. Audits 
are done to verify whether you’re doing what you’re supposed to do.
Although audits come in many forms, including financial (see Chapter 20 for 
more on dealing with a financial audit), the audit I’m talking about in this 
chapter takes a look at your grant documents and budgets to verify that your 
nonprofit is properly using grant money.
The grant audits I outline in this chapter not only ensure that financial state-
ments are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP), but they also analyze procurement practices, property 
management, cash management, and internal controls of grant programs.
All state, local, or tribal governments, nonprofit organizations, educational 
institutions, and hospitals that receive grant money must comply with audit-
ing rules handed down by the federal government. In this chapter, I talk 
about what you need to do to prepare for a grant audit, what the program 
manager monitors, what the program officers audit, what happens if the 
Inspector General is called, and the classifications of grant audit findings.

188
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Understanding the Purpose 
of the Grant Audit
When your nonprofit receives federal money, a grant audit determines 
whether your organization performed and complied with the federally funded 
grant. Basically Uncle Sam wants to make sure you’re following the rules and 
to ensure you’re being a good steward of federal funds.
The purpose of the grant audit is to assess and evaluate your progress. Each 
federal agency has program managers who are your primary points of con-
tact. Your program manager monitors and oversees your progress by com-
municating with you. She’ll occasionally pay you a personal visit to assess 
your progress. Before she arrives, your program manager will notify you of 
plans for an onsite visit and tell you which documents will be evaluated.
Some programs have very detailed monitoring guidelines. Whether you have 
a detailed monitoring visit is left up to the federal agency. If your program 
manager believes you’re having problems managing the grant, some correc-
tive actions will be suggested.
In addition to program managers, federal agencies have program officers who 
perform grant audits by visiting your site and doing a thorough evaluation 
of your grant files. Program officers are auditors who work for the federal 
agency that awarded you the grant.
The federal agency that gave you the grant will decide when you are audited 
or paid a visit. Just rest assured, you’ll be notified in advance of the visit and 
have plenty of time to get everything in order.
Auditing Yellow Book style
Government auditors use government audit-
ing standards (GAS) to perform governmen-
tal audits. The color of the GAS book cover 
is yellow, so it’s often called the Yellow Book. 
Grant recipients are subjected to the rules of 
the Yellow Book when they receive $500,000 or 
more of government money. The government 
is concerned not just with a nonprofit’s finan-
cial statements, but also with how it complies 
with laws and regulations. Accounting done 
by the Yellow Book is consistent with GAAS 
(generally accepted auditing standards), but 
broader in scope. For example, the Yellow 
Book has a lower threshold for misstatements 
because of government public accountability.
The major difference between the Yellow Book 
audit and GAAS is the reporting requirements. 
For example, the auditor must state in the audit 
report that the audit was done according to 
GAAS and GAS. One other difference is GAAS 
permit identifying material weaknesses, but the 
Yellow Book requires it.

189
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
To complete the audit, the program officer verifies that your nonprofit 
adheres to the following three circulars. These circulars outline the rules a 
nonprofit has to follow if it receives federal money. Chapter 10 highlights 
some of the specifics about the different rules. The following is a quick over-
view of these three circulars that the program officer uses during the audit:
 
✓ OMB Circular A-133: Different types of nonprofits have different rules 
to follow. However, all do have some of the same marching orders. The 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues audit rules to federal 
agencies in the form of OMB Circular A-133 that all nonprofits that have 
federal expenditures of $500,000 or more have to follow.
 
✓ OMB Circular A-122: OMB A-122 outlines what’s considered reasonable, 
allowable, allocable, and necessary for grant expenditures. Some costs 
are uniformly treated across the board for all organizations receiving 
grant money. For example, purchasing alcoholic beverages is not allow-
able with grant money.
 
✓ 2 CFR 215: Every nonprofit organization should have written policies and 
procedures for accounting, procurements, inventory, personnel, and travel. 
You can find the administrative requirements for nonprofit organizations in 
this circular. CFR stands for the Code of Federal Regulations, which is the 
codification of general and permanent rules and regulations (sometimes 
called administrative law) handed down by the executive branch.
Check out the “Knowing What the Auditor Looks For” section later in this 
chapter for specific areas the program officer looks at during the audit.
Who Should Undergo an Audit?
All nonprofits should undergo some type of audit. What type of audit you 
need depends on whether you receive more or less than $500,000 of grant 
money in a year.
If your nonprofit receives less than $500,000 in grants in a year, you need 
to make your records available for review or audit by the federal awarding 
agency and General Accounting Office (GAO).
If you receive $500,000 or more in a year from grants, your nonprofit should 
have a program-specific audit conducted in that same year. A program-
specific audit is conducted according to the guidelines in the general 
accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
 
For grant-related purposes, any nonprofit organization receiving at least 
$500,000 in a given year should have an independent audit of its financial 
statements, performed by a CPA (see Chapter 20 for more about these types 
of audits).

190
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
When You’re Notified: Comprehending 
the Nitty Gritty of the Audit
You’ll find out you’re due for an audit by letter. It will include details about 
the type of audit (see the next section for more on the types of grant audits) 
and who will perform it. The letter will also give you details about what you 
need to do to prepare your nonprofit. Sometimes you may have to present 
information about your grant’s progress; this can be something as simple 
as a PowerPoint presentation. You’ll have anywhere from six weeks to a few 
months to prepare for an audit.
When the time for the audit arrives, your auditor will meet with your execu-
tive director and the executive staff that manages the grant before and after 
she evaluates your grant files. During the first meeting, the auditor intro-
duces herself, talks about what will take place, and gives a general overview 
of how long the audit may take. During the closing meeting, the auditor lets 
you know that the audit is complete and the findings will be mailed after the 
report is complete. No results or findings are discussed during this closing 
meeting.
How long the audit takes depends on how much grant money you’ve re-
ceived and if you have a good grant management system that allows you 
to quickly locate the paperwork and files the auditor wants to see. Some 
audits may take only a couple of hours, while others may take up to a week 
to complete.
Identifying the Types of Grant Audits
Just like nonprofits vary in their purpose and scope, so do audits. Audits can 
range from the “What? Me worry?” audit that involves a short phone call, to 
an audit in which a representative from the Government Accounting Office 
(GAO) shows up with a fine-tooth comb to review your records. If you’ve 
broken out in a sweat thinking about that latter type of audit, you’re right to 
do so. It’s the most serious type, so you want to do everything you can to 
avoid it.
The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) states that federal 
agencies must show how the money they spend actually furthers their mis-
sion, goals, and objectives. The government measures the success of each 
grant program through quantitative outcomes measures. GPRA evaluates 
whether the grant program accomplished its objectives as stated in the proj-
ect narrative you submitted when you applied for the grant.

191
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
 
You need to know the proper way to administer and manage your grant. Make 
sure you read over the cost principles and administrative requirements (con-
tained in the OMB circulars; see Chapter 10 for more info) of your grant so 
you’re prepared for an audit. Not knowing what to do or doing the wrong thing 
sends up a red flag to the folks in D.C.
The following sections give you the lowdown on the four types of grant audits.
The relatively painless desk audit
A desk audit is the simplest kind of grant audit. Your program manager calls 
you with a series of questions about your grant. You answer the questions 
honestly, and it’s over. This audit can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, 
depending on the nature of the questions. Of course, you’re given a heads-up 
on what to expect from your program manager beforehand.
Be prepared to answer questions about your federal programs. You may get 
questions such as
 
✓ How much grant money have you spent and what is your present balance?
 
✓ Have you expended $500,000 of grant funds within the current year?
 
✓ Have you made necessary corrective action steps from the last monitor-
ing visit?
 
✓ What, if any, problems are you experiencing while implementing the 
grant project?
Based on your answers during the desk audit, your program manager may 
schedule a monitoring site visit (see the next section). Your program man-
ager wants to help you be successful in implementing your grant. To ensure 
your success, she’ll periodically visit you to check on things.
 
The desk audit is done more frequently of subgrantees by the nonprofit that 
received the grant from the federal agency. Subgrantees are the agencies that 
partnered with you to get the grant. (See Chapter 11 to understand the rela-
tionship between grantor, grantee, and subgrantees.)
Knock, knock: Knowing what to expect 
during a monitoring site visit
More than likely, your program manager skips the desk audit (see the preced-
ing section) and schedules a monitoring site visit. During this type of audit, an 
evaluation is made of all grant-supported activities to determine the progress 

192
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
you’ve made toward achieving project objectives; to verify your compliance 
with the terms, conditions, and purpose of grant; and to identify technical 
assistance needs.
 
Your monitoring site visit will be scheduled at a good time for you and your 
federal program manager. He doesn’t just show up at your door. This gives 
you ample time to make sure everything is in order. After the program man-
ager leaves, you’ll receive a corrective action plan (CAP) about how to fix any 
problems the monitor finds. (Refer to the “Following the corrective action 
plan” section later in this chapter for more info about the CAP.)
A program monitoring visit can be as casual and brief as one hour or it can 
last a couple days. The length of the visit is based on whether you’re expe-
riencing problems managing your program’s progress and/or spending the 
grant money or if you’re managing a large sum of grant money. If you’re man-
aging several million dollars with several partners, then your program man-
ager will evaluate your project and meet you and your partners in person. The 
program monitoring visit is to check on you and to offer technical assistance.
Your program manager will oversee the day-to-day operations of your grant-
supported activities, but he’s not going to get too detailed about how your 
entire management system operates. When a more complex audit is desired 
by the federal agency, you’ll get a visit from an accounting team of profes-
sionals called program officers (see the next section).
Preparing for the program officer’s 
perusal of your procedures
Your federal agency may send one person, called a program officer, or a team 
of people to audit your grant files. (Program officers are accountants who 
work for the federal agency.) Sometimes one person may show up, or a team 
of four people will come in and audit your files in one day. The complexity of 
the audit and how long it takes depend on how much money is handled.
 
As executive director of your nonprofit, you can’t do everything. The same is 
true of your program manager. She can’t be responsible for every aspect of 
your grant. Therefore, each federal agency has program officers on staff to 
audit the records of grant recipients. These program officers are professional 
auditors with a background in accounting and finance and a thorough under-
standing of the rules governing grant recipients.

193
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
When this team is scheduled to pay you a visit is left up to your program 
manager and the federal agency that awarded the grant. During this auditing 
site visit, your program officer checks out the following:
 
✓ Program compliance
 
✓ Subgrantee monitoring
The story of a compliance audit neophyte
When I started my job as a grants accountant, 
my supervisor gave me seven three-ring bind-
ers to read. The notebooks were 3 inches thick 
with more than 300 pages each. The names 
written on the outside of the notebooks were 
“Complying with Federal Grant Guidelines,” 
“Meeting Uniform Administrative Requirements,” 
“Understanding Cost Principles,” “Personnel 
Policies and Procedures,” “Financial Policies 
and Procedures,” “Managing Subgrantees,” and 
something called “Auditing.” I thought I would just 
die. For two weeks I did all I could to stay awake. I 
thought to myself, “I’m in the wrong field.”
Two weeks later my supervisor told me, “You 
have a monitoring visit by our federal program 
manager in two weeks.” That’s why he wanted 
me to read about financial, performance, and 
compliance audits. He told me I had to prepare 
the files and get ready to explain what, why, and 
how we spent more than $10 million in grant 
money.
In the back of my mind, I was thinking, “I’m 
not responsible for anything. I’ve only been 
here for one month.” When the federal pro-
gram manager showed up, we had an initia-
tion meeting to discuss what he would do for 
the next three or four days. I quickly discov-
ered an important lesson: A grantee is not just 
responsible for covering its butt, but it’s respon-
sible for monitoring its subgrantees.
The accounting staff had a very clear paper trail 
of everything pertaining to the grants, files were 
updated monthly, and everything appeared to 
be in order. Our accounting system, procure-
ment system, travel system, and personnel 
system all checked out okay.
But we failed to do one important thing: track 
the inventory of our subgrantees. I never 
thought the program manager would ask to 
visit one of our subgrantees. Then he decided to 
have a look at the equipment. Well, unknown to 
me, the equipment, which had been purchased 
a year before with the grant for $27,000, was 
still in the box. The subgrantee representative 
said the equipment hadn’t been set up because 
the software was incompatible with the current 
computer system, and the agency was keeping 
it until it could upgrade its computer system.
As grantee, I was responsible for making sure 
the subgrantees didn’t misuse or abuse grant 
money. This oversight was clearly unintentional 
by my agency and its partners, but it didn’t look 
good. We weren’t making any progress or 
accomplishing anything, other than spending 
the money.

194

✓ Financial system (internal control system)
 
✓ Procurement system (policy and procedures)
 
✓ Travel system (policy and procedures)
 
✓ Personnel system (time and attendance reports)

✓ Project performance (Government Performance and Results Act)

Make sure you tag all equipment purchased with a unit cost of $5,000 or more 
with grant money and give it an inventory control ID number that clearly indi-
cates that the equipment was purchased with grant money. Not only do you 
have to look out for yourself, but you’re responsible for any other agencies 
that partnered with you to get the grant. If you received federal money that 
you’re sharing with other agencies, follow up with your partners and make 
sure that any equipment they’ve purchased isn’t sitting in a box. For more about 
keeping tabs on equipment, see the government rules for nonprofits found at 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/2004/040511_grants.pdf.
Inspector general audit: When 
the situation is really serious
The inspector general audit is the FBI of audits. Your nonprofit gets an inspec-
tor general audit only when you’re in major trouble. “Major trouble” can 
include suspicions of fraud, waste, abuse, and misconduct. If the desk audit 
reveals some problems and the site visit indicates that you have significant 
material differences, then the Office of Inspector General investigates the 
case. This type of audit is very serious.
The Office of Inspector General falls under the U.S. Department of State. It’s 
responsible for promoting effective management and accountability in the 
federal government. The office conducts independent evaluations and audits 
that identify problems and provide solutions.
The purpose of an inspector general audit is to evaluate whether your non-
profit has spent the government’s money for its intended purposes, has accu-
rately accounted for it, and has adequate controls in place that comply with 
laws and regulations.
 
If you face an inspector general audit, you have been accused of some wrong-
doing. This accusation may have been the result of you not responding to cor-
rective actions advised by your program manager or program officers, or a 
concerned citizen may have reported you. If an investigation reveals the accu-
sations to be true, you’ll probably have to pay the money back, and you may 
be hit with heavy penalties and ordered to serve jail time.

 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
Knowing What the Auditor Looks For
If you’ve ever put your house on the market, you know how people come in 
and look in closets, open up cabinets, pull out drawers, and see what’s what 
(which you may not be very comfortable with). Well, your auditor will look 
through everything to make sure your nonprofit is following the rules. The 
auditor performs three general tasks:
 
✓ Look for improper payments: All grants have rules about how to allo-
cate expenses, what you can buy, and what you shouldn’t buy. These 
are called cost principles. Your auditor will look for improper payments 
and determine whether costs were allowable according to cost principles.
 
✓ Look at internal controls: To ensure your organization has taken steps 
to protect its assets, the grant auditor determines whether you’ve estab-
lished internal controls, or checks and balances. You have to follow the 
rules about administering the grant program. The auditor checks your 
use of internal controls to make sure you’re following the rules.
 
✓ Assess the risk factor: Based on your purchasing, accounting, and inven-
tory systems, your auditor will assess the risk for problems. It doesn’t 
take a rocket scientist to detect trouble, especially if your accounting 
system is inadequate and you’re not keeping up with things.
For your organization to have a successful audit, you need to make sure the 
program manager can access everything. The following sections explain the 
importance of getting your books in order, preparing other important docu-
mentation, and presenting the grant expenses that you’ve kept track of so 
your audit can go off without a hitch.
Universities pay back millions
For years universities operated on the honor 
system because the federal government trusted 
institutions of higher education to do the right 
thing. But then the government decided to 
examine how these institutions were spending 
their federal dollars. From about 2003 to 2005, 
the following universities paid millions to settle 
abuse of and misconduct in regard to govern-
ment grant money: Mayo Clinic paid $6.5 million, 
Northwestern paid $5.5 million, the University of 
Alabama paid $3.4 million, Johns Hopkins paid 
$2.6 million, and Harvard paid $2.4 million.
I’ve worked with universities that slip a few 
things through the cracks. One area in which 
they tend to deviate from the rules is when 
hiring consultants at expensive, unreasonable 
rates for work that is paid for out of grant money, 
but the work is never done. I’ve witnessed some 
behavior that I refused to put my signature on 
for approval.
Now that the Office of Inspector General is 
investigating universities, we can expect to see 
more cases of mismanaged government funds.

Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
 
In real estate, agents determine the odds of selling your home by three things: 
location, location, location. In the world of grants, successfully passing an 
audit also depends on three important things: documentation, documentation, 
documentation.
Preparing the books for audit review
In order for your program manager to monitor your grant’s progress, you 
need to make sure your records are accessible. Get all of your records in 
order so when the program manager comes knocking, he has everything 
he needs at his fingertips. He’ll tell you what will be examined. Of course, 
one thing can lead to another, so I suggest that you only give him what he 
asks for.
 
Be sure to make and keep copies of everything pertaining to the grant, includ-
ing financial and progress reports (see Chapter 11), to make the program 
manager’s job easier. Keeping good records is important because you want 
the audit to move like clockwork. If your program manager has a difficult time 
making sense of your documentation, you may prolong the audit process.
For every grant you receive, you should keep the following in a hard-copy file:
 
✓ Copy of the grant application
 
✓ Copy of all letters and correspondence (including e-mails)
 
✓ Copy of the grant award document
 
✓ Copy of the grant budget
 
✓ Copy of all grant adjustment notices (including subgrantees)
 
✓ Copy of all receipts, invoices, bills, canceled checks, and so on
 
✓ Copy of the grant employees’ payroll information
 
✓ Copy of time and attendance reports
Your program manager will look at these records to make sure you’re in com-
pliance with the intended purposes for the grant award.
 
If you have well-organized and adequate records of all grant activities, you’re 
sure to breeze through the grant audit process. The only thing an audit does 
is verify that you’ve followed the grant guidelines. It’s virtually impossible to 
verify what you’ve done without documentation.
 
Before you destroy any grant files, contact your program manager. All records 
of grant activities should be kept on file for three years after the close-out of 
the grant period, unless an investigation is under way. If you’re under investi-
gation, you’ll need to keep the records until after the investigation is over.

197
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
Proving your agency’s existence with 
organizational records and documents
You know your nonprofit exists; I trust that your nonprofit exists. But Uncle 
Sam wants unquestionable proof that your nonprofit is what you say it is. 
Your program officer will want to see records that verify how and when your 
organization was structured. In addition, the officer will ask for documents 
about your financial structure, personnel policies, and procedures. Make 
sure you have the following papers readily available:
 
✓ IRS letter of determination: Your IRS letter of determination is the letter 
you received when you established your nonprofit. It indicates that your 
organization is exempt from federal corporate income taxes. It contains 
important information regarding the basis for your exemption and the 
requirements associated with maintaining it.
 
✓ Articles of incorporation and organizational bylaws: The articles of 
incorporation and bylaws are documents you set up when you started 
your organization. If you’ve made any amendments to your bylaws, 
make sure to attach those to your original bylaws.
 
✓ Names and addresses of board members: An up-to-date list of your current 
board members may be needed for an evaluation of members’ political affil-
iations. (Remember, there’s not supposed to be any undue influence made 
by anyone to get grant money.) It’s best to have information about the 
other boards your members sit on and where your members are employed 
available just in case you’re asked for it. Contact information, including 
e-mail addresses and telephone numbers, for board members may be 
required. The best solution is to have resumes of all board members on file.
 
✓ Organization operating budget: Your program officer probably will want to 
see your operating budget for the current or upcoming program year. This 
organizational budget differs from the grant project budget. It allows the audi-
tor to put the grant money in a larger context and see the big picture. He can 
use this budget to determine how much you’re relying on grant funding to 
run your programs. (See Chapter 8 for more on operating budgets.)
 
✓ Indirect cost rate: The auditor will need a copy of your organization’s 
indirect cost rate (if you have one) to verify that the correct percent-
ages have been allocated to the grant. (Your indirect cost rate assigns a 
percentage of your general overhead and administrative expenses to the 
grant. See Chapter 18 for more info about this.)
 
✓ Financial statements: Your program officer will want to review your 
financial statements and Form 990s to determine whether you’re finan-
cially stable. If you’re over your head in debt, your organization may 
not be the best investment of grant dollars. On the other hand, if you’re 
stable financially, it proves that the government made a good choice in 
selecting you to receive grant money. Check out the chapters in Part IV 
for how to create these statements.

198
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
 
Having all of these documents and information at your fingertips when the 
auditor arrives saves time, and it shows that you’re organized and a good 
record-keeper.
Tracking all grant expenses
The federal government has given your organization money, and it expects 
you to use it properly. To prove that you spent the money in accordance 
with the government’s expectations, you need to track all expenses back to 
the invoice and to the request for bid if more than $25,000. For every federal 
dollar you spend, you should keep the receipt and anything else pertaining to 
the purchase. When your program manager shows up at your office, he’s not 
just going to take your word that you paid certain amounts for certain items 
out of your grant budget. You have to have documentation to support every 
transaction.
A request for bid advertises that you need professional services or plan to 
purchase something from an outside vendor. Be careful with requests for bids 
because your program manager will want to verify that it was handled correctly.
Your program manager should be able to take a charge allocated to grant 
funds and track it back to the request for bid. Copies of checks written and 
rebate checks should correspond to purchases. Your manager will want to 
see how you account for grant expenditures and how you keep them sepa-
rate by account numbers from your regular normal nonprofit expenses. (See 
Chapter 11 for more on keeping grant expenses separate from other expenses.)
You need to pay particular attention to employee salaries paid from grant 
money. Your accounting system should have accounting codes that separate 
and allocate grant employees’ pay to a designated grant account. You may 
want to set up a spreadsheet that shows that you keep up with employees 
paid from the grant. (See Chapter 4 for information about using spreadsheets.)
 
Time and attendance reports should be recorded and kept on file for every 
employee paid from the grant. These reports should be signed by the employ-
ee’s immediate supervisor. One of the most common audit findings is the lack of 
time and attendance reports. (See Chapter 18 for more about these reports.)
Auditing Cash Management
During the audit, the program manager checks your nonprofit’s cash manage-
ment. In fact, having excess cash on hand is a common audit finding. A good 
system of cash management helps determine how much cash is needed to 
take care of immediate needs.

199
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
As a director or manager of a small- to medium-sized nonprofit, you need to have 
a system of cash management because having excess cash in your bank account 
is a sign of poor cash management. This section helps you reduce the amount of 
cash on hand and discusses the importance of protecting the money in-house.
Minimizing cash on hand
The key to drawing down federal grant dollars from the U.S. Treasury is to 
not have more money in your checking account than you need (see Chapter 
11 for more on drawing down grant money). Your auditor will review all 
drawdowns to determine whether you’re properly managing federal dollars 
by keeping the money on hand for a minimum amount of time.
Most people don’t have excess cash in their personal checking accounts. The 
same should go for your nonprofit and its grant money. Your grant money 
should not lie in your bank account long enough to draw substantial amounts 
of interest. The main reason: The federal government is giving you this grant 
money to use on your programs and services, not to sit in your checking 
account. The money requested from the U.S. Treasury should pass through 
your checking account quickly.
You need to remember two things about having cash on hand:
 
✓ Up to $100 per year may be kept for administrative expenses. 
Administrative expenses are the costs to oversee the administration of a 
project, such as the time spent processing payments. As with all things 
grant-related, verify this with your program manager.
 
✓ Interest earned on federal fund balances in excess of $250 is required 
to be returned to the federal agency. If you earn interest, you should 
report it to your program manager and make her aware of why it hap-
pened. You’re not supposed to hold the money in your bank account for 
extended periods of time during which it can collect interest.
 
You’re not supposed to use the grant money for anything other than to support 
the program for which the money is intended. So you can’t borrow money from 
the grant funds to pay for things and then put it back. It’s not excess cash.
Segregating duties through 
internal controls
Internal controls provide reasonable assurance that the spending of grant 
money complies with laws and regulations. In layman’s terms, this would be 
called a system of checks and balances. As the director or manager, you need 

200
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
to make sure your nonprofit has internal controls in place to protect the 
organization’s finances and assets.
Your auditor will review your entire management system and look at the 
internal controls you’ve established. No audit is complete without checking 
for protective measures that safeguard you from possible theft or embezzle-
ment. Your accounting, procurement, personnel, property, and travel systems 
are all interrelated, so your auditor will check the adequacies of these areas.
 
I suggest you implement the following internal controls in your organization 
to protect not only the grant money you receive, but all donations and assets 
you have:
 
✓ Have your in-house project manager (not to be confused with the pro-
gram manager from the federal agency that issued your grant) be the 
person who authorizes payments and charges against the grant budget.
 
✓ Segregate duties within your organization. The person who writes 
checks shouldn’t be the same person who balances the books. 
Furthermore, the person counting the money shouldn’t make deposits, 
approve payments, and request money from the federal government. 
This is why some companies have separate accounts receivables and 
accounts payables departments. Separating duties safeguards your 
money.
 
✓ Require two signatures on all checks over a certain amount. You can 
also have your bank call you for checks over a set amount. Decisions 
about these amounts depend on your accounting activities and size of 
your overall budget. For example, if your organization seldom writes 
a check for more than $500, you may want to place restrictions on all 
checks written above this amount. Discuss this with your board if you’re 
not sure about what amount to use.
 
✓ Have internal auditors on staff. You save time and money when people 
inside your organization make sure that you’re properly accounting for 
expenditures and check to see that you’re in compliance.
 
Keeping a close watch on your money can protect you from theft or embezzle-
ment. A weak internal control system opens up the possibility that your non-
profit will be stolen from.
 
Make sure you don’t supplant any grant money. To supplant grant money 
means to use grant money for something that’s already in your budget. Grant 
funds should be used to supplement — not supplant. For example, if you 
receive a donation to hire a new secretary but you use grant money to pay the 
secretary’s salary, you’ve supplanted grant funds. If you’re unsure about how 
to allocate expenses to your grant, ask your program manager about training 
opportunities offered by the federal agency.

201
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
Receiving the Report of Audit Findings
When the auditor is finished with the audit, she issues an audit report, which 
tells your organization the results of the audit. The audit report is the final 
stage of the audit process, and it communicates audit findings. Audit findings 
are what the auditor discovers after careful evaluation and comparison of 
your grant activities to the rules, standards, and circulars. When you get your 
audit findings depends on how long it takes the auditor to prepare it. As with 
all things government-related, it can take a while.
Auditors are required to report any questionable costs totaling $10,000 or 
more for known or likely noncompliance issues. The report includes the 
method used to calculate the questionable costs and the facts supporting the 
identified deficiency. Government threshold and tolerance for audit findings 
are stringent. If the program officer discovers anything that indicates you 
haven’t handled the grant money according to the guidelines, you’ll be made 
to pay back the funds.
The following sections give you the lowdown on how audit findings are classi-
fied and how to take corrective action to ensure your nonprofit gets back on 
your program manager and program officer’s good side.
With no internal controls, you have no control
I got a call about a year ago from a desperate 
woman who owned a boating company and was 
in crisis mode. She had trusted her accountant 
to take care of all of her business’s bookkeeping 
and accounting, no questions asked. Well, the 
accountant owned a check-cashing business and 
had no problems writing and cashing checks. The 
accountant had stolen more than $80,000.
By the time the woman discovered what her 
accountant had done, it was too late to do 
anything about it. The accountant was the only 
person balancing the books, writing the checks, 
approving payments, and using his check-cash-
ing company to cash them. No one had estab-
lished any internal controls for the woman’s 
business.
The woman wanted to know if I could write a 
grant to get her stolen money back because she 
believed (incorrectly) that grant money could be 
used for anything.
I had to explain to her how grant money is used 
to fill a gap in society and that for-profit busi-
nesses like hers seldom qualify for grant money. 
I helped her understand how grant money is 
used in communities to provide jobs; to assist 
the elderly, needy families, and at-risk children; 
or to deter criminal behavior.
In the end I told the caller to apply for a Small 
Business Administration (SBA) loan. She 
thanked me, and we hung up.

202
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Classifying the audit finding
Anytime something is wrong in a court of law, juries, judges, and prosecutors 
consider the intent behind the misconduct. This is true with audit findings as 
well. If your auditor finds something wrong with your federal grant records, 
she will specify how the mistake came to be. Consider the following:
 
✓ Error: This is when you unintentionally fail to comply with laws, regula-
tions, or terms and conditions of a grant agreement, or you unintention-
ally omit amounts or disclosures in financial statements.
 
✓ Irregularity: An irregularity is an intentional misstatement or omission 
on a financial statement.
 
✓ Illegal act: This is an outright violation of law or regulations. Whether an 
act is illegal may have to await a final decision by a court of law.
 
✓ Improper conduct: An agency employee, contractor, supplier, or recipi-
ent is said to have exhibited improper conduct when he performs his 
duties in a manner that contributes to the abuse or waste of grant 
money, but that isn’t a criminal violation.
 
✓ Abuse: Abuse is defined as conducting a government program in a manner 
that doesn’t meet the public’s expectations for prudent behavior, but 
which doesn’t violate any law, regulation, agreement, or contract.
 
✓ Fraud: You’ve committed fraud if you’re found guilty of an illegal act that 
involves obtaining something of value through willful misrepresentation.
 
✓ Waste: This is when you overspend for items that can be purchased 
for less.
 
✓ Noncompliance: Your agency is found to be in noncompliance when you 
deviate from the laws and regulations governing the administration of 
grant funds.
These classifications are listed in your audit report according to the dollar 
value of the findings.
Late-night infomercials have done severe damage to the perception of federal 
grants. Many people have been misinformed, and the general public believes 
that you can get a grant to do anything. There are consequences for every 
choice you make when managing your grant.
Following the corrective action plan
After your program manager leaves, you’ll receive a written report of prob-
lems to fix. You’ll have to respond with the steps you’ll take to correct prob-
lems. These steps are called your corrective action plan (CAP).

203
 Chapter 12: Getting Ready for the Grant Audit
Some common findings included on a corrective action plan are the need to 
monitor subgrantees and to establish segregation of duties. As a grant recipi-
ent, you need to take the actions specified in the corrective action plan. If 
you need help, contact your program manager for suggestions or technical 
support. Your program manager will ask for a report from you that explains 
how the corrective measures are being implemented.
 
It’s in your best interest to respond promptly to the corrective action plan. 
The consequences of not responding can be detrimental to your current fund-
ing and all future funding. If you fail to follow your corrective action plan, 
you’re not cooperating with the terms of the grant agreement, and this makes 
it difficult for all parties involved.

Accounting for Payroll 
and Payroll Taxes
In This Chapter
▶ Creating payroll accounts for employees
▶ Calculating federal, state, and local taxes
▶ Paying quarterly payroll taxes
▶ Submitting IRS payroll requirements
▶ Reporting info about contract employees
You’re the executive director or manager at a small- to medium-sized 
nonprofit, so you may assume that because of your organization’s 
nonprofit status, you don’t have to pay any taxes. After all, your status does 
mean your organization owes no corporate income taxes. However, you’re 
still responsible for paying federal payroll taxes for your employees.
The good news is that you can account for payroll and payroll taxes for non-
profit employees similarly to how other for-profit organizations do so. As an 
employer, you’re required to withhold and/or pay state and federal payroll 
taxes on behalf of your employees.
You can easily set up your organization’s payroll accounting yourself. Or if 
you prefer, you can hire some part-time help or buy prepackaged software 
for nonprofits. Regardless of the method you choose, you’re responsible for 
accounting for payroll, taking out the right amount of taxes, and submitting 
taxes with the required paperwork on time.
Not to worry, though. This chapter shows you how to account for your 
payroll taxes and all other deductions for the federal, state, and local gov-
ernments. After reading this chapter, you’ll know how to file the necessary 
paperwork, where to send forms, and when to file forms so you stay current 
with your paperwork — not to mention keep your nonprofit status.

206
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
 
As an employer, you need to concern yourself with establishing and paying 
a fair rate of pay and submitting payroll tax payments on time. Some issues, 
such as minimum wage, have already been decided for you.
Setting Up Payroll Accounts 
for Nonprofit Employees
Before you can pay federal and state payroll taxes for your employees, you 
need to make sure you have the proper records and documentation. To do 
so, establish payroll accounts for your employees by creating a file for each 
employee. These files can be either electronic or hard copies, depending on 
your preference. If you use computer software to set up your payroll, your 
computer walks you through this process. Only your personnel clerk, book-
keeper, accountant, supervisor, and executive director should have access to 
payroll files. You should keep these files under lock and key because of the 
private information they contain.
Federal law requires all employers to keep records of total wages and hours 
worked by employees, but it doesn’t specify how to keep these records. A 
great place to keep track of hours and wages is in your employee personnel 
files, which you can create on an employee’s first day. Set up a file for each 
employee with the following information:
 
✓ Employee’s name, Social Security number, home address, job title, 
gender, and birth date
 
✓ Workweek hours and dates
 
✓ Total hours worked each workday
 
✓ Total daily or weekly regular time earnings
 
✓ Regular hourly pay rate
 
✓ Total overtime pay for the workweek
 
✓ Deductions from wages
 
✓ Additions to wages
 
✓ Pay date and pay period
Make sure you include Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance 
Certificate, in the paperwork you give your new employees to fill out on their 
first day of work. Form W-4 indicates filing status, exemptions, and any extra 
taxes to be taken out of an employee’s salary. The purpose of Form W-4 is to 
tell you how much federal income tax to withhold from your employee’s pay-
check. Figure 13-1 shows an example of Form W-4.

Keeping employee time sheets can help you justify why you paid what to whom to 
assure both the government and your employees that you’re adhering to federal 
employer-employee guidelines. The Department of Labor oversees these federal 
guidelines concerning employer and employee relationships. The Department of 
Labor enforces laws established by the Federal Standards Labor Act, which 
ensures that employees receive fair wages and overtime pay. The act also 
requires employers to allocate and pay payroll deductions in a timely manner.
Deducting the Right Amount of Taxes
Before you start calculating how much to deduct from your employees’ pay-
checks for payroll taxes, you need to know how much to deduct for federal 
and state income taxes. Don’t worry. You don’t have to be a math whiz to do 
so. The IRS and state governments offer you tax tables to tell you how much 
to deduct for federal and state taxes.
You calculate the amount of federal income tax to withhold from each 
employee based on a federal income tax table, which takes into account the 
information your employees put on the Form W-4 they fill out on their first 
day of work. This information includes how many dependents they want to 
claim, what their filing status is (single, married, and so on), and if they want 
extra money taken out of their checks.
 
Don’t forget to get the current tax tables for the year in which you’re filing. 
The laws change constantly, so the tables that you used last year aren’t valid 
this year. To find out where you can get copies of these tax tables and all 
other tax forms, see Figure 13-2 for federal information. Contact your state 
department of revenue for state information.

When figuring out how much to pay in federal payroll taxes for each 
employee, salary is by far the most important factor to consider. However, 
it’s not the only one. This section highlights the areas you need to consider 
when determining how much to pay in federal payroll taxes.
Salaries and wages
Before you determine how much to pay in federal payroll taxes for your 
employees, you need to know the IRS’s two main classifications of employ-
ees. These classifications significantly impact when and how much you pay 
in taxes. The two types of employees are
 
✓ Exempt: These employees are paid a set salary and don’t qualify for 
overtime pay.
 
✓ Nonexempt: These employees are paid an hourly rate and do qualify for 
overtime pay.
 
 According to federal law, nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum 
wage of at least $6.55 per hour (effective July 24, 2008). Beginning July 
24, 2009, the per hour minimum wage rate is $7.25.

209
 Chapter 13: Accounting for Payroll and Payroll Taxes
 
Minimum wage laws are preset by the federal government, but most states 
also have minimum wage laws. An employer can never pay an employee less 
than the minimum wage set by the federal government.
You figure out how much you need to pay in payroll taxes by multiplying 
the salary amount by the federal payroll tax rates, which are established 
by law. You can find payroll tax rules, rates, withholding tables, and report-
ing instructions in IRS Publication 15, Employer’s Tax Guide, also known as 
Circular E. You can find Publication 15 and any other IRS publication at www.
irs.gov/app/picklist/list/publicationsNoticesPdf.html.
Overtime and cash advances
When calculating how much tax to deduct from your employees’ paychecks, 
you need to consider two important areas other than salary: overtime and 
cash advances. Overtime is the amount of time an employee works beyond 
normal working hours. According to federal law, employers must pay work-
ers overtime pay at a rate of at least one and a half times their regular pay 
rate when the workers work more than 40 hours in a given workweek.
For example, if an employee works 48 hours in a workweek and is paid 
$15.00 per hour, the employee is entitled to $22.50 per hour for each hour 
of overtime ($15.00 × 1.5). The employee’s regular pay for 40 hours is $600. 
For 8 hours of overtime, the pay rate is $22.50 × 8, which equals $180. This 
employee is entitled to $600 plus $180 for a total of $780.
 
For questions about overtime pay, call the Wage and Hour Division of the 
Department of Labor at 866-4-US-WAGE (866-487-9243).
An automatic way to give and receive
Some donors give organizations contributions 
via authorized payroll deductions, which are 
deductions right from their paychecks. They’re 
like money in your bank account because you 
receive the money in a systematic way around 
the same time after each pay period. Donors 
choose which paychecks you receive dona-
tions from. For instance, some donors allow you 
to take deductions out of their second checks if 
they’re paid twice a month.
Larger nonprofits have been using authorized 
payroll deductions for years. For example, 
United Way takes authorized payroll deductions 
right out of its donor’s payroll checks. Doing so 
works well for both the person giving and the 
organization receiving because it spreads the 
donations out over longer periods of time for 
the donor and gives the recipient, United Way 
in this example, a solid projection of expected 
revenues.

210
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
In addition to overtime, cash advances are an important factor in determin-
ing tax deductions. Cash advances are loans that the employer gives to an 
employee that will be repaid from the employee’s future pay. Giving cash 
advances to your nonprofit employees is a subject for board discussion 
and approval. Use your own discretion when loaning or giving employees 
advances on their pay. If you have the money in your personal account, 
you can decide whether to give an advance from your own account, not the 
nonprofit’s. But, I suggest that you not use your organization’s income for 
employees’ personal use.
However, if you do decide to give cash advances, don’t confuse advances 
and wages. Advances aren’t taxed; they’re loans. The employee’s wages are 
taxed. The employer withholds the amount advanced to an employee from 
the employee’s paycheck as repayment of the advance. Before you decide to 
give cash advances, be sure to check with your board of directors.
Calculating Specific FICA Payroll 
Taxes and Deductions
Before you start calculating payroll taxes and posting them in the books, you 
need to know the details about each employee’s withholding allowances or 
exemptions. After you’ve pulled this information from each employee’s Form 
W-4, you need to compute each employee’s gross pay for the pay period. 
After doing so, you’re ready to calculate payroll taxes and deductions.
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is a federal payroll tax that 
both employees and employers have to pay. The funds collected from FICA 
Don’t worry about these benefits with the IRS
Lucky for you, you don’t have to be overly con-
cerned with certain payroll benefits from a fed-
eral standpoint. Federal laws do not regulate 
the following:
 ✓ Paid sick and vacation leave
 ✓ Holiday pay
 ✓ Pay raises
 ✓ Immediate payment of final wages to termi-
nated employees
However, check with your CPA, because you 
may need to familiarize yourself with state laws 
that do affect these benefits.
Furthermore, the IRS isn’t concerned with 
whether employers pay fringe benefits to 
employees; fringe benefits include day-care 
services, company cars, bonuses, expense 
accounts, medical insurance, or retirement 
benefits. According to federal laws, you don’t 
have to pay fringe benefits to your employees.

211
 Chapter 13: Accounting for Payroll and Payroll Taxes
are used to fund Social Security and Medicare retirement benefits and to pro-
vide for disabled workers and children of deceased workers.
Employees pay 7.65 percent of their gross income for FICA, and their 
employer matches by also paying 7.65 percent. Self-employed people pay the 
total 15.3 percent (the employer’s 7.65 percent plus the employee’s 7.65 per-
cent) of total gross income for FICA. The total FICA rate for employers in 2009 
was 7.65 percent of gross salary up to $102,000.
So, for example, if you have an employee who makes $500 a week, you — as 
the employer — have to pay $38.25 (7.65 × $500) for FICA taxes. Your employee 
has to pay the same $38.25 to match yours. If you’re self-employed and make 
$500 a week, you owe the total $76.50 ($38.25 plus $38.25) in FICA taxes.
The IRS calculates FICA taxes at the same rate on regular pay, overtime pay, 
and bonus pay. When you have to pay payroll taxes to the IRS depends on 
whether your organization is just starting out or you’ve been operating for a 
few years. For example, as a rule of thumb, the IRS requires all new nonprof-
its to pay payroll taxes on a monthly basis for the first year. After your first 
year, the IRS tells you how often you need to pay payroll taxes — weekly, biweekly, 
monthly, quarterly, or annually. The determining factor is how much money you 
owe in a given week, month, or quarter. For example, if you owe $2,500 or less, 
the IRS will probably have you pay on a quarterly basis. Most organizations pay 
payroll taxes quarterly. See the “Paying Quarterly Payroll Taxes with Form 941 and 
Form 8109” section for more on making payments on a quarterly basis.
By law, religious groups have the option to oppose paying Social Security taxes. 
If you make more than $100 per year and you work for a religious organization 
that doesn’t participate in paying Social Security and Medicare taxes (FICA), 
you’re considered self-employed, which means you have to pay the IRS 15.3 per-
cent of your gross income for Social Security and Medicare. If you’re in this situ-
ation and you make $500 a week, you owe the total $76.50 ($38.25 plus $38.25) in 
FICA taxes. Remember that the 15.3 percent that you pay is the combination of 
your employer’s 7.65 percent and your 7.65 percent as the employee.
 
If you’re a lower-level manager at your nonprofit and the nonprofit doesn’t 
take taxes out of your paycheck, you may think you’ve hit the jackpot. But 
eventually you have to render to Caesar that which is Caesar’s, or the United 
States government in this case. The best approach is to save and pay your 
taxes monthly or quarterly to relieve some of the burden of waiting until the 
end of the year. The IRS charges heftier penalties and much higher interest 
rates than credit card companies, so saving and paying are good ideas.
 
As for paying taxes on federal unemployment benefits, I have some good 
news. You don’t have to worry about paying taxes on them if your organiza-
tion holds an IRC Section 501(c)(3) exemption status under IRC Section 501. 
To verify your exemption, take a look at your letter of determination from the 
IRS to find out how the IRS classified your nonprofit status and under which 
code it established your nonprofit status.

212
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Paying Quarterly Payroll Taxes 
with Form 941 and Form 8109
Quarterly payroll taxes are taxes that your nonprofit owes to the IRS for your 
match portion of FICA and the amount you withheld from your employees 
for their portion of FICA and for federal income taxes. As an employer, you’re 
responsible for matching your portion of the FICA tax (7.65 percent of wages). 
Making your payments to the federal government on time is very important.
You use Form 941, employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, to report your 
quarterly wages and payroll taxes to the IRS, and then depending on the type 
of depositor you are, you either use Form 941 or Form 8109 to make your 
payments. See the “Completing Form 8109 (Making tax deposits)” section for 
more about this form.
Form 941 includes the following information:
 
✓ Wages you’ve paid
 
✓ Tips your employees received
 
✓ Federal income taxes you withheld
 
✓ Employer’s and employee’s shares of Social Security and Medicare taxes
 
✓ Advance earned income tax credit (EIC) payments
 
✓ Adjustments for prior quarterly payroll taxes
Churches don’t have to pay
Churches and religious organizations are 
exempt from paying income taxes and filing Form 
990. They’re protected by the First Amendment 
of the Constitution. Unlike other chief executive 
officers, churches are not required to withhold 
income tax from their ordained, commissioned, 
or licensed ministers for performing services in 
the exercise of their ministry.
In addition, a minister who’s furnished a par-
sonage or housing allowance doesn’t have to 
report it as part of his gross income. A minister 
can choose to voluntarily pay income tax if he 
wants to, but he doesn’t have to.
The only time a church can be investigated 
by the IRS is when someone files a written 
complaint. If you need more information about 
churches and religious organizations, call 800-
829-3676 and ask for the IRS Tax Guide for 
Churches and Religious Organizations, or find 
a copy at www.irs.gov.

213
 Chapter 13: Accounting for Payroll and Payroll Taxes
I can’t stress enough how important paying these quarterly taxes is. If you 
fall behind, catching up can be extremely difficult. If you do fall behind on 
payroll taxes, talk with your tax accountant for clarity on what steps to take. 
You may want to go to your local bank and borrow the money. The penalties 
and interest on IRS outstanding debts is higher than any credit card on the 
market.
The following sections walk you through Form 941 and Form 8109 and helps 
you complete them. I also explain how to file the forms and where to send 
them and your payment.
 
Create a file with copies of all the forms, checks, and everything else you send 
to the IRS. Sometimes the IRS makes mistakes. Plus, you need to keep up with 
what you’ve paid.
Completing Form 941
As an employer, you withhold federal taxes from your employees for the 
federal government. Form 941 (see Figure 13-3) is your explanation to the IRS 
of how much you’ve deducted from your employees’ paychecks and held for 
the federal government in federal income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare 
taxes.
According to the IRS, preparing, copying, assembling, and sending Form 941 
takes just two hours of your time every three months. You can find a copy of 
Form 941 online at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f941.pdf.
 
To save time, you can save a copy of the online form on your computer so that 
each quarter you need to fill in only the information that has changed since 
the last quarter.
Complete the following simple steps to correctly fill out Form 941:
 
1. Fill in the top portion of the form.
 
 Fill in your EIN (employer identification number), the name of your orga-
nization, your business address, and the reporting quarter.
 
2. Complete Part 1.
 
 Part 1 is the meat of the form. Answer the questions about how many 
employees you have, how much they’ve earned, and how much federal 
income tax you’ve withheld. If working through this part by yourself doesn’t 
work for you, consider contracting out your payroll services to a book-
keeper or accountant. You can even bite the bullet and hire a CPA — if 
you can afford it.

3. Complete Part 2.
 
 Part 2 determines your tax liability for the quarter. If you’re a small 
nonprofit, you probably owe less than $2,500; if you do, you can check 
the first box next to number 15 and go on to Part 3. (You can pay your 
payroll taxes when you submit Form 941.) If you owe more than $2,500, 
fill out the rest of this part. If you need help, you may want to hire an 
accountant.

Filing Form 941
After you complete Form 941, you need to file it with the IRS, and if you 
haven’t made tax deposits or still have a balance due, you need to make a tax 
payment with the 941. Because Form 941 is only a report, you need to submit 
a payment voucher — Form 941-V — if you’re submitting a payment with 
your quarterly report.
If you’re a new nonprofit with no previous tax payment history, the IRS 
requires you to pay monthly using Form 8109, Federal Tax Deposit (FTD). 
Monthly deposits are due by the 15th of the following month. For example, 
you have to deposit taxes from paydays during December by January 15. (See 
the “Completing Form 8109 (Making tax deposits)” section for more on Form 
8109.) After you’ve established a payment history with the IRS, it can deter-
mine or project what your future payments are likely to be. The IRS then tells 
you in February how and when you need to file and which method you need 
to use to make your payments. If the IRS determines based on your monthly 
payments that you should pay more frequently than quarterly, it will tell you 
when and how to pay.
If your nonprofit owes less than $2,500 in payroll taxes and isn’t new, you can 
pay your payroll taxes quarterly with a timely filed Form 941 and enclosing 
your check and payment voucher 941-V. If you owe more than $2,500, how-
ever, you need to contact the IRS (or the IRS will contact you after it receives 
your Form 941) to find out how often you need to pay your payroll taxes. 
Larger nonprofits pay payroll taxes either weekly, semi-weekly, or monthly 

216
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
by making payroll tax deposits. Most small nonprofits pay quarterly payroll 
taxes, and even smaller ones pay annually. Those nonprofits that pay annu-
ally use an annual payroll tax report called Form 944. Annual Form 944 is due 
by January 31. Refer to Table 13-1 to find out when your quarterly FICA pay-
roll taxes are due.

Don’t send a payment with Form 941 unless you’re on a quarterly payment 
schedule. If you owe more than $2,500 and wait to pay it when you file your 
Form 941 at the end of the quarterly reporting period, you’ll have made a late 
payment and may have to pay a penalty. See the section “Completing Form 
8109 (Making tax deposits)” for information on how to pay your payroll taxes.
 
The IRS tax line is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST to 
order tax deposit forms and to answer your questions. That number is 800-
829-4933. You can also visit www.irs.gov to download copies of Form 941, 
the quarterly report, and Form 944, the annual report.
When paying your payroll taxes with Form 941, write a check or money order 
payable to the “United States Treasury.” Where you send your payment and 
Form 941 depends on where you live. Large nonprofits make their payments 
electronically using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). 
Small nonprofits can choose to make tax payments electronically or at a bank 
using Form 8109. Even smaller nonprofits can make payments by mail using 
Form 941-V. If you’re paying by mail, see Figure 13-4 for where you can send 
your Form 941.
Completing Form 8109 
 (Making tax deposits)
The IRS has made paying your payroll taxes a fairly easy task. When you reg-
ister with the IRS and indicate you’ll need to report payroll, you’ll be enrolled 
in the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). You’ll be sent informa-
tion on how to activate your enrollment. You’ll also be able to get a booklet of 
preprinted Federal Tax Deposit Coupons (Form 8109) by calling 800-829-4933. 
These coupons allow you to make deposits either electronically or at a bank.

You can use Form 8109 (refer to Figure 13-5) to make your payroll tax pay-
ments called Federal Tax Deposits (FTDs) at a financial institution. When you 
make your tax payment using Form 8109, record the amount of tax, the type 
of tax (Form 941), and the quarter you’re paying for on a coupon, and then 
present that coupon with your payment to a bank that’s authorized to accept 
FTDs. The bank will give you a receipt. You report your deposits on Form 941.
To pay electronically, go to www.eftps.gov and follow the steps on the 
screens. Remember to record your electronic payment in your checkbook 
register.
The IRS imposes a deposit requirement on some organizations. But smaller 
organizations typically can choose whether they want to mail Form 941 with 
a 941-V payment voucher attached to their payment, use Form 8109 to make 
a deposit at a bank, or pay electronically.
Most banks are authorized to collect this coupon along with your payment 
and make the deposit to the IRS. Ask your local bank if it’s authorized to 
make the transaction for you.

Note. Except for the name, address, and telephone number, entries must
be made in pencil. Use soft lead (for example, a #2 pencil) so that the
entries can be read more accurately by optical scanning equipment. The
name, address, and telephone number may be completed other than by
hand. You cannot use photocopies of the coupons to make your
deposits. Do not staple, tape, or fold the coupons.
Purpose of form. Use Form 8109-B to make a tax deposit only in the
following two situations.
1. You have not yet received your resupply of preprinted deposit
coupons (Form 8109).
2. You are a new entity and have already been assigned an employer
identification number (EIN), but you have not received your initial supply
of preprinted deposit coupons (Form 8109). If you have not received your
EIN, see Exceptions below.
Note. If you do not receive your resupply of deposit coupons and a
deposit is due or you do not receive your initial supply within 5–6 weeks
of receipt of your EIN, call 1-800-829-4933.
Exceptions. If you have applied for an EIN, have not received it, and
a deposit must be made, do not use Form 8109-B. Instead, send your
payment to the IRS address where you file your return. Make your check
or money order payable to the United States Treasury and show on it
your name (as shown on Form SS-4, Application for Employer
Identification Number), address, kind of tax, period covered, and date
you applied for an EIN. Do not use Form 8109-B to deposit delinquent
taxes assessed by the IRS. Pay those taxes directly to the IRS. See Pub.
15 (Circular E), Employer’s Tax Guide, for information.
How to complete the form. Enter your name as shown on your return
or other IRS correspondence, address, and EIN in the spaces provided.
Do not make a name or address change on this form (see Form 8822,
Change of Address). If you are required to file a Form 1120, 1120-C,
990-PF (with net investment income), 990-T, or 2438, enter the month in

Form 944
Employer’s ANNUAL Federal Tax Return (includes Forms
944-PR, 944(SP), and 944-SS)

Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). For more information
on EFTPS, go to www.eftps.gov or call 1-800-555-4477.
What’s new. The oval for Form 990-C has been deleted. Form 990-C
has been replaced by Form 1120-C, U.S. Income Tax Return for
Cooperative Associations. Filers of Form 1120-C must use the 1120 oval
when completing Form 8109-B.
The type of tax ovals for the 1120, 1042, and 944 have been moved
on the coupon. Read the type of tax to the right of the oval before you
darken the oval.
After you notify the IRS that you’re going to make payments using Form 8109, 
the IRS will send you preprinted copies of Form 8109 within six weeks. The 
information on Form 8109 is straightforward. Simply fill out the form. Make 

219
 Chapter 13: Accounting for Payroll and Payroll Taxes
sure you use a No. 2 pencil for everything but your name, address, and tele-
phone number, for which you can use ink. The first box asks for the month 
that the tax year ends. If your accounting period starts in January and ends 
in December, enter 12 in the first squares on the form. Fill out the rest of 
the form according to the amount of tax, the type of tax, and the quarter for 
which you’re paying.
Completing End-of-Year Forms
At the end of the year, you have your paperwork cut out for you. You need to 
fill out Forms W-2 and W-3. This section gives you an overview of these two 
forms and what you have to do with each one.
Filling out the W-2
Form W-2 (see Figure 13-6) is the Wage and Tax Statement for a given year. 
Employees usually receive three copies. The employee files one copy with 
the federal return (Copy B) and one copy with the state return (Copy 2). The 
employee keeps the third copy (Copy C) in her personal records. The W-2 
Wage and Tax Statement summarizes all tax deductions for a given year.

✓ Medicare tax withheld
 
✓ Name of state of employment
 
✓ Employer’s state identification number
 
✓ State wages, tips, and other compensation
 
✓ State income tax withheld
Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement consists of the following copies:
 
✓ Copy A: Sent by employer to Social Security Administration.
 
✓ Copy 1: Sent by employer to state, city, or local tax department if required.
 
✓ Copy B: Filed by employee with employee’s federal tax return.
 
✓ Copy C: Kept by employee in employee’s records.
 
✓ Copy 2: Filed by employee with employee’s state, city, or local income taxes.
 
✓ Copy D: Kept by employer in employer’s records.
As an employer, you need to fill out a W-2 for each employee. After you’ve 
completed all of your W-2s, you need to fill out a Form W-3, too. See the next 
section for more about Form W-3.
Filling out the W-3
Form W-3 (see Figure 13-7) is the Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements, 
which the employer has to submit to the Social Security Administration. The 

221
 Chapter 13: Accounting for Payroll and Payroll Taxes
Wage and Tax Statements are your W-2s; the W-3 transmits them. Your W-3 
totals and reports the amounts for all the W-2s it transmits, so both the W-3 
and W-2s are filed with Social Security.

DO NOT STAPLE
Form W-3 is for information purposes only, it just transmits Forms W-2. You 
don’t need to attach any payment to the W-3, but you do have to enclose the 
W-2s the W-3 transmits.
 
The Social Security Administration is very picky about the physical state of 
this form when it arrives. Apparently, Social Security only accepts an original 
copy of this form. The online version is an information-only copy; Copy A of 
this version isn’t clear enough to be scanned properly. So if you download and 
try to submit the online version, you may be charged a $50 penalty if the IRS 
can’t scan your form.
If you want to send your W-3 and W-2s by mail, you can order an official IRS 
form W-3 by calling 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Most payroll software gen-
erates these forms, and you can obtain originals from the IRS walk-in offices. 
You can also file your W-2s and W-3 electronically on the Social Security 
Administration’s Web site at www.socialsecurity.gov/employer.

222
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Where to send the W-2s and W-3s
After you complete these two forms, be sure to send all Copy A’s of Form W-2 
along with Form W-3 by regular mail to the Social Security Administration by 
the due date:
Social Security Administration
Data Operations Center
Wilkes-Barre, PA 18769-0001
 
If you file electronically, you don’t have to mail forms to Social Security, but 
you still need to file these forms by their due dates.
The due dates change from year to year by a day or two. For any tax year, 
you have to file Copy A of Form W-2 and Form W-3 with the Social Security 
Administration by March for the previous year. For more on due dates, go to 
www.irs.gov.
Remember, even though you file Forms W-2 and W-3 electronically with 
Social Security, you’ll still have to distribute the W-2s to your employees and 
you may have to mail forms to your state tax department.
 
Keeping up with your paperwork is important because the IRS matches the 
amounts reported on your quarterly payroll taxes (Forms 941) with the W-2 
amounts totaled on Form W-3. If, however, you do make a mistake when fig-
uring your taxes, you can amend your forms and make corrections by using 
Form 941c, the Supporting Statement to Correct Information. To download 
Form 941c, go to www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f941c.pdf. Make sure you 
submit Form 941c with the next payroll tax Form 941 you file. The corrections 
are detailed on Form 941c and are treated as adjustments to the amount due 
with the current Form 941 you’re filing.
Accounting for Contract Employees: 
Form 1099-MISC
The only employees you don’t have to worry about paying payroll taxes for 
are contract employees because they aren’t your employees; they’re self-
employed. You pay contract employees in full, and at the end of the year, you 
report what you’ve paid them to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous 
Income (see Figure 13-8). Then they — not you — have to pay the piper.

Contract employees offer creative specialties and are not ordinary employ-
ees. For example, some organizations hire accountants, bookkeepers, grant 
writers, and computer experts on contract. Many organizations go through 
temporary agencies to test employees out before they formally hire them. In 
these cases, the contract is with the temporary agencies, not the employees. 
Other organizations place employees on probationary periods of three, six, 
or twelve months before they hire them as permanent employees.
One of the greatest advantages of hiring contract employees is that they 
represent no tax liability for you. Also, if you’re not pleased with their work, 
you can easily let them go. However, most contract employees require signed 
contracts outlining the terms of dismissal, so you may be better off waiting 
until their contract expires before letting them go. The good news is that 
after the contract expires, the employer-employee relationship ends.
At the end of the year, all you have to do for contract employees is give 
them a Form 1099-MISC. Compared to everything you have to do for regular 
employees, filling out the lone Form 1099-MISC is a piece of cake. Take a look 
at Form 1099-MISC in Figure 13-8.
You can complete Form 1099-MISC in just three simple steps before giving it 
to your contract employees:

224
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
 
1. At the top of the form underneath Payer’s, write your name, address, 
telephone number, and federal identification number.
 
2. Underneath Recipient’s, write the contract employee’s identification 
number, name, and address.
 
3. In box number 7, which is labeled Nonemployee compensation, write 
the amount of compensation the contracted employee received in 
that year.
Form 1099-MISC consists of the following copies:
 
✓ Copy A: Sent by nonprofit to the IRS
 
✓ Copy 1: Sent by nonprofit to the state tax department if required
 
✓ Copy B: Sent by nonprofit to contract employee (recipient)
For the tax year ending in December, Form 1099-MISC Copy B is due by 
February of the following year. Copy A of Form 1099-MISC is due by March of 
the following tax year.
The Copy A’s of Form 1099-MISC sent to the IRS are transmitted by Form 1096 
just as Form W-3 transmits Copy A’s of Form W-2. Refer to the instructions 
to Form 1096 to find out where to mail your Copy A’s of Form 1099-MISC with 
Form 1096. You can obtain instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and Form 1096 
at www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html and 
type “1099-MISC” or “1096” in the Find window. You can order an official IRS 
form by calling 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Most payroll software gener-
ates these forms, and you can obtain originals from the IRS walk-in offices. 
You can file Forms 1096 and 1099-MISC with the IRS electronically if you have 
specialized software.
 
Staffing only contract employees sounds like a great way to save money, 
doesn’t it? Well, unfortunately, Uncle Sam doesn’t let you hire only contract 
employees, so you have to find other ways to save money. The Department of 
Wage and Labor has its own auditors who pay close attention to payroll taxes, 
how they’re paid, when they’re paid, and how small establishments handle 
their payroll accounting. If the IRS determines that your contract employees 
(self-employed) are actually statutory employees (your employees), you’ll be 
on the hook for back payroll taxes and penalties. Publications 15 and 15-A pro-
vide you with info to determine who is a statutory employee. Go to www.irs.
gov/app/picklist/list/publicationsNoticesPdf.html and type 
“Publ 15” in the Find window.

Chapter 14
Doing the Accounting 
for Tax Form 990
In This Chapter
▶ Selecting the right form
▶ Avoiding unnecessary penalties
▶ Filing according to standards
Your nonprofit organization is tax exempt, so you’re probably wondering 
why I include a chapter on filing a tax report. You may be surprised to 
find out that even though you don’t have to pay federal income taxes, your 
organization does have to file a return. IRS Form 990, Return of Organization 
Exempt from Income Tax, is an annual information return that most tax-
exempt organizations must file. Although this is a topic most people, includ-
ing myself, may prefer to ignore, failure to accurately complete this form 
leads to repercussions none of us want. The information a tax-exempt organi-
zation provides on this form serves as the primary source of information for 
the public about that particular organization. Therefore, the information you 
provide on this form becomes the basis for how the public and the govern-
ment perceive your organization.
Which version of this form your organization needs to complete depends 
on your organization’s gross receipts. Before getting too worried about this 
form, check out this chapter to find out the steps you need to follow to pre-
pare your information form for the IRS. I wish you could spend all your time 
running the programs that benefit our communities, but there’s a time for 
everything. And right now, it’s tax time!
 
Be prepared for that first phone call or e-mail from a concerned citizen 
requesting your Form 990. Your Form 990 is considered public record and 
must be made available to the public upon request. You have to give your 
Form 990 to whoever requests it with only a minimal charge equal to the cost 
of copying the form. To save paper and time, you can post your Form 990 
on your Web site. When someone requests a copy, you can simply tell that 
person how to locate the forms on your Web site.

226
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Choosing the Right Form: 
Which One Do You Need?
Your gross receipts and total assets from grants, donations, contracts, and 
so on determine which version of Form 990 your organization must file with 
the IRS. Your organization may be exempt from income tax, but you have to 
file one of the following three forms:
 
✓ Form 990-N: Form 990-N, e-Postcard, is for small nonprofits.
 
✓ Form 990-EZ: Form 990-EZ, Short Form Return of Organization Exempt 
from Income Tax, is for medium-sized nonprofits.
 
✓ Form 990: Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, is 
for large nonprofits.
 
The thresholds that determine which version of Form 990 your organization 
needs to fill out change often, so make sure you check the IRS’s Web site, 
www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=184445,00.html, for the 
most up-to-date information. See Table 14-1 for the tax thresholds for tax years 
2008 to 2010.

 Chapter 14: Doing the Accounting for Tax Form 990
Knowing What Happens If 
You Don’t File Form 990
If you don’t file your personal income taxes, you know Uncle Sam gets upset. 
The same is true for your organization. Although your nonprofit isn’t required 
to pay federal taxes, you still need to file Form 990. If you don’t file, you put your-
self and your organization on Uncle Sam’s bad side. Make sure you file Form 990 
to avoid any repercussions and dire consequences for your nonprofit.
What happens when you don’t file Form 990 or you send in an incomplete 
form? You pay the following penalties:
 
✓ The IRS charges smaller organizations a penalty of $20 a day, not 
to exceed the lesser of $10,000 or 5 percent of the gross receipts of 
the organization for the year, when you file a return late, unless you 
can show that the late filing was the result of a reasonable cause. 
Organizations with annual gross receipts exceeding $1 million are sub-
ject to a penalty of $100 for each day they fail to file (with a maximum 
penalty of $50,000 for any one return). The penalty begins on the due 
date. Additionally, the organization can lose its exempt status.
 
✓ If your organization doesn’t file a complete return or doesn’t furnish cor-
rect information, the IRS sends the organization a letter that includes 
a fixed time period during which you can resubmit the form. After that 
period expires, the IRS charges the person who fails to comply a penalty 
of $10 a day, with a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any one return.
 
You only have to give up information about your nonprofit; you don’t have to 
include a check with this return.
Others will play finance detective
With the availability of your Form 990 on the 
Internet, donors can easily investigate whether 
your organization has been a good steward of 
donor investments. They look up your IRS Form 
990 to see how much money you brought in, 
what you did with the money, and how much 
you paid your executive director. Many donors 
are skeptical about giving to charitable orga-
nizations because some aren’t doing the right 
thing. Donors want to know that they’re giving 
to a reputable organization; they don’t want to 
worry about misuse of their money.
Donors may decide whether to donate to your 
organization based on the financial picture they 
glean from reviewing this form. Your Form 990 
reveals the same information found on financial 
statements; the form just makes it easier for the 
government and public to analyze your numbers.
You can find Form 990s online at www.charity
navigator.org, www.guidestar.org, 
and www.foundationcenter.org.

228
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Understanding the Minimal Requirements: 
Form 990-N (e-Postcard)
The IRS created Form 990-N specifically for small, tax-exempt nonprofit orga-
nizations that gross less than $25,000 a year. See Table 14-1 in the “Choosing 
the Right Form: Which Form Do You Need?” section of this chapter for more 
information on the gross receipts you need to use this form. Form 990-N is an 
electronic notice and very easy to complete, which is why it’s also called the 
e-Postcard. You need to file this form every year by the 15th day of the fifth 
month after the end of a tax-exempt organization’s fiscal year. For a calendar 
year, the deadline is May 15.
For many years, the IRS didn’t require small nonprofits that made less than $25,000 
a year to submit any paperwork, but things have changed. Don’t fret, though. 
Filling out Form 990-N is quick and simple. Here’s what you must provide:
 
✓ Organization’s employer identification number (EIN)
 
✓ Organization’s name
 
✓ Any other names your organization uses
 
✓ Organization’s mailing address (usually the board secretary’s address)
 
✓ Organization’s Web site address (if applicable)
 
✓ Name and address of a principal officer of your organization (usually the 
executive director)
 
✓ Organization’s annual tax period
 
✓ A confirmation that your organization’s annual gross receipts are nor-
mally $25,000 or less
If applicable, indicate whether your organization is going out of business. The 
IRS needs to know if your nonprofit is no longer operating because it regu-
lates nonprofits.
 
The IRS requires that Form 990-N be filed electronically. No paper form is avail-
able. To file Form 990-N, you must have access to the Internet, but you don’t 
have to download any software. If your nonprofit doesn’t have a computer, you 
can fill out Form 990-N using the computer of a friend, a relative, or your public 
library. You can find Form 990-N at http://epostcard.form990.org.
 
If you don’t file your e-Postcard on time, the IRS sends you a reminder notice, 
but the IRS won’t assess a penalty for filing the e-Postcard late. However, an 
organization that fails to file required e-Postcards (or Forms 990 or 990-EZ, for 
that matter) for three consecutive years automatically loses its tax-exempt 
status. The revocation for the organization’s tax-exempt status doesn’t take 
place until the filing due date of the third year.

 Chapter 14: Doing the Accounting for Tax Form 990
Filling Out Form 990-EZ
Form 990-EZ (see Figure 14-1) is an annual information return that many orga-
nizations exempt from income taxes have to file with the IRS. To find out if 
your organization can file Form 990-EZ rather than Form 990, see Table 14-1 
in the “Choosing the Right Form: Which Form Do You Need?” section of this 
chapter. Basically, Form 990-EZ is a less detailed version of Form 990.

Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
All filing organizations must complete the top portion of the form and Parts I 
through V. The top portion of the form is self-explanatory with simple ques-
tions that identify you by name and EIN. Just fill in the blanks.
Parts I through V require information about the organization’s exempt and 
other activities, finances, compliance with certain federal tax filings and 
requirements, and compensation paid to certain people. These five parts, 
along with the information you need to include in each part, are as follow:
 
✓ Part I — Revenue, Expenses, and Changes in Net Assets or Fund Balances: 
This part is basically your nonprofit organization’s statement of activities. 
Part I is logically divided into revenues, expenses, and net assets.
 
✓ Part II — Balance Sheets: This part provides your organization with a 
simplified version of its statement of financial position (see Chapter 16 
for more information on this statement). You can use the numbers from 
your statement of financial position to fill in some of the info in this part.
 
✓ Part III — Statement of Program Service Accomplishments: Here you 
get to showcase your major accomplishments during the year. In this 
part, you report organizational and financial accomplishments that 
relate to your nonprofit’s core program areas. Your responses to the 
questions in this part highlight your accomplishments. Just answer the 
questions, and before you know it, you’re moving on to Part IV.
 
✓ Part IV — List of Officers, Directors, Trustees, and Key Employees: In 
this part, your organization has to report the income for its most highly 
compensated employees. If your organization provides no compensa-
tion, you should list the top three officers, such as president or execu-
tive director, treasurer, and secretary.
 
✓ Part V — Other Information: In this part, you have to answer a 
series of questions according to each question’s specific instructions. 
Understanding all these questions is important because they disclose 
information about unrelated business income, the person who takes 
care of your books, and any new activities not reported in the prior year.
Only Section 501(c)(3) organizations have to complete Part VI. The questions 
in Part VI ask about your political activities, changes to your bylaws, unre-
lated business income, and so on. Because these questions are fairly basic, 
you can answer them rather easily. For example, one question asks you for the 
five highest paid employees. All the questions in Part VI are straightforward.
Furthermore, you may need to complete additional schedules depending on 
the type of your organization and its activities. A schedule is a supplemen-
tal form with questions pertaining to a specific subject or topic that the IRS 
requires you to fill out, depending on your responses on other tax forms. Form 
990-EZ requests information regarding specific activities on two schedules:
 
✓ Schedule A requests information regarding compensation of indepen-
dent contractors and highest compensated employees, the basis for an 

231
 Chapter 14: Doing the Accounting for Tax Form 990
organization’s public charity status, a private school’s nondiscrimina-
tion policies and practices, lobbying, specified activities posing compli-
ance concerns, and transactions or relationships with noncharitable 
exempt organizations.
 
✓ Schedule B requests certain charitable contributions and contributor 
information.
You can find Form 990-EZ at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/f990rez.pdf. 
(See the “Submitting Form 990” section for details on what to do with the 
form after you complete it.)
Filling Out Form 990
Form 990 is the primary reporting mechanism for all organizations that are 
exempt from federal income tax (see Figure 14-2). Every exempt organization that 
doesn’t meet the requirements for the shorter Form 990-N or Form 990-EZ has to 
file Form 990 and must complete the top portion of the form and Parts I through 
XI. See Table 14-1 in the “Choosing the Right Form: Which Form Do You Need?” 
section of this chapter for the requirements of the three versions of Form 990.
The next sections help you understand how to complete Form 990 and how 
to submit it.
Walking through Form 990
Form 990 isn’t an overly complex form to complete. You can find a lot of the 
information you need on your nonprofit’s financial statements. First, you 
have to fill out the top portion of the form by following the directions and 
reporting general information about your organization, such as its name, 
address, EIN, and so on. The specific parts of Form 990 are as follows. Note 
that you can use Part IV, Checklist of Required Schedules, to determine 
which schedules, if any, you must complete in addition to the form itself (see 
the “Filling Out Form 990-EZ” section for more on schedules).
 
✓ Part I — Summary: This part basically asks you to summarize your 
organization. It requests details regarding your organization’s activities 
and governance, revenue, expenses, and net assets.
 
✓ Part II — Signature Block: This part requires your signature to verify that 
the information on this form is correct to the best of your knowledge.
 
✓ Part III — Statement of Program Service Accomplishments: Simply put, 
this part is where the organization describes its accomplishments in the 
services it provides. It requests the amount of grant money and alloca-
tions your organization received for the services provided, along with all 
expenses related to the programs.

✓ Part IV — Checklist of Required Schedules: This part determines whether 
you need to complete any schedules in addition to Form 990 itself.
 
✓ Part V — Statements Regarding Other IRS Filings and Tax Compliance: 
This part alerts your organization to other potential federal tax compli-
ance and filing obligations it has.

233
 Chapter 14: Doing the Accounting for Tax Form 990
 
✓ Part VI — Governance, Management, and Disclosure: This part con-
tains three sections: governing body and management, policies, and 
disclosure. These sections pose questions concerning the organization’s 
conflict of interest policies and monitoring system. This part also asks 
about the review of Form 990 by voting members of the organization’s 
governing board.
 
✓ Part VII — Compensation of Officers, Directors, Trustees, Key 
Employees, Highest Compensated Employees, and Independent 
Contractors: This part requires the organization to report the calendar-
year amounts paid to compensate employees and independent contrac-
tors, taken from W-2 and 1099 forms (see Chapter 13 for more about 
these forms).
 
✓ Part VIII — Statement of Revenue: Just as its title states, this part is 
where you state all your organization’s sources of revenue, including 
contributions such as grants and gifts, program service revenue, and 
fundraising revenue.
 
✓ Part IX — Statement of Functional Expenses: This part requires you to 
list your organization’s expenses by category. The expense categories 
include program service, management, and fundraising.
 
✓ Part X — Balance Sheet: This part requires you to fill in the information 
found on your statement of financial position. Refer to your own state-
ment to help you fill out this part (see Chapter 16 for more information 
on statements of financial position).
 
✓ Part XI — Financial Statements and Reporting: This part asks ques-
tions regarding the organization’s accounting methods, and financial 
statement reporting and preparation.
Submitting Form 990
Whew! The worst is over. You’ve completed Form 990. Now all you have to do is 
turn it in on time to avoid late fees. Form 990 is due by the 15th day of the fifth 
month after your organization’s fiscal year ends. If you fail to turn it in on time, 
you have to pay fees of $20 a day up to the amount of $10,000 or 5 percent of 
your organization’s gross receipts, depending on which amount is lower.
Be sure to review the form for any omitted information so you don’t have to 
pay the fee for incomplete returns (a fee of $10 a day up to $5,000).
 
Your organization can file Form 990 and related forms, schedules, and attach-
ments electronically or by private delivery service. However, if an organiza-
tion files 250 returns of any type during the calendar year and has total assets 
of $10 million or more at the end of the tax year, that organization must file 
Form 990 electronically. If your organization meets this requirement but does 
not file electronically, the IRS does not recognize that your organization filed 
its return, even if you submitted a paper return.

234
Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Completing Form 990-T (Reporting 
Unrelated Business Income)
Your nonprofit may be subject to corporate income taxes if you engage 
in for-profit business enterprises in which you gain unrelated business 
income. Unrelated business income is any income generated by a business 
that is regularly carried on and unrelated to the exempt function of your 
nonprofit.
The IRS rule states that all nonprofits that have $1,000 or more in gross 
receipts from an unrelated business transaction must file Form 990-T, Exempt 
Organization Business Income Tax Return (see Figure 14-3). You have to file 
Form 990-T to provide the IRS information about your nonprofit’s
 
✓ Unrelated business income: If your nonprofit conducts a trade or busi-
ness that produces income by selling merchandise or providing a ser-
vice that isn’t related to the cause or purpose of your organization, the 
income generated is considered unrelated business income if the trade 
or business activity takes place on a regular basis.
 
✓ Unrelated business income tax liability: This tax liability is the amount 
over $1,000 that your nonprofit earns for unrelated business transac-
tions. This includes all gross income less deductions directly connected 
with producing the income.
 
✓ Proxy tax liability: This deals with notice requirements of nondeduct-
ible lobbying and political campaigning activities engaged in by certain 
membership associations that hold a tax-exempt status such as, 501(c)4, 
501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6).
You can find Form 990-T online at www.irs.gov. After you log on to the 
Web site, type Form 990-T in the Search box. As with all tax forms, you can 
call the IRS for technical assistance, but if you’re not comfortable with the 
answers you get from the IRS, consult a tax accountant or CPA.
 
Be careful with activities outside the scope of tax-exempt purpose. These 
unrelated business transactions can come back to bite you in the butt. 
Engaging in excessive unrelated business transactions (50 percent or more 
of your total transactions) can change the status of your organization from a 
nonprofit to a for-profit, which means you lose your exempt status. As long 
as you stay within the scope of the tax-exempt purpose of your nonprofit, 
though, you don’t have anything to worry about.

Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Handling IRS Form 990 
Extensions and Mistakes
Sometimes you may need a little extra time to file Form 990. Or, perhaps you 
noticed an error after submitting it. So what happens when you can’t finish 
completing the form on time or you do complete the form on time, but you 
later discover you made a mistake? Don’t worry — all is not lost. The follow-
ing sections provide you with solutions to both of these issues.
Requesting an extension
If you find you’re running out of time and you can’t meet the IRS’s deadline 
for filing Form 990, you can request an extension. Use Form 8868, Application 
for Extension of Time to File an Exempt Organization Return, to request an 
automatic three-month extension (see Figure 14-4). You can also use this 
form to apply for an additional three-month extension if the original three 
months aren’t enough. This second extension is not automatic; to obtain a 
second extension, your organization must show reasonable cause for the 
additional time requested. This is a fairly easy form to fill out.
 
Most nonprofits file extensions because CPA fees are less expensive during less 
busy times. For example, if you require a CPA during peak season (January 1 
through April 15), the hourly rate you have to pay is much higher than it is 
during the rest of the year. This fact goes back to supply and demand — if the 
demand for a service is high, the cost to supply it goes up, too.
Correcting Form 990 mistakes
As humans, we all make mistakes. If you need to make a correction to your 
Form 990, you just need to file a new return (make sure to include any 
required schedules with it). Use the version of Form 990 applicable to the 
year of the form being changed. The changed return must provide all the 
information requested by the form and instructions — not just the new or 
corrected information.
To correct a mistake:
 
✓ Check the amended return box in the heading of the return.
 
✓ State in Schedule O which parts and schedules of Form 990 you 
amended and describe the amendments.

Part III: Accounting for Nonprofit Situations 
Your organization can file an amended return at any time. You have to make 
your amended return available for public inspection for three years from the 
date of filing or three years from the date the original return was due, which-
ever is later.
If you submit supplemental information or file an amended Form 990 or 
990-EZ with the IRS, you should also send a copy of the information or 
amended return to any state with which you filed a copy of your original 
Form 990 or 990-EZ to meet that state’s filing requirements.
 
State laws vary concerning their treatment of nonprofits. If a state requires 
your organization to file an amended Form 990 or 990-EZ to correct conflicts 
with the Form 990 or 990-EZ instructions, your organization must also file an 
amended return with the IRS.
Keeping in Line with IRS Regulations
Understanding and complying with the rules and guidelines pertaining to 
nonprofits is important to keeping your nonprofit, tax-exempt status. The 
board is responsible for ensuring the organization complies with accounting 
practices, as well as local, state, and federal laws. Nonprofit administrators 
look to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for guidelines regarding unrelated 
business income and the disclosure of relevant information about revenues.
The IRS granted your tax-exempt status, which relieves you from paying 
income taxes like those for-profit organizations pay. In exchange for your 
exemption, you’re supposed to enjoy your tax-free status and not compete 
with for-profits. The IRS has a very detailed schedule (Schedule B to Form 
990) for reporting and disclosing information about your donors. I address 
unrelated business income and donation disclosure in the following sections.
Reporting nonprofit unrelated 
business income
Before you decide to enter into a money-making venture, evaluate how the 
venture relates to your mission and how it may affect your nonprofit status. 
Income earned for activities outside the scope of an organization’s tax-exempt 
purpose is called unrelated business income (UBI). You should ask yourself 
three questions to determine whether income is unrelated business income:

239
 Chapter 14: Doing the Accounting for Tax Form 990
 
✓ Is the income earned from a trade or business?
 
✓ Is the income earned from your regular daily operations?
 
✓ Is the income unrelated to the tax-exempt purpose of your charitable 
organization?
If you answer yes to any of these questions, two things could happen: Your 
nonprofit may owe income taxes, and it could lose its nonprofit tax-exempt 
status.
If you have more than $1,000 in gross receipts from the sale of goods and 
services unrelated to your nonprofit status, then you must file Form 990-T, 
Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return, and you may have to pay 
income taxes on those receipts. 
 
If your nonprofit receives 20 percent of its total income from a money-making 
venture, the IRS may declare your organization a for-profit entity, and you 
could lose your tax-exempt status.
To access more information from the IRS on tax-exempt organizations, visit 
its Web site at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p598.pdf.
In addition to the federal requirements, you must stay abreast of your state 
and local laws about earning unrelated business income. Because state laws 
vary, I suggest that you visit the following Web site to find information about 
your state: www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=129028,00.html.
Reporting nonprofit contributions
The Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) establishes the standards 
(GAAP) for recognizing donations and contributions made or received.
The guidelines state that you should keep the following information about all 
contributions received:
 
✓ Pledges or promises to give should be recorded in the accounting 
records if they are deemed unconditional (not contingent on some uncer-
tain future event).
 
✓ Donated services or in-kind contributions of volunteer time or special-
ized skills, such as those provided by accountants, medical personnel, 
computer technicians, and others, must be included in the financial 
statements.

aving a viable set of financial records that reflect 
your true financial position is your goal. At the end 
of the year, you want to create a summary of all account-
ing activities for the current accounting period and pre-
pare the accounts for the next one. Your statement of 
activities indicates whether you’re operating in the black 
or red. Your statement of financial position shows your 
solvency versus liquidity. Your cash flow statement routes 
cash according to activity. Your statement of functional 
expense evaluates your expenses based on their functions. 
Finally, your notes to the financial statements summarize 
any significant changes to accounting methods and all con-
tingent liabilities.
This part explains each of these financial statements in 
more detail and helps you create each one for your 
organization.
This part also covers the final step after your accounting 
period expires — taking your records and financial 
statements to an independent accounting firm to get an 
audit. This audit justifies whether your books have been 
presented according to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP).

R
arely do financial disasters happen overnight. When I hear a news 
report about a nonprofit closing its doors due to lack of funding, I real-
ize that the situation probably could have been avoided with proper financial 
oversight. Usually the statement of activities contains signs that, if properly 
evaluated, reveal the likelihood of trouble and ways to avoid disaster. Good 
financial managers use their statement of activities, also referred to as 
income statements, as planning tools and indicators of future events. (For an 
introduction to the basics of the statement of activities, flip to Chapter 3.)
Information found on a statement of activities provides
 
✓ A summary of transactions, events, and circumstances that change an 
organization’s net assets
 
✓ Information about the relationship between transactions and events
 
✓ How revenues are used to provide program services
By evaluating your statement of activities on a frequent basis, you know 
where your resources come from, how and when they flow, and how to set 
your course. Knowing how you’re doing compared to what you’ve planned 
can help you make necessary changes. In this chapter I explain how to come 
up with the numbers on your statement of activities and how to use those 
numbers to strategically plan and carefully forecast and track your donations 
and expenses.

Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Understanding the True Meaning 
of the Statement of Activities
Your statement of activities is a summary of all the income that you’ve earned 
and every expense that you’ve incurred for a particular time period. It also 
shows whether your net assets or equity have increased or decreased over 
that time period.
Just like large corporations evaluate their expenses and make conscious 
efforts to downsize, you may need to consider doing the same thing when 
operating your nonprofit. Choosing what to cut and what to keep requires 
careful evaluation of your revenue sources, restrictions on those resources, 
and your expenses. In addition, you can compare planned expenses, just like 
you compare revenues, to keep your spending on track.
In a nutshell, your statement of activities (see Figure 15-1) indicates whether 
your nonprofit has extra money to operate with or whether your nonprofit is 
operating in a deficit position. (A deficit is a negative amount that means 
that you’ve used all of your revenues and them some, and you’re in financial 
trouble.) Basically the statement of activities indicates whether you’ve had a 
good year (ending in the black) or a bad year (ending in the red).
 
You can use your statement of activities to evaluate ways to downsize or 
cut expenses and increase revenue streams. When created on a monthly or 
quarterly basis, your statement of activities can be used to
 
✓ Focus on peak periods when contributions are up
 
✓ Plan for the downtimes when contributions come in slowly
Knowing your peak periods and slow periods can help you plan to sustain 
your nonprofit during the slow periods.
 
Tracking your revenues and expenses on a monthly, quarterly, and annual 
basis helps you make better decisions about what expenses to keep and what 
to give up. When revenues decrease, most organizations look for ways to 
reduce expenses. As a general rule, most nonprofits try to keep administrative 
costs down to have more funds available for programs.
 
You’ll need your chart of accounts to set up your statement of activities. This 
chart lists your ledger account names and numbers arranged in the order in 
which they appear in your financial statements. You use the account numbers 
instead of the account names when you put together financial statements. 
(For more about your chart of accounts, see Chapter 5).
Before you can fully use this important statement, you first need a firm grasp 
of what the statement of activities shows. The following sections reveal what 
information is found on this statement.

Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Revenues
Basically, you have two types of donations to account for on the statement of 
activities:
 
✓ Unrestricted support: This money can be used for anything. For 
example, a donor gives $10,000 to your nonprofit and doesn’t specify 
how you can spend the money.
 
✓ Restricted support: These donations have strings attached or imposed 
sanctions. When your nonprofit receives restricted gifts, you have a 
legal obligation to comply with the donor’s restrictions. There are two 
types of restricted support:
 
• Temporarily restricted support: The donor places a short-term 
restriction on the funds’ use.
 
• Permanently restricted support: The donor places permanent 
restrictions on the money’s usage.
 
 If your board of directors designates a portion of unrestricted support 
for a specific purpose, it may be called an appropriation or board-
designated support. Board-designated funds aren’t restricted in the same 
way as donor-restricted support. A board can change its mind and 
remove this self-imposed limit on some resource, but it can’t change 
the limitation placed on resources contributed from an outside donor. 
Remember boards are inside the organization and they designate; 
donors are outside the organization and they restrict.
 
 When all the conditions have been met and you’ve fulfilled the agree-
ment or met the donor’s requirements, restricted support is reported as 
net assets released from restrictions. You simply move the amount of the 
previously restricted funds from one category to another. For example, 
while the funds were restricted, they were reported as restricted net 
assets; when the restrictions are released, the funds are reported as 
unrestricted net assets. Your overall bottom line doesn’t change. You’ve 
merely moved funds from one category to another by simultaneously 
increasing unrestricted net assets and decreasing restricted net assets.
To classify revenues on your statement of activities, you should list the totals 
from all accounts from your general ledger beginning with the number 4. 
These will include individual contributions, grant support, special events, 
ticket revenue, unrelated business income, in-kind contributions, and all 
other sources of income earned by your nonprofit. After you’ve listed all 
your income sources, add them up. In Figure 15-1, you can see from the trial 
balance how revenue accounts are identified.
When restrictions on gifts are met, the restricted support is simultaneously 
reported as an increase to unrestricted net assets and a decrease to 
restricted net assets in the revenue, gains, and support (income) section of 
the statement of activities.

247
 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Statement of Activities
Expenses
Your nonprofit incurs overhead (operating) and program expenses. 
Depending on your establishment, you may have program, general manage-
ment, and fundraising expenses. You won’t forget to include your expenses if 
you refer back to your chart of accounts and your general ledger.
You report all expenses on the statement of activities as decreases in 
unrestricted net assets. You do this by adding up all of your expenses and 
subtracting them from unrestricted revenues. For example, look at Figure 
15-1 and notice how all the expenses are subtracted from unrestricted 
support only. The difference between revenues and expenses equals a 
change in net assets.
Gains and losses
Gains and losses come from activities that are incidental to an organization’s 
central activities or from events and circumstances beyond the organiza-
tion’s control. Gains are reported in the revenue section and losses are 
reported in the expense section of the statement of activities. Gains increase 
net assets and losses decrease net assets. There are two types of gains or 
losses:
 
✓ Realized gains and losses essentially come from transactions or events 
that have occurred. The economic impact has happened and can be felt. 
A transaction example is the gain or loss from the sale or disposition of 
an organization’s investments or some other asset it owns. You have a 
gain when you receive more than the asset’s cost and a loss when you 
receive less than its cost. An event example is a loss from a fire where 
the fire caused a decrease in value of an asset.
 
✓ Unrealized gains and losses come from the change in fair market 
value of investments that an organization holds. The nonprofit hasn’t 
sold the investments so there is no realized gain or loss. However, 
there has been a gain or loss in the value of the asset, it just hasn’t been 
realized or felt because the asset hasn’t been sold, the gain or loss 
is unrealized. Because GAAP requires investments to be reported at 
fair market value on the statement of financial position, you have to 
have a mechanism to reflect the economic change in the statement of 
activities, which effects net assets and therefore keeps the statement of 
financial position in balance. Whew, that’s why there are unrealized 
gains and losses!
You record all gains and losses (realized and unrealized) recognized on the 
statement of activities as increases or decreases in unrestricted net assets 
unless their use is restricted by stipulation of the donor or by law. (For more 
on the treatment of gains and losses, see Financial Accounting Standard

and Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement Number 124, www.
fasb.org/pdf/aop_FAS124.pdf.)
What this statement doesn’t show
There are a few limitations to the statement of activities. You may have a few 
things of value that you may not be able to accurately measure or report on 
the statement. These include
 
✓ Uncollectible accounts and pledges receivable: They are assets and 
potential liabilities, and are reported on the statement of financial 
position. Changes in the estimate of the amount of uncollectible 
receivables changes revenue in the statement of activities, but the total 
value of the estimate is reported on the statement of financial position.
 
✓ Accumulated depreciation: Although you report the depreciation 
expense for any year on the statement of activities, you report the 
depreciation expense that has accumulated over the years on the state-
ment of financial position as accumulated depreciation. Accumulated 
depreciation holds the write-off amount to keep the current value of a 
fixed asset accurately stated on the books. It reduces the carrying value 
of the fixed asset. (See Chapter 2 for more about depreciation.)
 
✓ People’s loyalty and devotion to your organization: Even if someone 
tried to measure these attributes, it would be difficult to put a number 
on them.
Evaluating the Data
You can use your statement of activities to analyze more than just the total 
revenues earned and expenses incurred for a given period. For example, you 
can compare the following:
 
✓ Current month revenues and expenses to prior months
 
✓ Current quarterly revenues and expenses to prior quarters
 
✓ Current annual revenue and expenses to prior years
Depending on your scope of services, you can also use your statement of 
activities to
 
✓ Compare your data to similar organizations
 
✓ Track how economic conditions affect your contributions
 
✓ Evaluate changes in giving trends

249
 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Statement of Activities
 
✓ Position yourself to better focus on organization and program efficiency
 
✓ Identify programs or areas that need your immediate attention
You can also use information found on the statement of activities to figure 
out what percentage of your revenues come from
 
✓ Individual donors (private)
 
✓ Foundations
 
✓ Corporate sponsors
 
✓ Fundraising
 
✓ Grants
 
✓ Fees for program goods and services provided
 
Knowing where your resources come from can help you to assess your 
capability of generating future revenues.
I cover all of these topics in the following sections.
Analyzing revenues and expenses
The numbers alone on your nonprofit’s statement of activities don’t have 
much meaning. You want to analyze and determine the relationship of its 
parts and how the results affect your nonprofit.
To analyze the numbers on a statement of activities, you need to convert the 
numbers to percentages, which gives you a better idea of what percentage 
of revenues come from which sources and which categories of expenses 
are too high. When the dollar amounts are converted into percentages, it 
shows how significant the components of your income statement are. Then 
when you compare revenues and expenses, you can better understand the 
relationship between the two. Reducing numbers to a simpler form helps 
you discover the true relationship of the parts of the statement of activities 
to the whole.
Take a look at the following example, which shows how much money a 
hypothetical nonprofit collected:
Revenues Collected for 2009
Individual donors
$45,000
Corporate sponsors
$25,000
Foundation grants
$85,000
Government grants
$300,000
Fee for services
$45,000
Total revenues collected
$500,000

250
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
By converting these figures into percentages, you can evaluate the revenues 
much easier.
 
To calculate the percentage for each revenue collected, divide the amount 
by the total revenues collected. For example, take the $45,000 collected from 
individual donors and divide it by $500,000, which is the total amount of 
revenues collected ($45,000 ÷ $500,000 = 0.09 or 9%). This means that $45,000 
is 9 percent of $500,000, so you know that 9 percent of the revenues came 
from individuals.
 
Be sure to double check your math by adding up the percentages. Your total 
should equal 100 percent.
The result of converting the revenues from each source into a percentage is 
shown in the following table:
Percentage of Revenues from Sources
Individual donors
9%
Corporate sponsors
5%
Foundation grants
17%
Government grants
60%
Fees for services
9%
Total revenues collected
100%
Based on these percentages, this organization is relying heavily on grants, 
to the tune of 77 percent of its revenues (17 percent from foundation grants 
plus 60 percent from government grants).
Although I wouldn’t attempt to operate a nonprofit organization without 
grants because they’re important to a nonprofit’s funding, having this much 
money coming from grants can be a good or bad thing. If an aggressive 
grant writing campaign is ongoing, then it may be okay. But if the nonprofit 
isn’t aggressively seeking new grants, then it’s putting itself in a precarious 
position because grants aren’t permanent sources of income. The nonprofit 
could be in danger of running low on revenues when the grants end. (For 
more information about applying for grants, see Chapter 10.)
Evaluating your expenses just like the revenues gives you a better indication of 
how much money is going to administrative, program, and overhead expenses. 
For more information about administrative expenses, see Chapter 18.
Determining change in net assets
A complete statement of activities indicates whether you’ve increased or 
decreased your net assets over a given period. Subtracting total expenses 
from revenues equals either a positive number or a negative number.

251
 Chapter 15: Analyzing the Statement of Activities
 
✓ A positive number means you’ve taken in more revenues than you have 
expenses. This is excess income, a surplus and you’re “in the black.”
 
✓ A negative number means your expenses are higher than your 
revenues. A negative number equals a loss, a deficit which means 
you’re “in the red.”
For example, if your total revenues are $100,000 and your total expenses 
are $95,000, then your change in net assets is a surplus of $5,000. But if your 
total revenues are $100,000 and your total expenses are $105,000, then 
your change in net assets is a $5,000 loss. Remember: Revenues – Expenses = 
Change in net assets
In the private sector, stockholders benefit from the difference between 
revenues and expenses by collecting dividends paid from the company’s 
profits. In the nonprofit sector, stakeholders are the beneficiaries (your 
donors, as well as the people you help), and the money that’s left after 
you’ve paid your expenses is reinvested in the nonprofit. When all revenues 
are collected and all expenses are paid, you need to have a surplus to 
stay afloat. Just because you’re a nonprofit doesn’t mean you don’t need a 
positive difference between revenues and expenses.
Using the statement to make comparisons
As the world changes, so do your nonprofit’s finances. Revenues go up and 
down; expenses go up (and sometimes down). You can use the data on the 
statement of activities to compare
 
✓ Current and historical amounts for your nonprofit
 
✓ Your nonprofit’s finances to other nonprofits in the industry
Seeing how the numbers compare over time
You can compare numbers on your statement of activities on a monthly, 
quarterly, or annual basis. Looking back at previous time frames helps you 
gauge how well you’re doing in the current period.
Comparing your current-year data to prior years shows trends and can help 
your nonprofit focus on important contributors (start with your donors list 
to see how much was given by whom) and high expenses. Of course, some 
expenses are probably up because of the changes in the economy, and there 
may be little that you can do to change that, but you may be able to offset 
other expenses. Take a look at Table 15-1, which compares current year 
revenues and expenses to prior years.

252

Table 15-1 shows a comparative list covering five years of revenues and 
expenses and the change in net assets. If you take what’s happening in 2009 
and compare it to any other year, it gives you a bit more than just looking 
at the numbers. For example, consider revenues starting with 2005 and look 
at what was reported in 2009. If you divided the revenues from any year 
into 2009, it gives you a percentage of change. The same is true for the 
expenses. By dividing the numbers, you can see that the trend of revenues 
increased faster than expenses. It appears that expenses plateau from 2008 
to 2009; I would investigate why to see if this is the start of a trend or a 
single occurrence.
Comparing your nonprofit to other nonprofits
Not a day goes by that the weatherman doesn’t compare today’s temperature 
with last year’s temperature, or even last week’s for that matter. A compari-
son of your nonprofit’s finances to other nonprofits gives you something to 
measure and test your progress by.
Just like people can find your nonprofit’s Form 990, Return of Organization 
Exempt From Income Tax, on the Internet, you can take a gander at other 
nonprofits’ Form 990s too. You can look up your favorite charities and other 
nonprofits with operating budgets and programs similar to yours. Go to the 
following Web site: www.guidestar.org.
 
When comparing your nonprofit to others in the industry, you want to com-
pare apples to apples and oranges to oranges; therefore, try to find a nonprofit 
of similar size and with similar programs in your city. That way you’re both 
subject to the same economic conditions and environment. Of course, you 
first have to be around for a few years before these types of assessments and 
analysis can be compared.
 
Another factor to consider when comparing your statement of activities to 
another agency’s statement is the accounting method used by the other orga-
nization. For example, if the other nonprofit uses the cash method and you’re 
using the accrual basis, then this is not a good comparison. The primary 
difference in the two methods is timing recognition of revenues and expenses. 
For more detail information about these two methods, see Chapter 2.

Chapter 16
Reporting Financial Condition on 
a Statement of Financial Position
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what the statement of financial position reveals
▶ Classifying assets and liabilities
▶ Using the numbers to analyze your position
M
any experts feel that out of all the financial statements, the statement 
of financial position is the most important. The statement of financial 
position (also referred to as the balance sheet) provides a quantitative report 
of your organization’s financial health. It demonstrates responsibility and 
accountability. It also monitors the progress of your organization and its 
financial condition.
This chapter walks you through this important financial statement and 
shows you how to use the numbers on your statement of financial position 
to analyze your nonprofit’s financial health.
Grasping What the Statement 
Says about Your Nonprofit
The statement of financial position reveals what your nonprofit owns 
(the assets) and what it owes (the liabilities) as of a particular date. 
The difference between your nonprofit’s total assets and total liabilities 
equals your nonprofit’s net assets or net worth.
 
If you’re a math person, you can think about what the statement of financial 
position shows in terms of the following equation:
Assets – Liabilities = Net assets

254
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
A statement of financial position reveals the overall value of your organiza-
tion at a point in time. It shows your organization’s solvency (its ability to pay 
its bills) and liquidity (how quickly assets can be converted into cash) at a 
particular point in time.
Internal users (such as board members, accountants, and managers) use the 
statement of financial position to get information about
 
✓ Your nonprofit’s ability to meet its obligations. This is revealed by the 
amount of your current assets, which are used to meet your current 
liabilities. If your current liabilities are greater than the current assets, 
then people will wonder whether you’re having cash flow problems, 
making it difficult to pay your debts.
 
✓ Your organization’s net assets (the difference between what is owned 
and what is owed). You can find this information at the bottom of 
the statement of financial position. Net assets represent the net cumula-
tive results of your nonprofit’s changes in net assets over the years. 
You report the change in net assets for any year on the statement of 
activities; you report the ending net assets on the statement of activities 
on the statement of financial position. Net assets are the accumulation 
of surpluses and deficits over your nonprofit’s history and help explain 
how you acquired some of your assets. You acquire assets by either 
borrowing money to buy them (liabilities) or by spending your own 
surplus funds (this amount is represented by net assets).
 
✓ Your agency’s progress and ability to continue to provide services. 
Simply compare changes in balances from prior periods to the current 
period.
 
✓ The need for external financing. You’re in this situation when your 
current assets won’t cover current debts, or if your long-term assets 
can’t be converted into cash in time to pay current liabilities.
 
✓ The results of economic activity. This is revealed by the overall finan-
cial results as displayed on the statement of financial position as of a 
certain date.
You can tell a lot about an organization by viewing how its finances are 
managed. External users (such as bankers, creditors, and private and 
public donors) use the statement of financial position to evaluate whether 
your nonprofit’s financial position is stable enough to secure a loan or 
whether your nonprofit is worthy of their investments. These folks may 
also take an interest in the same information your internal users look 
at. Additionally, many grant proposals require you to include a copy of all 
financial statements, including the statement of financial position, with the 
proposal.

255
 Chapter 16: Reporting Financial Condition on a Statement of Financial Position
 
Although a statement of financial position is usually only prepared quarterly 
or annually, it represents a single point in time. It’s subject to change 
overnight. So if you’re having a board meeting and your financial condition 
has improved or declined significantly due to a large donation or an 
unexpected large expense, you’ll definitely want to reveal the good or 
bad news by giving your board members copies of the updated statement 
of financial position.
Creating and Reading a Statement 
of Financial Position: The How-To
Doing your own statement of financial position is as easy as 1-2-3. The state-
ment tells a story about your position and condition; it’s an X-ray of your 
financial health. It’s based on what you own (current and long-term assets), 
what you owe (current and long-term liabilities), and the difference between 
the two (net assets).
Creating your very own statement of financial position is simple to do. You 
can use your chart of accounts to help you identify which accounts should 
be included. (If you’re not sure about your chart of accounts, see Chapter 5.)
Before you can create and read your nonprofit’s statement of financial posi-
tion, you need to know what the different numbers mean. Figure 16-1 shows a 
sample statement. As you read this section, follow along in this figure to see 
what the different numbers mean.
Understanding the statement’s structure
The top of your statement of financial position should include the name of 
your nonprofit, the name of the statement (statement of financial position), 
and the date of the balances reported on the statement.
The statement of financial position is like a scale with two sides. It has a top 
half and a bottom half. The top half shows assets, and the bottom half shows 
liabilities and net assets; the two halves have to balance, which is why this 
statement is sometimes called a balance sheet. Take a look at Figure 16-1; the 
top half equals $175,000, and the bottom half equals $175,000, so everything 
at OASIS Inc. is balanced.

 Chapter 16: Reporting Financial Condition on a Statement of Financial Position
Every balance sheet has two main parts:
 
✓ Assets: Assets are always shown first on the statement of financial 
position. Adding all current assets to your fixed assets and other 
long-term assets gives your total assets. When you’ve reached your 
total assets, you’ve finished half of the statement.
 
✓ Liabilities and net assets: In this area on your statement of financial 
position, you add your current liabilities to your long-term liabilities to 
get your total liabilities. Notice in Figure 16-1 that this nonprofit doesn’t 
have any long-term liabilities. This is good, because it means that it’s not 
weighted down in heavy debt.
 
 Net assets equals assets minus liabilities. Don’t confuse assets with net 
assets. In Figure 16-1 the total net assets are $135,000.
 
 One way to understand net assets is to compare it to your payroll check. 
You have gross pay (similar to your nonprofit’s assets) less taxes and 
other deductions (your nonprofit’s liabilities), which equals your net 
pay or the amount you take home (the nonprofit’s net assets).
 
 Underneath net assets, you find restricted and unrestricted net assets. 
Don’t get bogged down with the rhetoric of temporarily restricted, 
permanently restricted, designated assets, and undesignated assets for 
this discussion. You only need to focus on whether they’re restricted or 
unrestricted. Restricted simply means donors have imposed limitations 
or conditions on gifts that will be met at some future time, while 
unrestricted means there were no limits or restrictions on the resources, 
and you’re free to use them however you’d like.
 
 OASIS Inc.’s statement of financial position in Figure 16-1 shows total net 
assets of $135,000. The organization’s net assets come from $12,500 in 
restricted net assets and $122,500 in unrestricted net assets.
 
 To finish the bottom half of the statement of financial position you add 
your total liabilities of $40,000 to your total net assets of $135,000 to get 
your total liabilities and net assets of $175,000. Notice how this is the 
same amount of total assets at the top half of the OASIS Inc. statement of 
financial position. This is how total assets equals total liabilities plus net 
assets. You’ve just completed your statement of financial position. 
You’re done!
 
 A good checkpoint to remember is that total assets will always equal 
liabilities plus net assets.
 
Your statement of financial position is unique, and it shows what you own 
and what you owe. No two organizations will have the exact same statement 
of financial position. So don’t worry if you don’t have every line item listed on 
the statement shown in Figure 16-1.

258
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Here I’ve covered the basics of the statement of financial position and how it 
has to always stay in balance. The following sections explain the different 
parts of the statement of financial position and what information to include in 
the different fields. Here you can see how to create your nonprofit’s very own 
statement of financial position. When you’re preparing your own statement, 
just relax and don’t let the numbers throw you off.
Classifying assets
Assets are classified on the statement of financial position in the order of 
their liquidity. Liquidity means how quickly assets can be converted to 
cash. This section presents asset categories in the order they appear on a 
statement of financial position.
 
To come up with the figures for each category, you simply have to add up all 
the items under each category of assets and take that sum and place it on 
your statement of financial position.
Current assets
Current assets are those items that can be converted into cash within a 
year. Current assets are usually listed in the following order:
 
✓ Cash: Checking and savings account balances (Because cash is the most 
liquid type of asset, it’s listed first.)
 
 Petty cash should be included in the cash category.
 
✓ Marketable securities: U.S. Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, stocks 
and bonds
 
✓ Grants and accounts receivables: Expected to be collected within 
the year
 
 Grants and accounts receivables may also be listed under long-term 
assets, depending on whether the money will be received in the current 
period or future periods.
 
✓ Prepaid expenses: Prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, and supplies 
on hand
Long-term assets
Long-term assets are also referred to as noncurrent assets, which includes 
fixed assets. Long-term assets are items that you can’t convert into cash 
within a year. Long-term assets consist of the following:

259
 Chapter 16: Reporting Financial Condition on a Statement of Financial Position
 
✓ Investments: In the form of bonds, stocks, and real estate that you don’t 
intend to sell within a year.
 
✓ Property, plant, and equipment: Land, buildings, and equipment.
 
✓ Intangibles assets: Copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, 
customer lists, and other assets that you own, have cost you money to 
obtain, and are probably worth more than what they cost you. They’re 
called intangible because they usually don’t have a physical presence, 
and there is uncertainty concerning their future benefits.
 
✓ Other assets: Anything that’s not classified in the other areas.
When talking about long-term assets, you may hear the term capital expendi-
tures. These are purchases of fixed assets, renovation costs, equipment, 
buildings, land, and so on. Often with these purchases you’ll owe a payment 
to a lender for multiple periods. Generally if you buy something that is 
useful for more than one year, the cost should be capitalized. Capital expen-
ditures are classified as plant, property, and equipment on your statement 
of financial position.
Net fixed assets
Net fixed assets equals the price of an asset minus the accumulated deprecia-
tion. Your accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation expense 
charged to assets over the years. (See Chapter 2 for more information about 
depreciation.)
 
Assets are recorded on the statement of financial position at their original 
cost less depreciation except for investments, which are recorded at fair 
market value. Your depreciation expense is listed on your statement of 
activities, but to show the office equipment at its true value on the statement 
of financial position, you have to subtract the accumulated depreciation 
amount from the cost. Figure 16-1 shows office equipment purchased at a 
price of $25,000 less $21,000 (accumulated depreciation) for a value of $4,000.
Total assets
Total assets are your current assets plus long-term and net fixed assets. Your 
total assets include cash in your bank accounts, CDs (certificates of deposit), 
accounts receivables, and the value of all equipment and any other long-term 
assets you have. It’s important that you know how much readily available 
cash you have on hand in order to meet your current obligations on time.
To calculate your total assets, you need to add all current assets to all long-
term and net fixed assets. For the balance sheet in Figure 16-1, the total 
assets are $175,000. The total current assets are $171,000, and the net fixed 
assets are $4,000.

260
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Classifying liabilities and net assets
Knowing your nonprofit’s liabilities is important because you need to have 
assets available to pay your obligations. Have you ever heard someone say, 
“We’re not broke, but our assets are tied up”? This means the organization 
doesn’t have anything it can quickly and easily convert to cash to cover 
what it owes. You need to have current assets to meet your current liabilities 
(liabilities can also be categorized as long term). Not having current assets 
available to pay the bills can cause serious cash flow problems for your 
nonprofit.
Furthermore, by identifying your nonprofit’s net assets, you can see pretty 
quickly how stable your organization is. The difference between your 
total assets and total liabilities gives a quick snapshot of your nonprofit’s 
sustainability. Net assets are the same as net worth for a person, and the 
two are calculated the same way (total assets minus total liabilities).
 
In the notes to your financial statements, you should disclose information 
about the maturity of assets and liabilities and all restrictions on their usage. 
(See Chapter 19 for more info.)
Current liabilities
Current liabilities represent items that will be paid off within one year. 
Current liabilities require your nonprofit to have current assets for their 
payment. Some common current liabilities include the following:
 
✓ Accounts payable: These include credit card payments or purchases 
from vendors on credit.
 
✓ Salaries payable: This category is for salary expenses incurred but not 
yet paid at the end of the period.
 
✓ Payroll taxes: These are payable for state and federal taxes owed on 
salaries.
 
To identify your current liabilities, just take a look at your chart of accounts. 
Of course, the specific financial information can be found in your ledger. Just 
add the totals to get your total current liabilities.
In Figure 16-1, there are two current liabilities, accounts payable and deferred 
revenue, which total $40,000. (Deferred revenues are payments received in 
advance before a service or product is delivered. Sometimes people will 
make an annual donation prior to the year to be used. Sometimes these are 
called refundable advances.)

261
 Chapter 16: Reporting Financial Condition on a Statement of Financial Position
Long-term liabilities
Having too much debt can be risky business. To determine how much of this 
risky debt your nonprofit has on its books, you can look at the long-term 
liabilities on the balance sheet. Long-term liabilities represent obligations that 
will be paid in future periods. Some common long-term liabilities are
 
✓ Notes payable for mortgages and land payments.
 
✓ Equipment payable for vehicles and heavy-duty copy machines.
 
✓ Bank loan payable for money borrowed for working capital. Working 
capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities, 
and it measures an entity’s ability to meet its short-term debts. I explain 
how to figure this amount in the “Calculating working capital” section 
later in this chapter.
 
To come up with long-term liabilities, add up the amounts for all obligations 
that you owe that aren’t due or payable within a year. These consist of 
long-term debts, such as mortgages, vehicles, heavy machinery, and so on. 
In Figure 16-1, OASIS Inc. has no long-term debts.
Net assets
Net assets are essentially what you’re worth or the difference between your 
total assets and your total liabilities. Net assets can be classified as restricted 
or unrestricted, and your donors determine whether net assets are restricted 
or not; if donors choose to restrict their gifts, they set the terms and length 
of the restrictions.
In the for-profit world, retained earnings is the net difference between 
liabilities and assets on the balance sheet. In the nonprofit world, we have 
net assets. First, you should consider the beginning balance in net assets plus 
or minus current period net assets to get the ending balance of net assets.
 
Asset accounts (statement of financial position accounts) aren’t closed at 
the end of the accounting year. Statement of financial position accounts are 
considered real or permanent accounts. The only accounts that are closed 
are revenue, expense, and income summary accounts.
When preparing financial statements, you always prepare the statement of 
activities first, because you close the end results of revenues minus expenses 
to net assets.
There is a direct relationship between what happens on the statement of 
activities and the statement of financial position. Your end results from 
the statement of activities accounts (revenues – expenses = increases 
or decreases in net assets) is transferred to your statement of financial 

262
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
position. This is why the statement of activities is the first financial statement 
prepared. You can’t prepare the statement of financial position until after 
you have the difference between revenues and expenses.
You need to report your net assets on your statement of financial position. 
They help keep the statement of financial position (balance sheet) in balance. 
You calculate and report the beginning net asset balances, the change 
in those balances, and the ending net asset balances on the statement of 
activities. These ending net asset balances also appear underneath liabilities 
on the statement of financial position.
In the OASIS Inc. statement of financial position in Figure 16-1, you see 
temporary restricted net assets of $12,500 and total unrestricted net assets 
of $122,500 for total net assets of $135,000.
 
You can double-check yourself when calculating your net assets by thinking 
of net assets as the difference between total assets (listed on the top of 
the balance sheet) and total liabilities. The total assets are $175,000, and 
the total liabilities are $40,000. Therefore, OASIS Inc.’s total net assets are 
$135,000 ($175,000 – $40,000 = $135,000). As with all equations, if you have two 
parts, you can figure out the third number. Also double-check that the net 
asset balances on the statement of activities agree with the balances on the 
statement of financial position.
Restricted net assets
Sometimes donors make contributions but place some restrictions on how 
and/or when the money may be used. These contributions are called 
restricted contributions and create restricted net assets. Donors may restrict the 
money for a wide variety of functions, including to buy a new building, start a 
new program, or build an endowment. Your donors will tell you if a gift is 
restricted when they give it to you. It’s your responsibility to honor the terms 
of the gift and to keep accurate records of how you manage the gift.
You need to report on the statement of financial position or in the notes 
to the financial statements whether donors have imposed restrictions on 
contributions. Two types of restrictions are:
 
✓ Permanently restricted net assets: The donations in this category 
generally are used to provide a permanent source of income for your 
nonprofit. Some donors place conditions on their gifts that prohibit 
the sale of the contributed asset or that it can be used only for a certain 
purpose. Some gifts may require you to set up an endowment fund. 
An endowment is a transfer of money or property with a requirement 
that it be invested and the principal stays intact for a certain period 
of time.

263
 Chapter 16: Reporting Financial Condition on a Statement of Financial Position
 
✓ Temporary restricted net assets: These assets may have time or pur-
pose restrictions or both. For example, your donor may tell you that the 
asset can only be used to support a specific program, invested for a 
specified term, used at a designated future period, or used to acquire a 
long-term asset. If a donor gives a gift that has both time and purpose 
restrictions, it’s often referred to as a term endowment.
Your donors list is a good starting point to find these nest eggs. In the 
statement of financial position in Figure 16-1, you can see that OASIS Inc. 
has $12,500 in temporary restricted net assets.
 
Borrowing from restricted assets can cause you to lose the entire 
contribution.
Unrestricted net assets
Unrestricted net assets arise from gifts and other revenue that have no 
restrictions on their use, or from restricted gifts whose restrictions have 
been met. Unrestricted income is like gold. It has no pre-imposed terms and 
generally can be used immediately for anything you want. Some boards 
place self-imposed or board-designated endowments on themselves. This 
creates a class of unrestricted net assets called designated unrestricted net 
assets. Make sure the board designations are disclosed in the notes to the 
financial statements.
In the OASIS Inc. statement of financial position in Figure 16-1, you see total 
unrestricted net assets of $122,500.
 
If your nonprofit receives donated gifts with restrictions that limit their 
usage to long term, you can’t classify them with cash or other assets that are 
unrestricted. It’s important that you show available assets and those intended 
for future use and not mix the two. Normally the assets with use restrictions 
placed on them are reported in the long-term section of the statement of 
financial position with the heading assets restricted as to their use. The use 
descriptions should be disclosed in the notes (see Chapter 19). Readers of 
your nonprofit statement of financial position need to know what’s available 
to you and what’s not.
Total liabilities and net assets
To complete the statement, you need to add together the total liabilities and 
the total net assets. This number should match the number of the total 
assets line on the top half of your statement of financial position.
In Figure 16-1, OASIS Inc. has liabilities of $40,000 and net assets of $135,000. 
When you add the two figures together, you get $175,000, the exact same 
amount as the total assets. Success!

264
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Evaluating the Numbers
There is more to your statement of financial position than just the numbers 
or total amount of assets, liabilities, and net assets. Accountants take the 
numbers from this statement to evaluate how well you’re doing. You can do 
the same: Think of this evaluation of your nonprofit’s statement of financial 
position as a financial checkup.
 
You can get a sense of whether your organization is in good financial 
shape just by looking at the lines for total assets and total liabilities and 
net assets.
If the number on the top half (total assets) of the statement is less than the 
total liabilities number on the bottom half, you have a problem. How long 
your problem lasts, or if it worsens, depends on your nonprofit’s plans for 
the future. Some problems are only temporary. For example, you may have 
experienced unbudgeted increases in expenses. Maybe a water pipe burst 
and caused you to slip into a different position.
 
The statement of financial position is always referred to as of a given date 
because your financial condition is subject to change from day to day and by 
unplanned circumstances.
The statement of financial position reveals your organization’s ability to 
pay its bills. It also plays a part in determining what interest rate you pay 
when using credit cards or borrowing money. By analyzing current assets 
and current liabilities, you can figure out how much cash is on hand to 
pay liabilities. You can study your nonprofit’s financial position and get a 
crystal-clear picture of how your nonprofit is doing by using the statement of 
financial position to
 
✓ Compute working capital
 
✓ Analyze your debt-paying ability
Internal and external users of your balance sheet are interested in evaluating 
your financial health. Bankers, vendors, investors, donors, board members, 
constituents, accountants, and executive directors can easily evaluate your 
financial position by making a few simple computations. They look at your 
working capital and debt-to-equity ratio to determine whether to lend you 
money, issue credit cards, or charge higher interest rates.
This section shows you how to analyze your financial position and how to 
compute debt-paying ability and working capital.

265
 Chapter 16: Reporting Financial Condition on a Statement of Financial Position
Calculating working capital
Working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabili-
ties. Working capital indicates how much money you have available after 
paying your current liabilities and your ability to cover other obligations 
that may arise in the future. Creditors use working capital to determine 
interest rates.
 
To figure out your nonprofit’s working capital, you subtract the total current 
liabilities from the total current assets.
Take a look at Figure 16-1. The total current liabilities for the year are 
$40,000, and the total current assets are $171,000. Subtracting the total 
current liabilities from the total current assets gives you a working capital 
of $131,000 ($171,000 – $40,000 = $131,000).
 
Working capital is the amount you have left after you’ve paid your bills. If you 
have excess working capital, it means you can cover your current liabilities 
and have cash left over for other needs. Some may call working capital excess 
cash. Excess cash is like spare change.
Calculating a debt-to-equity ratio
Creditors use the numbers on your statement of financial position to 
determine what percentage of your total assets is used to pay your 
liabilities. One of the most commonly used ratios is the debt-to-equity 
ratio. A debt-to-equity ratio is total debts (liabilities) divided by total assets. 
This number shows the percentage of your nonprofit’s assets financed 
by debt. A high number signals that your nonprofit may not be able to pay 
its bills when they’re due. The higher the number, the more highly you are 
leveraged.
Looking at Figure 16-1, OASIS has a total of $175,000 in assets and a total of 
$40,000 in liabilities. To calculate the organization’s debt-to-equity ratio, 
you divide the total liabilities by the total assets. The math comes out to 
23 percent ($40,000 ÷ $175,000 = 0.23). This is a low debt-to-equity ratio.
 
Having a low debt-to-equity ratio is a good thing. Anything over 50 percent is 
considered risky.

Chapter 17
Eyeing the Cash Flow Statement
In This Chapter
▶ Growing with the cash flow
▶ Recognizing all activities
▶ Analyzing cash flow problems
T
he cash flow statement is one of the major financial statements required 
by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This statement 
basically reveals the inflow of cash to an organization and the outflow 
of cash from an organization. Cash inflows are cash receipts that come 
from operating, financing, and investing activities. Cash outflows are cash 
payments for operating, financing and investing activities.
The information found on the cash flow statement gives users an idea about 
your organization’s ability to generate positive future cash flows, its ability 
to pay debts, and a summary of sources (inflows) and uses (outflows) of 
cash. The cash flow statement is a better indicator of this than the statement 
of activities because the statement of activities reports transactions on 
the accrual basis not the cash basis. (See Chapter 15 for more about 
statements of activities.) In this chapter, I explain the importance of the 
cash flow statement, how it indicates a nonprofit’s ability to pay its debts, 
and how you can create it and use it to make decisions based on your need 
for available cash.
Seeing What the Cash Flow Statement 
Can Tell You about Your Nonprofit
The cash flow statement provides important information about your 
nonprofit. This statement answers questions about your nonprofit with 
information not found on other financial statements. It reveals how your 
organization’s growth and expansion were financed. It also identifies cash 
amounts from operations, selling and acquiring securities, purchasing and 
selling capital assets, and financing activities with creditors. Your cash flow 
statement can cover your monthly, quarterly, and annual cash inflows and 
outflows.

268
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Almost every transaction in an organization affects cash. Cash includes 
balances in your checking and savings accounts, as well as currency and 
coins. Cash equivalents include short-term investments that are quickly 
and easily turned into a known amount of cash and are so near to maturity 
that changes in interest rates won’t effect their value. Examples of these 
types of investments are treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market 
mutual funds.
 
You can improve your cash flow by keeping cash in an interest-bearing 
account or buying certificates of deposit.
Using the statement to see the big picture
The cash flow statement summarizes where your cash came from and where 
it went during the period. Donations of cash, checks, credit card contribu-
tions, money collected from fundraising, and grants received from all sources 
are considered cash inflows. Cash outflows are all purchases made with cash, 
payments for salaries and payroll taxes, and outlays paid with cash during 
the period.
To have a positive cash flow means that your inflow exceeds your outflow. 
One major problem most organizations have is the timing of the cash flow. 
Unfortunately, cash inflows (revenues) tend to lag behind outflows 
(expenses), creating a shortage of cash or a negative cash flow.
This statement also shows cash flow divided into categories. This is helpful 
to board members and other users because it breaks down cash inflows and 
outflows for the differing types of transactions. The statement of cash flow 
enables users to
 
✓ Understand how an organization obtains and uses cash
 
✓ Analyze the short-term viability of an organization; it reveals an 
organization’s liquidity or solvency
 
✓ Evaluate changes in statement of financial position accounts (assets, 
liabilities, and net assets; see Chapter 16 for more on these)
 
✓ Compare current information to prior statements
 
✓ More accurately predict amounts and timing of future cash flows
 
The cash flow statement does have some limitations. This report doesn’t tell 
the full story of your organization’s financial condition; it only explains how 
your cash balance has changed.

269
 Chapter 17: Eyeing the Cash Flow Statement
 
The cash flow statement differs from the statement of financial position and 
statement of activities because it shows the cash flows of activities during 
the reporting period. Another difference is that the statement uses the cash 
basis of accounting, meaning that transactions are recorded when cash is 
received or paid. Other financial statements reflect the accrual basis of 
accounting, whereby revenues are matched with expenses in the period 
earned or incurred, not when cash changes hands. (See Chapter 2 for more 
information about these two accounting methods.)
Making decisions based on the statement
You should use the cash flow statement along with the statement of financial 
position and statement of activities when making long-term financial deci-
sions for your nonprofit. Many believe the statement of financial position is 
the most important financial statement, but you can own millions in assets 
and have no cash to pay your current liabilities. The statement of activities 
may include restricted gifts that are outstanding, such as pledges to give. All 
financial statements indicate performance, and the cash flow statement is 
sometimes overlooked because many people don’t know how to use it.
Proper use of a cash flow statement can help you determine the following:
 
✓ If you need to borrow money
 
✓ When you can make major purchases
 
✓ When you need to consider downsizing
You know what happens when an organization can’t pay its debts. It defaults 
on creditors, borrows money, files for bankruptcy protection, or uses a 
combination of all three. You can use cash flow ratios to get an early warning 
about potential cash flow problems in your organizations. I explain two 
important ratios in the “Analyzing cash flow indicators” later in this chapter.
Understanding How to Create and 
Use a Cash Flow Statement
The cash flow statement is closely related to what happens in your organiza-
tion’s checkbook. To fully understand the cash flow statement, you must 
know the extent to which your organization relies on the cash it generates 
and the extent to which it relies on investments. You should view the cash 
flow statement alongside your nonprofit’s other financial statements (see the 
other chapters in Part IV for the statements to have) to get the total picture 
of your nonprofit’s financial standing.

270
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
The following sections identify the different parts of this statement and 
explain how to read it so you can fully understand your organization’s 
cash flow status. If you’re interested in creating your own cash flow 
statement, I provide you with some hands-on direction to get you started.
Getting the statement started
Before you can begin creating your organization’s cash flow statement, you 
need to have a battle plan. How do you plan on preparing the statement? You 
have two basic methods to choose from. Both methods classify and report 
cash receipts and payments from three activities: operating, investing, and 
financing activities. Both methods report cash flows from investing and 
financing activities in exactly the same manner, but they differ from how they 
report cash flows from operating activities:
 
✓ The direct method reports operating cash receipts and disbursements, 
such as cash received from donors or from providing services, and 
cash paid to employees or vendors. Cash receipts are what you have 
coming in; disbursements are what you have going out. The net total 
of these operating receipts and disbursements is net cash flow from 
operating activities. This method focuses on operating cash receipts and 
payments. Many believe knowing the sources of operating cash receipts 
and the reasons for making operating cash payments is more useful than 
just knowing the organization’s change in net assets. They also believe 
knowing operating cash receipts and disbursements from prior periods 
can help predict future operating cash flows. But the cash flow state-
ment is hard to prepare using this method if your books are kept on a 
running accrual basis. If you keep your books on the cash basis all year 
long and post accrual adjustments at the end of the year, using this 
method shouldn’t be too difficult. But books with transactions recorded 
on the accrual basis have to be adjusted to be reported on the cash 
basis. Your other choice of methods, the indirect method, adjusts 
accrual basis records to the cash basis.
 
✓ The indirect method begins with the change in net assets (net income, 
see Chapter 16 for more on net assets) and makes accrual to cash 
adjustments for revenues and expenses that didn’t arise from the 
receipt or payment of cash during the reporting period. This method 
focuses on the differences between changes in net assets (net income) 
and net cash flow from operating activities. Many users believe that the 
change in net assets, when adjusted to net cash flow from operating 
activities, is a more useful predictor of future cash flows than operating 
cash receipts and payments
 
GAAP encourages using the direct method, but it allows you to use either 
method. However, even if you choose to use the direct method, GAAP requires 
an additional disclosure reconciling the change in net assets to net cash flows 
from operating activities, which is what the indirect method does.

 Chapter 17: Eyeing the Cash Flow Statement
In practice, almost everybody uses the indirect method. For most organiza-
tions, the cash flow statement is easier to prepare using the indirect method. 
And if you use the direct method, you must use the indirect method to 
reconcile the change in net assets to net cash flow from operating activities. 
Finally, you don’t need the direct method to determine operating cash 
receipts and payments. You can usually determine specific operating cash 
flows by using information from the statement of financial position and 
statement of activities.
Identifying the parts of the statement
To completely grasp the cash flow statement and what it can tell you about 
your organization, you need to be able to identify its parts. The statement 
has three sections (see Figure 17-1):
 
✓ Cash flow from operating activities includes operating revenues received 
and operating expenses paid in cash. If it isn’t an investing or financing 
activity, its an operating activity.
 
✓ Cash flow from investing activities includes cash paid for acquiring and 
cash received from selling securities and/or assets.
 
✓ Cash flow from financing activities includes obtaining cash from 
creditors, repaying creditors, and receiving donations with long-term 
donor restrictions.

Doing the math
As Figure 17-1 shows, you use the cash flow amounts from three categories to 
determine your organization’s cash flow. You add the totals for each section 
to determine your organization’s increase or decrease in cash for that 
period. Here your organization has net cash provided by operating activities 
of $66,423, net cash used by investing activities of –$14,869, and net cash 
provided by financing activities of $3,790 to give you a net increase in cash 
of $55,344. Remember: Parentheses and dashes are negative numbers.
You also have a beginning cash balance from the previous period that you 
can use to see how your cash flow has changed over a longer period of time 
(the beginning cash balance for a period is actually the ending cash balance 
for the previous period). The difference between the beginning cash balance 
from the previous period and ending cash balance from the current period 
is the net increase or decrease in cash between the two periods.
 
The cash flow statement yields your organization’s change in cash, then the 
statement adds the change in cash to the organization’s cash balance at 
the beginning of the year (last year’s ending cash balance) to arrive at 
this year’s ending cash balance. This year’s ending cash balance should equal 
the cash balance in the current asset section of the organization’s statement 
of financial position. This is because the balances on the statement of 
financial position are end-of-year balances, so end-of-year cash on the state-
ment of financial position should equal end-of-year cash on the statement 
of cash flows.
If you report cash and cash equivalents on the statement of financial posi-
tion, then the statement of cash flows will show the change in cash and cash 
equivalents instead of just cash. The statement still yields the change in cash, 
but it adds the change to cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the 
year to get cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year.
The following sections break down these three parts and explain how you 
can use these numbers to your advantage.
Operating activities
The operating section of the cash flow statement reports how much money 
was collected from operating activities. Remember, if it isn’t financing or 
investing, then its operating. Nonprofits depend on gifts and contributions 
from individuals, corporations, foundations, and government entities. Some 
may generate revenue by charging a small fee for the services they provided, 
but for the most part, they rely heavily on fundraising activities to raise 
the necessary funds for operations. Check out the operating activities part of 
the cash flow statement in Figure 17-1. Note that all of the activity here is 
reported on the cash basis.

273
 Chapter 17: Eyeing the Cash Flow Statement
Your cash receipts and cash disbursements (payments) are recorded in your 
checkbook register. (Note: When I say cash, I’m talking about checks too.) 
Your checkbook register serves as a cash disbursements journal and a 
summary cash receipts journal. It’s a summary cash receipts journal because 
only the total cash deposited is recorded in your checkbook register. You 
keep the detail for your cash deposits in other registers called journals. You 
can have receipts journals for any kind of income, contributions, special 
events, grants, and so on. When you receive money, you post the receipt to a 
receipts journal. The total receipts recorded in the journal is posted to the 
cash account and related income account (double-entry accounting) in the 
general ledger. If you’re using accounting software, the program keeps these 
journals and does the posting for you.
At the end of each month, you should post the totals from your various 
cash receipts journals and your cash disbursements journal to the cash 
(and other) accounts in the general ledger. You summarize each journal by 
adding the columns, and then use that summary to develop entries to post to 
your general ledger. (For more about journals and ledgers, see Chapter 5.) 
The totals in Figure 17-1 would be taken from the activity posted to the 
cash account in the general ledger, and using the detail for this cash activity 
found in the cash receipts and cash disbursement journals, amounts are 
transferred to the cash flow statement. To get your net cash provided by 
operating activities, add your total receipts for operating activities and 
subtract your total disbursements for operating activities.
Investing activities
The investment section of the statement of cash flows reveals amounts 
used to sell or buy securities and to purchase and/or sell property, plant, 
or equipment. Take a look at the cash flow from investing activities in 
Figure 17-1. (Note: Endowments are transfers of money or donations of 
property with requirements that the investment principal remains intact.)
Reflected in this section is your investment of the gifts restricted for endow-
ment into your endowment fund. Also listed in this section are your 
purchases of fixed assets. If you had sold some fixed assets, then the 
proceeds would have been listed here as well. In our example, you received 
$12,506 in gifts restricted for investments in endowments (reported in 
the financing activities section) and you invested the $12,506 in term endow-
ments (reported in the investing activities section). You also used $2,363 to 
purchase fixed assets yielding$14,869of net cash used by investing activities. 
Remember, you get this detailed information from the receipts and disburse-
ment journals that make up the total amounts posted to the cash account in 
the general ledger.
Financing activities
Financing activities are essentially borrowing money, repaying the debt, and 
receiving gifts with long-term donor imposed restrictions. Typical long-term 
credit instruments are mortgages and notes payable. When you borrow 

274
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
money, you receive cash from financing activities, and when you make loan 
payments you use cash for investing activities. Typical gifts with long-term 
restrictions are contributions for long-term endowment funds. 
You find these amounts in your activity posted to your debt accounts in 
the general ledger. These numbers were first recorded in your cash disburse-
ment journal (also known as your checkbook journal), and then posted 
to the cash, debt, and interest expense accounts (remember double-entry 
accounting) in the general ledger. Take the total amounts posted to the 
debt accounts in the general ledger and transfer them to the statement of 
cash flows.
Check out the financing activities section in Figure 17-1. The amounts in 
this section of the cash flow statement reflect principal payments on the 
organization’s mortgage and the total received from donors’ gifts restricted 
for endowments. (Your restriction is to use the proceeds from the invest-
ment and not to touch the principal.) In this example the organization 
repaid $8,716 of principal on its mortgage, and received gifts restricted for 
endowment of $12,506, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities 
of $3,790. If you had borrowed some money, you would have reported the 
amount of cash received here as well.
One last thing, if you take out a loan to buy some long-term asset and you 
never receive the cash (think mortgage loan), this transaction will not appear 
on your cash flow statement because you didn’t receive or disburse any 
cash. However, this non-cash financing activity must be disclosed in your 
financial statement notes (see Chapter 19).
Analyzing Cash Flow Indicators
Cash flow ratios are used to evaluate an organization’s ability to pay its 
current liabilities given its current assets. Knowing this number tells you 
how likely it is that your organization can continue to support itself.
 
If you’re experiencing problems meeting your current obligations, you need 
to call an emergency board meeting. Your board can help you remedy this 
problem. Some cash flow problems are temporary and can be resolved with a 
short-term loan. If you think your cash flow problems are more significant, you 
may want to hire a CPA to help you foresee future cash flow problems.
Although you can calculate several ratios from the cash flow statement, for 
this discussion, I focus on two of the most important indicators: operating 
cash flow ratio and free cash flow. The following sections take a closer look 
at them.

275
 Chapter 17: Eyeing the Cash Flow Statement
 
Financial ratios are only meaningful if a reference point is used. You should 
compare them to historical values and similar organizations. Ratios should be 
viewed as indicators, and some are limited by different accounting methods.
Calculating the operating cash flow ratio
The operating cash flow (OCF) ratio evaluates whether an organization is 
generating enough cash to meet its short-term obligations.
To calculate the OCF ratio, grab your statement of financial position (see 
Chapter 16) to get the total current liabilities at the end of the period. Then 
you divide the net cash flow from operating activities (taken from your cash 
flow statement) by the current liabilities. Here’s the equation:
Operating cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities ÷ 
Current liabilities
For example, Figure 17-1 shows net cash flow from operating activities of 
$66,423; the total current liabilities is $40,000 (taken from Figure 16-1 in 
Chapter 16). Dividing $66,423 by $40,000 equals 1.6606. This number is the 
operating cash flow ratio for OASIS Inc.
 
When you calculate a ratio, you measure performance. This result indicates 
whether an organization can sustain itself. As a general rule, a ratio below 1.0 
indicates potential problems with paying short-term debt. It signals a need to 
hold a fundraiser, sell some stock, slow down on spending, tap into your 
reserves, or borrow money. Any ratio above 1.00 is considered safe for most 
organizations.
Determining free cash flow
Free cash flow (FCF) tells you how much money you have after paying 
your bills, including paying for investments in capital assets. I consider this 
spare change.
 
To calculate free cash flow, you need to grab your cash flow statement (see 
Figure 17-1). You subtract cash used for purchases of fixed assets (its in 
the investing activities section) from net cash flow from operating activities 
(in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement). Here’s the 
equation:
Free cash flow = Net cash flow from operating activities – cash used for 
purchases of fixed assets.

276
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
For example, net cash flow from operating activities is $66,423 and cash used 
for purchases of fixed assets is $2,363. So you subtract $2,363 from $66,423, 
which equals $64,060.
Many organization’s include debt payments made for loans that were taken 
out to buy fixed assets. If you do this with this example, you also subtract 
the cash used by principal payments on mortgage (it’s in the financing 
activities section of the statement of cash flows). This is the amount of cash 
you have after paying all of your operating expenses and your payments 
for fixed assets. This cash is available for paying other debt and any other 
investments or expenditures the organization wishes to make. So, for this 
example, you subtract $2,363 and $8,716 from $66,423, which equals $55,344. 
This number is excellent. Based on the information provided, OASIS Inc. is 
stable and has sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as of the end 
of the year.
The lower your amount of free cash flow, the less money you have to pay for 
other debts and other nonoperating activities. If it’s zero or negative, you 
might have cash flow problems! Free cash flow indicates amounts of cash 
available for expansion of programs, facilities, or endowments. Obviously 
more is better. 

Chapter 18
Organizing the Statement 
of Functional Expense
In This Chapter
▶ Allocating expenses by function
▶ Analyzing spending and efficiency
Your statement of functional expense reveals by line item and category 
how much you’ve spent for the different categories of expenses 
reported on the statement of activities — program costs, management and 
general expenses, and fundraising expenses. Basically, this statement is an 
itemized list providing detailed information about the expenses reported on 
the statement of activities. Overall, it measures your organization’s efficiency 
in fulfilling its mission; it shows how well you’ve used your funds for their 
intended purposes.
Right now, the folks who make up the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants (AICPA) are having lengthy discussions about the need for 
providing a statement of functional expenses. Presently it’s only required 
for certain organizations (voluntary health and welfare groups), but all 
nonprofits are encouraged to create one. Knowing how much it costs to run 
your organization and to put on fundraising events is valuable information 
to have.
In this chapter, I look at how expenses are divided by function into three 
categories and how to use the numbers to measure efficiency.
Classifying Functional Expense
Your challenges as a nonprofit executive director or manager are to address 
the needs of your constituents, pay your organization staff, and keep 
administrative costs down, all while running effective programs. To do 
so, you can rely on the statement of functional expense. To fully use this 
statement, you need to know how to classify your organization’s expenses.

278
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
You classify expenses according to function to measure how well you’re 
doing. In other words, you’re figuring out how much of the donors’ money is 
used to run programs versus being spent on other things. Your statement of 
functional expense breaks down all organization costs by function into three 
main categories:
 
✓ Program expenses
 
✓ Management and general expenses
 
✓ Fundraising expenses
Sometimes a fourth category, membership development, is reported. This 
category is used by some larger membership organizations, but most 
organizations report membership development with their fundraising costs.
 
Doing the statement of functional expense is a simple task. Take a look at 
the statement of activities in Chapter 15. See how the expenses are broken 
down by program, management and general, and fundraising expenses? 
If you prepare your statement of activities in this manner, you’ve already done 
your statement of functional expense (see Figure 18-1).
Keeping track of time
Allocating time and matching it with the correct programs aren’t mere 
suggestions when it comes to federal grant programs. It’s required that 
all employees who are paid from grant funds document their time and 
attendance. If your nonprofit receives any grant money, you’re required to 
use this statement to record in detail your time expense.
One way to track and allocate employee expense among the categories is by 
keeping track of how much time is spent doing what. If you make a habit of 
writing down how you spend your time every day, it removes the guesswork.
If you’re like most nonprofits, your agency has three types of workers:
 
✓ Employees who are ineligible for overtime pay (paid on salary)
 
✓ Employees eligible for overtime pay (paid hourly)
 
✓ Unpaid volunteers
 
The best way to properly allocate expenses is to have staff and volunteers fill 
out time and attendance reports (T&A reports) that indicate which program to 
charge. Time and attendance reports are also called time sheets. They indicate 
how an employee spent her time. Time sheets also reflect which program or 
fund will pay the employee’s salary.

You should ask each employee to keep a log of how she spends each hour of 
her workday. She should also record time off for holidays, weekends, sick 
days, and vacation time. The time and attendance report should be filled 
out to coincide with your nonprofit’s pay period, signed, and dated by the 
employee. Then you or the employee’s supervisor should review, sign, and 
date the report as verification of the employee’s time. This report can be 
used to allocate the employee’s personnel expenses to the various functional 
categories.

280
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Keeping time and attendance reports yields the following benefits:
 
✓ Helps settle disputes about an employee’s pay
 
✓ Creates a paper trail for auditors
 
✓ Verifies how federal dollars are spent
 
✓ Provides a way for management to keep up with employee costs
 
✓ Provides a basis for allocating personnel costs to functional categories
 
Time and attendance reports are mandatory for employees paid out of federal 
grants. Federal grants program managers require these reports because they 
give accountability and add credibility to how the money has been used. Plus, 
signed time and attendance reports provide documentation for audit use.
 
Keep completed time and attendance reports with your grant files. Program 
managers may ask to see them during a monitoring visit or audit. The 
timesheet in Figure 18-2 displays how to document and track your and your 
employees’ time.

You can also ask volunteers to fill out a time and attendance report. If a 
volunteer donates professional services (such as legal or accounting services) 
that your nonprofit would otherwise have to pay for, you can account for 
the volunteer’s time as an in-kind donation.
Allocating expenses
The expenses listed on your statement of functional expense are ordinary, 
day-to-day expenses and cover a wide variety of expenses, including, but not 
limited to, advertising, awards, conference registration, credit card fees, 
equipment, marketing, and so on. Any of the many expenses your nonprofit 
incurs may be charged to program costs, management and general costs, 
and/or fundraising costs. You just need to make that determination.
 
Your list of expenses may be different than another nonprofit’s because each 
organization is unique, but overall, every bill paid should be allocated to one 
of the three categories. Of course, some expenses benefit all three categories. 
Some may only be charged to one or two. When expenses apply to more than 
one category, your bookkeeper can allocate an equal share of expenses to the 
appropriate categories. Some expenses, such as marketing, may be split 
equally, especially if you’re advertising all the programs and services offered 
by your nonprofit.
 
Some high-tech devices, such as copiers or printers, can allocate expenses 
based on actual usage. For example, you can have your copier or printer set 
up to assign codes to each program and person. Then, each time something 
is photocopied or printed, the copier or printer matches the expense to the 
program or person. So when you’re making copies of a fundraising event flyer, 
your copier can assign the cost of printing to fundraising expense.
To help you have a clearer grasp of the three main types of functional 
expenses, the following sections break them down and help you differentiate 
between them so you know how to classify them on your statement of 
functional expense.
Program expenses
Your programs are used to implement your mission. Program expenses are 
the costs of goods and services used to fulfill your purpose and to operate 
your projects. Some common programs are
 
✓ Food pantries and soup kitchens
 
✓ Mentoring programs

282
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
 
✓ Tutoring programs
 
✓ Support groups
Of course many programs benefit people, so these are just a few examples. 
Program expenses are expenses directly related to a program. Common 
program expenses are
 
✓ Supplies
 
✓ Wages of people working solely or directly for a program
 
✓ Personnel costs related to the program’s direct employees
 
The total program expense on the statement of functional expense should 
equal the program expense reported on the statement of activities. The totals 
for administrative and fundraising expenses should also agree with those 
amounts reported on the statement of activities.
If an expense is incurred by two or more programs, you can divide it equally 
by the programs that benefited. For example, consider the cost of labor 
(salaries, payroll taxes, and fringe benefits). This is usually a high expense for 
nonprofits. By using time and attendance reports, you can divide the expense 
up by the hours spent working on each program (see the “Keeping track of 
time” section earlier in the chapter).
Management and general expenses
The second classification of expenses on the statement of functional expense 
is management and general expenses (M&G). These costs aren’t identifiable to 
any program, fundraising, or membership development activity. That is, they 
aren’t directly related to an activity nor are they reasonably allocable to an 
activity. These expenses represent costs that are shared by all activities and 
are necessary for the organization’s operation. Some expenses are general 
overhead costs of operations like rent and utilities. These costs provide an 
indirect benefit to your organization as a whole, and you incur them whether 
you run one or three programs.
Management and general activities include
 
✓ Accounting staff
 
✓ Business management
 
✓ Insurance
 
✓ Legal expenses
 
✓ Payroll taxes
 
✓ Rent/Mortgage
 
✓ Salaries

283
 Chapter 18: Organizing the Statement of Functional Expense
 
✓ Travel
 
✓ Utilities
 
✓ Administrative activities of the organization as a whole
For example, you use the phone in your office for day-to-day business. You 
wouldn’t go out and buy a new phone just to operate a new program and to 
keep expenses separate. You use the phone you have to make the calls 
needed about the new program, and you allocate a portion of the phone bill 
to all programs that benefit from its use.
You may be allowed to charge a portion of your M&G to your grants. If you 
have programs funded by government grants, you may have an allowance 
for administrative expenses of 5 percent or more that can be allocated to 
the grant. If you have an indirect cost rate (a rate given to government grant 
recipients for running grant programs), you have an acceptable rate already 
computed for you. (For more on indirect cost rates, see Chapter 10.)
Your T&A reports are the best way to allocate expenses for salaries and 
fringe benefits to the right category. Finally, your operating budget separates 
program costs from M&G and fundraising costs. See Chapter 8 for more 
about operating budgets.
 
If you can’t identify the cost as a program or fundraising cost, then it’s auto-
matically a M&G cost. Make sure the total M&G on the statement of functional 
expense matches the M&G amount on the statement of activities.
Fundraising expenses
The third group of expenses on the statement of functional expense is for 
fundraising. You’re fully aware of how important fundraising is to your 
organization. You seek philanthropists who will donate money, goods, 
services, time, and effort to support your cause with no quid pro quo. 
Keeping track of the expenses related to fundraising is important to help 
you determine whether your efforts at raising money are working and 
whether you’re spending money in the right areas.
Fundraising activities include
 
✓ Advertising and direct mail campaigns
 
✓ Maintaining donor mailing lists
 
✓ Conducting fundraising events, including dinners and dances, concerts 
and fashion shows, sporting competitions, and auctions
 
✓ Preparing and handing out fundraising materials
 
✓ Conducting other activities involved with soliciting contributions from 
individuals, organizations, foundations, corporations, and government

Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
The cost of all activities that create support for your nonprofit in the form 
of gifts, grants, contributions, and services are considered fundraising 
expenses. Some fundraising expenses stand out. For example, the cost of a 
direct mail campaign is easy to allocate to fundraising expenses because you 
know how much postage was used, how many envelopes were mailed, and 
how many copies you printed.
 
Many of the fundraising activities held by some nonprofits aren’t considered 
fundraising events by the IRS. According to the IRS, fundraising events don’t 
include
 
✓ Sales of gifts or goods or services unless they’re of nominal value 
(nominal value is less than real or market value)
 
✓ Sweepstakes, lotteries, or raffles where the names of contributors or 
other respondents are entered in a drawing for prizes
 
✓ Raffles or lotteries where prizes have only nominal value
 
✓ Solicitation campaigns that generate only contributions
If need be, check with your accountant to verify you’re classifying the 
expenses correctly.
 
A new method is emerging to conduct fundraising campaigns over the 
Internet. This new wave is called ePhilanthropy, and it allows you to solicit 
funds from your Web site, even while you’re sleeping.
Using the Statement of Functional 
Expense to Calculate Ratios
Potential donors typically like to give money to organizations where they 
know their money is being spent wisely. They sometimes calculate how 
much of your total expenses are used for programs versus how much is used 
for management and general expenses. Face it: No one wants to give to 
an organization and have his gift squandered. You can use the statement 
of functional expense to show your donors exactly how your nonprofit is 
spending its money and that you’re using your donations to help the people 
you’re trying to reach.
To show how you use your funding, you can calculate different ratios that 
provide insight into your organization’s operating performance and financial 
position. You calculate ratios to measure your nonprofit’s organizational 
efficiency. The total expenses alone don’t give a clear picture of your 
efficiency, but calculating ratios gives the numbers more meaning. (To 
calculate a ratio, you divide one number by another number. Ratios indicate 
the relationship of one thing to another.)

285
 Chapter 18: Organizing the Statement of Functional Expense
 
Ratios are only as good as the numbers used to calculate them, so make sure 
the figures on your statement of functional expense are accurate.
By figuring the ratios in the following sections, you can show that your 
donors’ contributions aren’t being used to pay high salaries and other 
extravagant expenses. You can ideally advertise that your nonprofit has 
low administrative and fundraising costs. As a general rule, you want 
to keep your administrative and fundraising costs down and spend donations 
on their intended purpose of running programs.
Program spending ratio
The program spending ratio tells you what percentage of your total spending 
goes toward programs. Having your program expenses broken down by 
percentages gives the statement of functional expense more meaning. 
It allows people to get a quick overview of how much of their donations 
support programs.
To calculate the program spending ratio, you divide total program expenses 
by total expenses. Refer to Figure 18-1 to see the two categories for program 
expense, mentoring and tutoring, for this example.
The total allocated to the mentoring program is $154,000. The total program 
expense for the tutoring program is $92,500. The total program expense is 
$246,500.
The total expenses for the year are $315,000. The program spending ratio is 
78 percent ($246,500 ÷ $315,000 = 0.78). This means that 78 percent of your 
total expenses are used to run programs.
Overall you’re better off with a high program spending ratio because donors 
want to fund programs, not the administrative and fundraising costs to 
operate your nonprofit. If the percentages in this example were the other way 
around, you probably wouldn’t get too many donations if only 22 percent of 
the total expenses supported programs. Of course, sometimes there’s room 
for exceptions. If you’re renovating or upgrading your building, you’ll have 
something to show for the disparity.
Fundraising efficiency ratio
The fundraising efficiency ratio tells what percentage of dollars were spent 
to raise another dollar. Nonprofit managers have a challenging job to raise 
capital while keeping costs down. This ratio is important because donors like 
their money to go directly to the programs they’re supporting.

286
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
You divide fundraising costs by total contributions to get your fundraising 
efficiency ratio. (You need to refer to your statement of activities to get 
the total contributions for the year; see Chapter 15 for more on the statement 
of activities.) To calculate the fundraising efficiency ratio, consider the 
following hypothetical scenario.
If you received $425,000 in contributions and your fundraising costs were 
$13,500, your fundraising efficiency ratio is 3 percent ($13,500 ÷ $425,000 = 
0.03). It only costs 3 cents to raise a dollar.
A 3 percent fundraising efficiency ratio is considered a good ratio because it 
shows that you’re keeping fundraising costs down. A bad ratio depends on 
what your board and stakeholders expect from you. Larger organizations can 
have a higher ratio, but small nonprofits should strive to keep this number as 
low as possible.

Closing the Nonprofit Books
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing why you need to close the books
▶ Completing year-end entries
▶ Including notes with your financial statements
A
s you come to the end of your fiscal year, you need to wrap up your 
books for previous 12 months and start the books for the next year. 
Your fiscal year may be on a calendar year from January to December 
or some other 12-month period. No matter when your fiscal year ends, you 
need to close your books and start a new accounting cycle or year. To do 
so, you have to make some closing entries to certain accounts. Closing 
your books is an important process because you need to transfer the balance 
from statement of activities accounts to another account, so that only 
statement of financial position accounts remain open.
When you close your books, you need to make sure all of your temporary 
accounts, such as your revenue and expense accounts, have zero balances so 
revenues and expenses in the next accounting cycle can be properly 
recorded and closed.
This chapter discusses how to close the temporary accounts (revenue 
and expense), how to make some of the necessary notes to your financial 
statements, how to do reversing entries, how to make the necessary 
adjustments to your accounts, and how to prepare your books for the next 
accounting period.
 
If you’re using a manual system, closing the books may turn out to be a little 
more work than if you were using accounting software because computerized 
systems close the accounts for you. Regardless of which system you use, 
you need to understand the procedures to end one accounting period and 
begin another.

288
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Understanding the Need to Close 
Your Nonprofit’s Books
During the course of the year, you’ve had money coming in (revenues) and 
money going out (expenses). This is a continuous cycle that will always take 
place in your organization. At the end of your fiscal year, you have completed 
an accounting period and need to close the year.
 
You close the books to determine your nonprofit’s income or losses for the 
year. If you don’t close your books, you have no ending to your accounting 
period. Without closed books you have no new beginning. Your accounting 
period had a beginning date and an ending date. At the end of the account-
ing period, you tab up the totals and prepare financial statements and then 
move onto the next accounting period.
After your books are adjusted, you can prepare your trial balance and 
then your financial statements. At this point you can also close your books. 
After your financial statements are done, you turn your information over to 
a CPA for an independent audit. But you can’t prepare accurate financial 
statements until your books are adjusted, and you can’t start a new account-
ing period until your books are closed.
To understand how to close the books, you have to know the difference 
between temporary and permanent accounts:
 
✓ Temporary accounts: Revenue and expense accounts are considered 
temporary accounts. They increase as the year progresses. These 
accounts are ones you close out at the end of the accounting cycle. The 
closing process resets these accounts to zero so that only increases for 
the current accounting period are accumulated in the accounts.
 
 You find these accounts in the general ledger; they’re reported on the 
statement of activities (also called the income statement; see Chapter 15 
for more about this statement). They include all revenue you received 
and every bill you paid for that year. These accounts record your 
organization’s income and expenses.
 
✓ Permanent accounts: These accounts are also found in the general 
ledger and reported on the statement of financial position (also called 
the balance sheet; see Chapter 16 for more about this statement). 
They carry over from year to year, so you don’t need to worry about 
closing these accounts. But, you do close your temporary accounts 
to a permanent account.

289
 Chapter 19: Closing the Nonprofit Books
When you close the books, you transfer the balances of your revenue and 
expense accounts to an income summary account. (I explain the particular 
steps of closing out the books in the following section.) Remember, the 
balances for all your accounts; revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and 
equity are in you general ledger. An income summary account records the 
closing of expense and revenue accounts for a given period (12 months, in 
the case of closing the books at the end of the fiscal year).
The income summary account is closed to a statement of financial position 
account called net assets. The net assets account as shown on your statement 
of financial position is the net assets at the end of year from your statement 
of financial activities. The difference between total revenues and total 
expenses gives an increase or decrease in net assets. The net assets at the 
beginning of the year is added to the increase (decrease) in net assets to give 
the net assets at end of year. The statement of financial position shows the 
net assets at the end of year as net assets. The purpose of closing entries is 
to transfer revenues and expenses to the net asset account.
Closing entries accomplishes two things:
 
✓ It causes all expense and revenue accounts to begin the new 
accounting period with zero balances. Each accounting cycle needs 
to show performances that took place only during that period. 
Revenue and expense accounts are only used temporarily to store 
your accounting activities. After the accounting period ends, you 
transfer the results of everything that transpired during that cycle to 
the income summary account.
 
✓ It transfers the net effect of the past period’s revenue and expense 
transactions to an equity account. During your accounting cycle you 
made purchases, you received support and revenue, and you paid bills. 
Now that this accounting period has expired, you only need to reflect 
the effect of the activities that happened in it. So by closing revenue 
and expense accounts to the income summary, the income summary 
reflects the net effects of your revenues and expenses. This net effect 
is transferred to an equity account by closing the income summary to 
net assets.
Adjusting, Closing and Reversing Entries
During your year-end closing process, you’ll probably need to adjust some of 
your accounts to correct some balances and make cash to accrual adjust-
ments. After you’ve made your adjusting entries, you can prepare an adjusted 

290
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
trial balance which you’ll use to prepare your financial statements. Then you 
need to make closing entries to close your income and expense accounts to 
the income summary, and close the income summary to net assets. Finally, 
at the beginning of the next accounting period, you may want to reverse 
some of the cash to accrual adjustments you made at the end of the previous 
accounting period.
The following sections walks you through the actual closing process 
including when you may have to reverse and adjust some entries at 
year end.
Adjusting entries: Year-end
Adjusting entries are necessary to end the reporting period and to record 
unrecognized revenues and expenses incurred during the accounting period. 
When a transaction begins in one accounting period and ends in a later 
one, adjusting entries are required. Also, adjusting entries are done to make 
corrections due to mistakes made during the year. These type of adjusting 
entries are also called correcting entries.
Adjusting entries are journal entries that are recorded in a journal called the 
general journal. You post these entries in chronological order. The general 
journal is where you post various entries for events that affect accounts but 
aren’t part of the normal transaction process or are somehow special or 
unusual. Examples are closing entries, correcting entries, and other adjusting 
entries,
Certain accounts require adjustments at the end of your accounting period 
due to their nature, like prepaid expenses. Certain things like differing 
bases of accounting and time-period concepts will require account adjust-
ments. Prepaid expenses are assets until they’re used in the operation of 
your organization. Things such as subscriptions to journals or magazines, 
insurance, and so on are considered prepaid expenses.
Using different bases of accounting may require adjustments if you’ve kept 
your books on the cash basis throughout the year because your financial 
statements must be presented on the accrual basis according to generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The cash basis reports revenues and 
expenses when they’re received or paid. GAAP require assigning revenues 
to the periods in which they’re earned and expenses to the period in which 
they are incurred. Adjusting entries can be made to make cash to accrual 
adjustments.

291
 Chapter 19: Closing the Nonprofit Books
When accounts like payroll overlap accounting periods, they require special 
consideration. The entire adjustment process is based on revenues being 
recognized in the accounting period in which they are earned and expenses 
recognized in the period they were incurred.
Say the mortgage payable balance in your general ledger is $4,900 and your 
interest expense is $900. But your notice from the bank says your mortgage 
balance is $5,000 and the interest you paid for the year was $1,000. You would 
make the following entry to correct (adjust) the balances in your general ledger 
(to increase an expense you debit it and to increase a liability you credit it): 
  
To adjust mortgage payable and interest expense to bank’s records.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Interest expense
 
Mortgage payable
100
100
Or suppose you get paid every two weeks but the end of the year falls right in 
the middle of the two-week period. Wages for the first week were $2,000. 
Accrual accounting requires you to recognize the payroll expense when it 
was incurred, not when it is paid. So to post an adjustment:
  
To accrue the last week’s wages for 20XX.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Wages expense
 
Wages payable
2,000
2,000
Here’s an example for a cash to accrual adjustment. Assume there is a zero 
balance in accounts payable at the end of the year. However, in early 
January, you receive a $50 telephone bill for the month of December, which 
you pay in January. The expense was incurred in December, so the accrual 
basis of accounting requires you to recognize the expense in December not 
January. To do this you post the following entry:
  
To post accounts payable at 12/31/XX
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Telephone expense
 
Accounts payable
50
50

292
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
When you record the payment in January, you either debit accounts payable 
in your cash disbursements journal or debit telephone expense if you 
reversed the cash to accrual adjustment at the beginning of the year. I talk 
about reversing entries later in this chapter. 
To make the adjustments, at the end of each accounting period or year, you 
prepare a worksheet called a Working Trial Balance. This worksheet allows 
you to see what will appear on your financial statements. Follow these steps:
 
1. Begin your working trial balance with your unadjusted trial balance.
 
 This is the listing of your account balances in the general ledger before 
you have posted your year-end adjustments to these accounts (first two 
columns). 
 
2. Post your adjustments to the accounts (third and fourth columns) and 
list your adjusted trial balance (columns five and six), which is your 
unadjusted account balances with your adjusting entries taken into 
account.
 
 The account balances in your adjusted trial balance should equal the 
balances in the general ledger once you have posted your adjustments 
to the general ledger. Figure 19-1 shows an example.

 Chapter 19: Closing the Nonprofit Books
After all adjustments are made to your books, you should do an adjusted trial 
balance to verify that everything balances. Your adjusted trial balance is the 
difference between the unadjusted trial balance and your trial balance after 
adjustments. Take a look at Figure 19-1 to see how the adjusted trial balance 
helps you complete your financial statements.
When your trial balance is balanced, you can complete your financial 
statements. All you have to do is move the information from your worksheet 
into the correct categories on your financial statements. Check out the 
chapters in Part IV to help you put together the different financial statements 
you need. Now all you have to do to finish closing out your year is post your 
closing entries.
Closing entries: A 1-2-3 step
To close out your accounting period, you need to make three important 
closing entries: one for expenses, one for revenues, and a final one for the 
income summary. You can’t do the income summary without the other 
two. The steps are as follows:
 
1. Close expense accounts.
 
 Your expense accounts are found in your general ledger, each one 
has to be reset to zero. To close an expense account, you need to 
decrease it or zero it out by doing a credit (Remember: Expense 
accounts have a normal balance of a debit.) Expense accounts are 
closed by credits equal to the total account’s debit balance. To close, 
you write a closing entry in the general journal listing all the expense 
accounts such as this:
 
 
To close expense accounts to the income summary.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Income summary
 
Telephone expense
 
Supplies expense
 
(Keep listing expenses)
WW
XX
YY
ZZ
 
 Note in this example the total of all the credits to the expense accounts 
equals the debit to the income summary. So for this example, XX + YY + 
ZZ = WW. Closing the expense accounts transfers the total of expenses 
to the income summary.

294
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
 
2. Close revenue accounts.
 
 Your revenue accounts are also found in the general ledger and you 
have to reset each one of them to zero. To close a revenue account, you 
need to decrease it or zero it out by doing a debit. Revenue accounts 
have a normal balance of a credit, so you close it out by making a debit 
equal to the account’s credit balance. To close a revenue account, follow 
this example:
 
 
To close expense accounts to the income summary.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Contributions
Program fee income
(Keep listing revenues)
 
Income summary
WW
XX
YY
ZZ
 
 In this example the total of all the debits to the revenue accounts equals 
the credit to the income summary. So for this example, WW + XX + YY = 
ZZ. Closing the revenue accounts transfers the total of revenues to the 
income summary.
 
3. Close the income summary account.
 
 Your income summary account is a temporary account in the general 
ledger set up to close the revenue and expense accounts. The balance in 
the income summary equals the total expenses (debits) posted to the 
account in step one netted against the total revenues (credits) posted to 
the account in step two. If the income summary has a credit balance, 
then you had a surplus (increase in net assets) for the year. If it has a 
debit balance, then you had a deficit (decrease in net assets) for the 
year. So the last step is to transfer the balance from the income sum-
mary to net assets by closing the income summary to net assets. The 
entry looks something like this:
 
 
To close the income summary.
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Income summary
 
Net assets
XX
XX
 
 Notice in this example there was a surplus for the year because I had 
to debit the income summary to close it. If I had to debit the income 
summary to close it, then there was a credit balance in the income 

295
 Chapter 19: Closing the Nonprofit Books
summary, which means revenues exceeded expenses. If in this scenario, 
the debits had exceeded the credits, a deficit would have resulted, 
showing that expenses were more than revenues.
 
 The income summary account is closed to your net assets account on 
your statement of financial position.
Reversing entries to close 
temporary accounts
Some accounts tend to overlap the accounting period. For instance, if 
your accounting period ends December 31 and payroll isn’t paid for 
this period until January 15, the money employees receive in January 
is for work performed in December. This is considered an overlap, and 
adjustments need to be made at year-end to make sure salaries are 
charged to the right year.
If you keep your books on the cash basis during the year and make cash to 
accrual adjustments at the end of the year for your financial statements, you 
need to reverse those cash to accrual adjustments (the overlapping revenue 
or expense adjustment) at the beginning of the next year. If you don’t, then 
you’ll count the overlapping revenue or expenses twice: once in the period 
you made the cash to accrual adjustment (placed the transaction in the 
right period), and again in the next period when you receive the accrued 
revenue or pay the accrued expenses. Reversing the accrual entry subtracts 
the revenue or expense that was accrued and recognized in the previous 
period and it eliminates the amount accrued to the related asset or liability 
account on your statement of financial position
A reversing entry is easy, you record it in the general journal. You debit 
what was credited and you credit what was debited in your year-end cash 
to accrual adjustment. Remember the example for an adjusting entry for 
December’s $50 telephone bill received and paid for in January? Well we 
moved the expense from January into December by making the following 
adjusting entry:
  
To post accounts payable at 12/31/XX
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Dec 31
Telephone expense
 
Accounts payable
50
50

296
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
I moved the expense into from one period into another. If you run your 
books on the cash basis in January and don’t make any reversing entries, 
you recognize $50 of telephone expense when you pay December’s phone 
bill in January. You’d end up counting it twice, once in December and 
once in January. You’ll also still show $50 in accounts payable even though 
the bill has been paid. That’s because accounts payable is found on the 
statement of financial position and is a permanent account; it is not reset 
to zero at year end. So to prevent all this from happening you post a 
reversing entry:
  
To reverse previous year’s telephone accrual
Date
Debit
Credit
20XX
Jan 1
Accounts payable
 
Telephone expense
50
50
See how the accounts payable balance has been eliminated? A $50 debit 
netted against a $50 credit equals zero. But what about telephone expense? 
Expenses are temporary accounts that are closed to zero at the end of the 
year so where is the $50 debit to offset the $50 credit of the reversing entry 
going to come from? It comes from your cash disbursements journal when 
you pay the $50 phone bill in January.
So you reverse all of the previous year-end’s cash to accrual adjustments. 
Don’t reverse all of the adjustments. Some adjustments correct balances 
and shouldn’t be changed. Some expenses, like depreciation, aren’t paid 
with cash, and so those entries wouldn’t be reversed. But entries that 
move income or expenses from one period to another need to be reversed 
if you run your books on the cash basis and make year-end accrual 
adjustments.
Completing the Notes to the 
Financial Statements
The notes (also referred to as footnotes) to your financial statements provide 
additional valuable information about your financial picture that can 
influence the overall judgment about your organization’s future. According 
to generally acceptable accounting practices (GAAP), all financial statements 
should contain notes of disclosure (see Figure 19-2 for an example).

OASIS, Inc
Notes To Financial Statements
December 31, 2010
NOTE 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Organization 
 
The OASIS, Inc is a nonprofit organization established under Section  
 
501 (C) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The OASIS’ purpose is to  
 
mentor and tutor middle school children by providing a positive adult  
 
role model. The Organization conducts its own programs of  
 
 
mentoring and tutoring within the public school system. 
 
Basis of Accounting 
 
The accompanying financial statements are presented using the  
 
accrual method of  accounting.
 
Information regarding the financial position and activities are classified  
 
into the applicable classes of net assets: unrestricted net assets, and  
 
temporarily restricted net assets.
 
Unrestricted net assets – these are net assets without donor-imposed  
 
stipulations. 
 
Temporarily restricted net assets – net assets that may or may not be  
 
met by actions of OASIS and/or the passage of time. 
 
In addition, expenses are classified into mentoring and tutoring  
 
program service expenses, management and general and fundraising  
 
expenses.
 
Certain funds have been designated by the Board of Directors for  
 
specified purposes. These funds have appropriately been included in  
 
the unrestricted net asset classification. 
 
*Currently, OASIS does not have any assets that are permanently  
 
restricted.
 
Accounting Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally  
 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make  
 
estimates and assumption that affect the reported amounts of assets  
 
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the  
 
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues  
 
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ  
 
from those estimates.
 
Fixed Assets 
 
Fixed assets are recorded at cost or estimated fair market values at the  
 
date of donation. Depreciable assets are being depreciated using the  
 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three years.
 
Contributions
 
Contribution of noncash assets are recorded at their fair value at date  
 
of donation. Contributions received are recorded as unrestricted or  
 
temporarily restricted, depending on the existence and/or nature of the  
 
donor’s gift. If restrictions are fulfilled in the same time period, as the  
 
contribution, the donation is reported as unrestricted.
 
Donated Services
 
The OASIS has many volunteers throughout the year. Time and values  
 
of these services are been tracked, but have not been reported,  
 
pending status and passage of Statement of Financial Accounting  
 
Standards (SFAS) No. 116.
 
Functional Allocation of Expenses
 
The costs of providing the various programs and other activities have  
 
been summarized on a functional basis in the statement of activities.  
 
Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the program and  
 
supporting services benefited. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The Organization is exempt from federal income tax under provision of  
 
Section 501 (c) (3) of the  Internal Revenue Code. No provisions for  
 
income taxes have been provided in the statements. 
 
Funds held as agent
 
The Organization has acted as a fiscal agent for several other   
 
organizations in the past. In prior years, these funds were classified on  
 
the statement of financial position as a liability. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, checking  
 
accounts, interest bearing money market accounts and certificates of 
 
deposit with initial maturities not exceeding three months. 
NOTE 2 Contingencies
 
 
The OASIS participates in grant programs assisted by various
 
government agencies. Those programs are subject to financial and
 
compliance audits by the grantors or their  representatives, the purpose
 
of which is to ensure compliance with condition precedent and
 
subsequent to the granting of funds. According to management, any
 
liability for reimbursements which may arise as the result of these
 
audits is not believed to be material. 
The following sections give you a better idea of what to include in the 
notes to your nonprofit’s financial statements, how to disclose changes 
in accounting methods, and how to divulge ongoing lawsuits that your 
stakeholders need to know about.
 
Folks inside and outside your nonprofit review your financial statements to 
figure out how well your organization has done and is doing. However, many 
consider the notes to financial statements more important than the financial 
statements themselves because the notes explain things that the numbers 
can’t. Think of your notes as the written story behind the numbers.
Explaining changes in accounting methods
Indicating the accounting method is usually contained in the first note 
written to your financial statements. Your notes outline the various 
accounting methods that you’ve used to prepare your financial records. 

298
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Changing accounting methods in the middle of your accounting period can 
have an adverse effect on your bottom line or income. All changes that bear 
a significant effect on your reported income or make changes to it should 
be disclosed.
Some common accounting methods disclosed in your notes are
 
✓ Inventory methods chosen to record value and cost: Your chosen 
inventory method sets the price that you used to value your inventory. 
You may have recorded it at the cost you paid for it, or its current 
market value. Whichever method you used should be indicated in the 
notes to the financial statement. Also, you should disclose in the notes 
when you make changes.
 
✓ Depreciation method or writing off of assets: Depreciation is the 
writing off as an expense the cost of an asset over its useful life. 
Because depreciation reduces net assets, changing your depreciation 
method affects your income. Depreciation can present a favorable 
outcome if you have less expense or an unfavorable outcome if you 
have more expense.
Within these methods, you can select from various methods that are 
acceptable policies. So if last year’s statements were prepared using a 
different method, they may not be comparable with the current year’s state-
ments. Financial managers like to compare apples to apples and oranges 
to oranges, but changes to accounting methods will cause you to compare 
apples to oranges. Even though they’re both fruits, they’re pretty different. 
You need to disclose any changes in your accounting methods and the 
financial impact of those changes in your footnotes.
For example, think of the relationship between your statement of activities 
and your statement of financial position. Your statement of activities records 
all expenses and revenues. Your statement of financial position records 
all assets, liabilities, and equity. The difference between revenues and 
expenses are closed out to the statement of financial position as an increase 
or decrease in net assets. So if you change the accounting method for any 
account tied to an expense, the change in method makes a difference in your 
net assets.
Two principles shed some light on changes in accounting methods. 
 
✓ The Full Disclosure Principle: This principle states that investors 
and creditors have every right to information relevant to the user’s 
decision making.
 
 Don’t get me wrong, this doesn’t mean that everything should be 
disclosed; but anything that may have a material effect on your 
organization’s financial health should be disclosed in the notes to your 
financial statements.

299
 Chapter 19: Closing the Nonprofit Books
 
✓ The Consistency Principle: This principle states that consistency 
should be used with the same accounting events period after period. In 
other words, don’t switch between methods for the same accounting 
event every time a full moon rolls around.
Noting all lawsuits
Because some lawsuits may have an adverse effect on your nonprofit’s 
finances, you need to disclose any lawsuits in the notes of your financial 
statements. The disclosure should describe the nature of the litigation, 
possible outcomes, and financial impact if known. Why do you need to 
include this information? Your stakeholders need to know who may poten-
tially want to sue you and why because they have a vested interest in your 
livelihood. Plus, GAAP requires this information. For example, a disgruntled 
employee may want to sue you seeking damages for injury or workers 
compensation, or someone may want to take you to court for wrongful death 
or negligence of someone entrusted in your care. For instance, if you operate 
a nonprofit daycare facility and one of your employees leaves a child in a van, 
you could face a lawsuit from a disgruntled parent.
Although you can’t prevent lawsuits, you can protect your organization by 
purchasing liability insurance to offset the effects of someone winning a case 
against your organization. (Check out Chapter 3 for more info about how to 
protect your nonprofit with insurance.)
Including all contingent liabilities
You also need to report in the notes information about future events that 
may occur. It’s not pleasant to think about, but anything that could have a 
material effect on your net assets should be disclosed. A future event that 
may occur but whose occurrence is not certain is called a contingency. Like 
terrorist threats, contingencies pose a threat to your organization’s ongoing 
concern. Examples of things that could be considered contingencies are
 
✓ An ex-employee’s lawsuit for lost wages or wrongful termination 
 
✓ Not filing Form 990 and forgetting to file an extension that results in 
penalties
Check out Figure 19-2 for how the wording appears for contingent liabilities 
in the notes.

Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Noting conditions on assets and liabilities
Sometimes donors impose restriction on the assets they give your nonprofit, 
and these restrictions need to be included in the notes to your financial state-
ments. Also, if you have pledged assets as collateral for loans, you should 
include this in the notes. If you have long-term liabilities, you should disclose 
the effective interest rate, maturity dates, repayment terms, and so on. 
Putting Last Year Behind You 
and Looking Forward
After you’ve closed the books, you can prepare your financial statements 
(see Chapters 15-18). When all of that number crunching is finished, make 
sure to store the journals, general ledger, and any supporting documentation 
someplace safe. You never know when you’re going to need that info, and 
you definitely don’t want to mix the old records with the new ones.
You also need to start a new set of books for the new fiscal year. Start 
with journaling, maintain good records throughout the year, and end with 
polished audited financial statements. When you end the year, you’ll find 
yourself going over the same procedures for the next. Think about how good 
you’ll feel when it’s over.

T
he very thought of being audited makes most people sweat. However, 
you don’t need to get bent out of shape. Audited financial records add 
credibility to your organization, especially when you get the green light or a 
good report. An audit is a careful evaluation of your accounting systems to 
ensure that your financial data is accurate and complete. At the end of the 
audit process, you’re given a professional opinion about your organization’s 
financial practices and statements.
This chapter focuses on the financial audit, which inspects your financial 
data to report whether the information meets standards and requirements. 
(Check out Chapter 12 for more information about a grant audit.) This chap-
ter outlines what you can do to ensure your financial books are on the up and 
up in case you ever face an IRS audit. If you follow my recommendations in 
this chapter, you can relax. Your audit shouldn’t turn up any surprises.
Understanding the Audit 
Purpose and Need
Getting an audit is like going to the doctor for your annual checkup. You 
don’t want one, but you need one. It’s good for you. An audit determines 
whether recorded information properly reflects your nonprofit’s economic 
events and activities that occurred during the accounting period. (The 

302
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
accounting period is the same as your fiscal year — whatever 12-month period 
was established in your bylaws.) It’s sort of like a final exam at the end of the 
accounting period. It tests your accountability in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) using generally accepted auditing 
standards (GAAS).
Having your bookkeeping and accounting records audited by an external 
auditor shows good financial management and oversight of your nonprofit 
and implies that your nonprofit is a reputable organization. You gain credibil-
ity when you have someone outside your organization inspect your nonprofit 
financial activities and give her professional opinion about whether you’re 
doing things right.
The following sections point out who looks at your audit’s findings and who’s 
involved in the process, including what you need to do to hire an external 
auditor.
Considering the nonprofit constituency
Your constituencies are your supporters or the groups that your organization 
helps or impacts — the public. As a nonprofit, it’s best to establish and main-
tain a good reputation with your constituents. Getting a clean bill of health 
stating that you’re operating according to accounting principles appeases 
your constituents and adds credibility to you.
 
If you get one bad report, even if it’s false, your reputation can be tarnished 
indefinitely. A lot of people are suspicious or skeptical of how nonprofits use 
their donations. Some of the larger nonprofits have left a bad taste in the pub-
lic’s mouth. For example, contributions to the United Way of America dropped 
when it was revealed that the executive director flew first class and enjoyed 
a lavish lifestyle. This type of behavior by the bigwigs makes people wonder 
what the smaller nonprofits, which are less prominent in their communities, 
are doing.
Lots of people depend on you, and many more watch your every move. If you 
miss a step by not keeping your end of the bargain, you can affect the liveli-
hood of your nonprofit and disappoint a lot of people. The financial audit 
reveals how well you’re keeping your end of the bargain to the following folks:
 
✓ Stakeholders: If you were a for-profit entity, you would have stock-
holders. But nonprofits have stakeholders, individuals and groups that 
benefit from your establishment. When you organized your nonprofit, 
you made a vow to help society and relieve some of the government’s 

303
 Chapter 20: Preparing for an Accounting Audit
burden for providing services. In other words, the work you do should 
benefit citizens. Stakeholders use the results of an audit to confirm that 
you’re operating according to the status quo.
 
✓ Nonprofit watchdogs: Naysayers help you stay in line and balance. 
Nonprofit watchdog groups secretly investigate organizations to find 
out what they’re doing wrong. Most nonprofit watchdog groups report 
wrongdoing to the media. Nonprofit watchdogs use the results of a bad 
audit to call your reputation into question.
 
✓ IRS: The IRS is interested in your nonprofit’s finances. Although you may 
never get the dreaded audit letter from the IRS, if you do, you’ll hand 
over your external audit report, and your auditor will work closely with 
the IRS. (Check out the “If You Get Audited by the IRS” section later in 
this chapter for more specific info.)
 
✓ Grant makers: Organizations that want to give you funding for your ser-
vices and programs often request audited financial statements so they 
can determine whether you’ll be a responsible steward of their money.
 
✓ Donors: Individuals may also be interested in the results of your inde-
pendent audit. If your records show that you’re following the rules, 
donors may consider your organization a wise investment.
Knowing who’s involved in the process
The auditing process is more than just a couple of people looking at your 
nonprofit’s books. The process requires two sets of people who must work 
together to ensure your nonprofit’s finances are in good order. They are
 
✓ An external auditor: You need to hire an independent external audi-
tor who can review your financial records. This person ensures that 
your nonprofit’s financial records follow generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) and generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). In 
case the IRS should ever come calling, you’ll be prepared.
 
✓ An internal auditor and audit committee: You need internal folks who 
do checks and balances on in-house practices. You may have one or two 
bookkeepers or a finance manager who runs regular reports and keeps 
a close eye on all the records. Furthermore, federal legislation requires 
that you have an internal audit committee, which is responsible for the 
nonprofit’s financial statements.
To have a successful audit, you need both an external auditor and an internal 
auditor and audit committee. The following sections help you round up these 
team members.

304
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
 
If you need to double-check your own accounting system for internal purposes 
(like if your board of directors requests an audit), you can use your staff to do 
it. This type of audit is called internal auditing. When you need an independent 
audit of your financial statements, the same person who works in your office 
doing your everyday bookkeeping and accounting shouldn’t turn around and 
audit those records. If that person audits your financial statement, he loses his 
independence.
Finding an independent external auditor
One side to the auditing equation is having an independent external audi-
tor examine your books. You should hire a CPA who specializes in public 
accounting to perform a financial audit. Accountants who pass a comprehen-
sive exam and receive their license as a CPA are the only ones qualified to 
evaluate your financial position and offer a professional opinion.
 
Accountants compile financial statements, and CPAs audit them. Don’t con-
fuse the two.
An external auditor should have no ties to you, your cause, or your staff and/
or board, personally or professionally (other than doing the audit, of course). 
This is what’s meant by independent. You need to avoid conflicts of interest 
between your auditor and your nonprofit. It’s your responsibility, not the 
auditor’s, to determine whether your auditor is associated with you, your col-
leagues, or your cause in any manner.
 
Finding the right auditor should be done by your audit committee (see the 
next section about how to select your audit committee). The best way to find 
a CPA with experience auditing nonprofit organizations is to ask for referrals 
from other agencies in your city. You can also call your local chamber of com-
merce to see if someone there can recommend a good CPA.
Forming an internal audit committee
In addition to hiring an external auditor, you need to have internal auditors 
and an internal audit committee. The internal auditors may be one or two 
individuals who regularly check your financial records. More important is 
your audit committee, which is responsible for overseeing the organization’s 
annual audit of financial statements and ensuring those statements accu-
rately represent your organization’s financial position.
 
Whether you need or can afford internal auditors, external auditors, and an 
audit committee depends on the size of your nonprofit. Some states (like 
California) offer guidance in how nonprofits are evaluated according to the 
size of their operating budgets.
 
✓ A nonprofit budget under $300,000 may be considered small and prob-
ably doesn’t need an audit committee.

305
 Chapter 20: Preparing for an Accounting Audit
 
✓ One with a budget between $300,000 and $500,000 may be considered 
medium size. If this describes your organization, you may want to form 
an audit committee, but it’s not a must.
 
✓ An organization with an operating budget of $500,000 or more is likely to 
be considered large and should have an audit committee.
Your internal audit committee works with the external auditor. After the 
auditor finishes his work, he explains his findings to your audit committee. 
He should also make recommendations to your committee about how to 
improve bookkeeping and accounting procedures.
You need at least three people to serve on your audit committee. Your board 
of directors should elect or appoint individuals to be on the audit committee. 
The audit committee meets as often as necessary to fulfill its role of select-
ing, hiring, and ensuring that the external auditor’s work is done properly. 
Members of your internal audit committee include your treasurer and quali-
fied board of directors with a background and professional experience in 
accounting, general management, finance, or law.
Searching for Accountability: 
Leaving a Paper Trail
In order for your external auditor to review your nonprofit’s finances and 
issue his opinion, he needs to have access to the proper records and paper-
work. You can save yourself some money if you separate your expenses and 
revenues and record them on a piece of paper, a computer spreadsheet, 
or preferably a computer program like QuickBooks and give them to your 
accountant. He’ll want to see copies of the following documents to prove 
what’s in your nonprofit’s financial records and financial statements:
 
✓ Payment receipts: These include copies of checks or bills stamped paid.
 
✓ Vendors’ statements: These are invoices submitted by the people you 
do business with.
 
✓ Bills: Provide these for utilities, rent, insurance, and other things.
 
✓ Donation receipts: These include copies of checks, letters sent with checks, 
and anything else a donor may have given when making a donation.
 
✓ Donors list and receipts: Your auditor will verify the accuracy of your 
donors list by contacting a few people on it. He won’t have time to con-
tact every person on the list, but he’ll choose a random sampling of 
names to verify the amount given.

Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
If you find yourself searching for these items as you gather them, resolve to do 
a better job of keeping and organizing your documents next year. Chapter 4 
has loads of helpful tips.
Walking through the Audit Process
Have you ever wondered exactly what auditors do? Although the nitty-gritty of 
what the auditor does when he reviews your nonprofit’s finances is beyond 
the scope of this book, it’s helpful to have a basic grasp of what to expect.
The auditor doesn’t use rocket science or some complicated math formula to 
form an opinion. Rather, the auditor has generally accepted auditing standards 
(GAAS) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to guide his anal-
ysis. (Refer to Chapter 1 for an introduction to these two sets of guidelines.) 
The following sections take a look at what the auditor does to get an opinion.
Phase I: Planning and design
During Phase I, your auditor obtains information, such as copies of your 
articles of incorporation, current bylaws, list of current board members, min-
utes of the board of directors and committee meetings, and your IRS letter of 
determination, from you about the background of your organization and your 
legal liabilities in an attempt to understand your internal controls and assess 
fraud risk.
Your auditor uses this information to develop an overall audit plan. No two 
organizations are alike, so no one method works for every nonprofit. The 
auditor will follow certain steps, but he must plan and design an audit based 
on your organization’s size and scope of work.
Phase II: Calculating audit risk
During Phase II, the auditor assesses the type of audit risk involved and 
determines how long the audit will last and how much it will cost. Risk falls 
into two camps:
 
✓ Acceptable: An acceptable audit risk measures the auditor’s willingness 
to accept that the financial statements you gave him may be materially 
misstated (based on the auditor’s professional judgment) after the audit 
is complete. Think of it like this: The auditor is taking a chance by basing 
a decision on your information after performing tests on it.

307
 Chapter 20: Preparing for an Accounting Audit
 
✓ Inherent: Inherent risk measures the likelihood that your financial state-
ments have material misstatements before considering internal controls. 
Your auditor has to determine the likelihood that your financial state-
ments may not be legit. Just by looking at your financial statements, 
some auditors can detect that something isn’t right, sort of like the way 
a dog sniffs out fear.
 
It’s better for you if your auditor determines that the risk involved in auditing 
your nonprofit is acceptable. It means his neck probably won’t be on the line. 
And because the level of risk determines the cost of an audit, an acceptable 
audit risk probably will be cheaper for you.
Phase III: Analysis
Your auditor has to assess the overall reasonableness of your transactions 
by analytical tests or detailed tests of balances. This is done by determining 
sample items (which items will be evaluated), sample size (how many items 
will be verified), and reaching an audit conclusion about what to measure, 
mostly in terms of monetary value. GAAS outline how auditors should per-
form these tests, which include
 
✓ Procedures to obtain an understanding of internal controls
 
✓ Tests of usefulness of policies and procedures
 
✓ Reasonableness of account balances
 
✓ Testing balance details to see if the audit objectives have been satisfied 
by the balances on the accounts
Usually, auditors also ask to see financial statements for more than one 
period to compare. A good auditor can look at the numbers and detect if 
something is grossly wrong. If there’s a big increase or decrease in your 
spending, it shows in your expenses. After performing the required tests and 
looking at your financial statements, an auditor can do a reasonable assess-
ment of your true financial position.
Phase IV: Gathering final evidence 
and issuing the report
Phase IV is the final phase of the audit. Your auditor gathers financial infor-
mation to summarize the results and issue the audit report, to review or pre-
pare your financial statements, and to prepare the notes of disclosure (see 
Chapter 19 for more on notes). During the final review the auditor looks for 

308
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
contingent liabilities to include in the notes. Contingent liabilities are pend-
ing lawsuits, potential losses, and balloon payments that your nonprofit may 
have to settle or pay.
Your auditor does a final analysis to evaluate the going concern concept, 
which indicates that your nonprofit will continue for another accounting 
period. He also writes a letter stating that your financial statements have 
been audited. And then he reads your annual report to check that it repre-
sents what’s in the financial statements.
After all of this, your auditor issues a report (see the next section). The audi-
tor’s report shares your auditor’s professional opinion of your nonprofit’s finan-
cial stability based on information given, a series of audit tests, and a careful 
analysis of your financial position as stated on your financial statements.
After the Audit Is Finished: Receiving 
the Auditor’s Report
The job of an external auditor isn’t glamorous. Believe me, I did it for six 
months, and I’ve had root canals that were more exciting. However, an 
auditor ensures your nonprofit’s finances are in order, so he’s got a pretty 
important job. When your auditor is finished reviewing all the numbers, he 
communicates his findings in the form of an auditor’s report. A good auditor 
will always find something wrong with your records and make suggestions 
about ways to improve your financial and managerial systems.
 
As the executive director or manager of your nonprofit, you and your board 
are responsible for the results of your audit and its findings. It’s up to you and 
your board of directors to take action, as necessary, on the audit findings. 
Responsibility for the overall nonprofit lies with the board of directors.
The audit is based on information submitted by you. It’s your responsibility to 
make sure the information is accurate. (Check out the earlier section, “Searching 
For Accountability: Leaving a Paper Trail,” for what you need to provide the audi-
tor.) The following sections give you the lowdown on the importance of the audi-
tor’s professional opinion and the four types you may encounter.
Eyeing the importance of the opinion
Your auditor hasn’t been privy to every transaction that has taken place over the 
course of the accounting period; therefore, all he can do is issue an opinion 

309
 Chapter 20: Preparing for an Accounting Audit
about your financial statements. This opinion is professional in nature and is 
based on acceptable standards found in GAAP and GAAS. Your auditor issues 
a formal report stating his opinion after he completes his review of your non-
profit’s finances. Minor findings are reported to management in a manage-
ment letter.
You can then use the auditor’s report as a tool when reporting financial 
information to your constituents. The auditor’s opinion can attract donors, 
investors, and grant makers to your nonprofit, or it can deter them. These 
days, people place a good amount of emphasis on having audited financial 
information, so many donors won’t even consider investing in your organiza-
tion without looking at audited financial statements.
Identifying the types of auditor 
opinions you can receive
After the auditor evaluates your nonprofit’s financial statements, the 
accounting firm where the auditor works issues a report about your records 
and gives an opinion. Note: Only a CPA can issue a valid opinion about your 
financial statements. The auditor expresses his opinion in a traditional seven-
part report. The report has a letter that includes the report title, address, 
introductory paragraph, scope paragraph, opinion paragraph, name of the 
CPA firm, and the report date.
 
Just receiving the opinion isn’t enough. You need to know what it means and 
what to do with it.
Included in the report will be findings, which are conclusions the auditor 
reaches after reviewing your financial statements. Some audit findings are 
considered common because they have no significant material effect on your 
organization. Common findings include suggesting ways to implement better 
bookkeeping and accounting methods.
The following sections point out the different types of opinions you can 
receive from an auditor and what you need to know about each one to help 
your nonprofit improve its condition.
Unqualified opinion
The unqualified opinion means that your auditor believes the financial state-
ments are free from material misstatements and are in accordance with 
GAAP. This is the most desirable type of report to receive, because it means 
your organization’s financial condition is fairly represented in the financial 
statements.

310
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
If you receive this opinion from your auditor, congratulations. Your nonprof-
it’s financial status is a clean bill of health. You don’t have to worry if the IRS 
comes knocking.
Qualified opinion
Just by looking at the name, you’d think this would be the most desirable 
opinion, but it’s not. A qualified opinion means the auditor saw one of two 
things:
 
✓ You deviated from GAAP in one or more areas of the financial statements.
 
✓ The auditor couldn’t verify a certain area because you didn’t have the 
information.
For instance, say that you gave your auditor a list of donors, but the contact 
information was missing, so the auditor couldn’t verify the donors’ gifts. 
Everything else presented was in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, the 
auditor will state in the report that your financial statements were presented 
fairly, with the exception of the donors’ gifts, which couldn’t be audited.
 
Having a qualified opinion isn’t a bad report; everything that the auditor 
looked at checked out okay. But something was missing that wouldn’t allow 
the auditor to verify or test your records. If you had this missing element, you 
probably would’ve checked out with an unqualified opinion report.
If you receive a qualified opinion, your auditor will make suggestions about 
how to avoid losing important information needed to audit your records. You 
should take the necessary steps to correct your problems. Then the next 
time your records are audited, you’ll pass the test.
Adverse opinion
An adverse opinion is issued when your financial statements have material 
misstatement and don’t conform to GAAP. Think of an adverse opinion as the 
exact opposite of the unqualified opinion.
 
If you receive an adverse opinion, you need to get your act together. Your 
auditor will give you a list of things to do and make several suggestions about 
how to fix your problems. Just follow his professional opinion by cleaning up 
your act.
Disclaimer of opinion
If you get a disclaimer of opinion report, it means the auditor can’t form an 
opinion or refuses to issue one. Usually this happens when the auditor can’t 
finish the work necessary to complete an audit. Certain situations warrant a 
disclaimer:

311
 Chapter 20: Preparing for an Accounting Audit
 
✓ A lack of independence or conflict of interest exists between your 
nonprofit and the auditor: Unless your auditor is independent, he 
shouldn’t issue an opinion about your financial statements. If you’re 
related to your auditor, this presents a conflict of interest.
 
✓ A lack of evidence on which to perform procedures: There is just not 
enough documented information available to do the audit.
 
✓ Based on the information presented, your nonprofit won’t exist much 
longer: The going concern concept states that your organization should 
continue to operate for future accounting periods. In other words, an 
auditor can’t issue an opinion if it violates GAAP principles.
 
✓ If you hide or withhold information from your auditor: If your auditor 
suspects that he doesn’t have all the information he needs to conduct a 
thorough audit, he’ll have to issue a disclaimer of opinion.
 
If you receive a disclaimer, I suggest you call an emergency board meeting and 
work aggressively to fix your situation. An auditor won’t place his stamp of 
approval on anything that’s not valid, so you have some serious bookkeeping 
and accounting issues to resolve.
If You Get Audited by the IRS
Because you’ve received tax-exempt status from the IRS to operate your non-
profit, you may be required to get an independent auditor to audit your finan-
cial statements. The IRS also expects you to practice good bookkeeping and 
accounting practices in compliance with GAAP (generally accepted account-
ing principles) and GAAS (generally accepted auditing standards).
According to the IRS, about 1.9 million nonprofits have been formed in the 
United States. With nonprofits popping up like popcorn, the IRS is trying to 
control the nonprofit population. One way that it keeps tabs on organizations 
is by conducting an IRS audit.
Just like with your personal taxes, your nonprofit may be selected for an 
audit at random. You may also be audited if someone reports you to the IRS 
for questionable activity or if the IRS suspects something fishy is going on.

Publication 892, Exempt Organization Appeal Procedures for Unagreed Issues, 
for more about your nonprofit’s rights when it comes to the IRS audit.

312
Part IV: Wrapping Up the Books 
Unless the IRS suspects that you’ve committed a crime, the IRS usually noti-
fies you by mail that you’re going to be audited. If you’ve committed a crime 
or are under criminal investigation, the feds may just show up and take your 
records. (This is rare, but it happens. Usually, serious violations are sus-
pected or have been reported when this occurs.)
 
I hope you never get that dreaded letter from the IRS, but if you do, don’t turn 
on the shredder and start getting rid of stuff. Instead, call the accounting firm 
that did your audit and tell your auditor you’re being audited. Get some help 
because you don’t want to face Uncle Sam alone.
If you’ve played by the rules, then you have nothing to worry about, right? 
Well, that depends. Sometimes not knowing the rules will get you some 
mercy, but then the IRS has to decide whether what you did was intentional, 
fraudulent, or careless oversight.
Recent reports indicate that the IRS is not as mean as it used to be. Now the 
agency is willing to work with you. Even if you’re savvy enough to read the 
fine print and work through the red tape, I still advise you to seek profes-
sional help from a CPA.

the accountability you need to pass an audit and meet the 
federal guidelines that relate to your organization. You 
can also find ten pointers to remember when keeping your 
books to ensure everything balances and your nonprofit 
remains solvent.

Ten Important Things to Know 
When Keeping Nonprofit Books
In This Chapter
▶ Safeguarding your assets
▶ Documenting donations
▶ Getting help
A
s the executive director or manager of a nonprofit, your job is to 
make sure your organization’s books are in order. You want to 
make sure your staff follows the guidelines set in the generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP). You also want to verify that you and your 
staff are following these guidelines through detailed documentation.
This chapter reviews the ten most important things you need to know when 
keeping your nonprofit’s books. Ignoring any of these items can negatively 
impact your nonprofit’s books and the success or future of your organization.
Watch Cash Contributions
Cash is the most liquid and volatile asset because it’s the hardest asset to 
track after you exchange or receive it. To prevent any potential problems, 
your organization needs to have an in-house policy that describes how 
to receive and handle cash. When you establish your policy, remember that 
the same person should never both receive the cash and pay the bills. 
Accountants refer to policies like this example of segregation of duties as 
internal controls.
Another example of internal controls: You can put up a sign on your clerk’s 
desk reminding donors that they should receive receipts for all donations. 
Without this receipt policy (and sign), you increase the risk that the 
clerk may pocket the money because your nonprofit has no record of the 
transaction without physical documentation.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Keep a Donors List
Making a donors list and checking it twice pays off. A donors list is simply a 
complete and up-to-date list of all the people who have donated to your 
organization, including their names, phone numbers, and addresses, along 
with the dates they donated and the amounts they contributed. Updating 
this list is important because the IRS may need to verify a donor’s list. For 
example, when someone deducts a charitable donation from his income 
taxes, the IRS sometimes tracks this donation back to the organization that 
received it to verify that person’s donation. Your up-to-date donors list can 
provide the verification the IRS is looking for.
 
When your CPA audits your books, he requires a donors list. During the audit, 
your CPA performs a random test by contacting some of the people on your 
donors list to verify contributions.
Balance Your Nonprofit Checkbook
Every organization needs a system of checks and balances. Your checkbook 
is the first place to start when you’re trying to get a handle on your finances. 
Even if your checkbook is out of balance, you still need to know how much 
money you have, how much you have spent, and how much you need.
Because banks make mistakes, you must keep an eye on your checking 
account to make sure you and the bank are on the same page at all times. If 
possible, get online banking and review your account often.
Leave a Paper Trail
Document and keep copies of everything that takes place in your 
organization — services and programs offered, celebrations had, salaries 
paid, and so on. Keep copies of every receipt, invoice, and bill paid. 
Make copies of all the checks your organization writes to justify and verify 
your expenses. Every transaction that occurs in your organization has to 
leave a clear path that explains when it happens, why it happens, and how 
it happens.
 
When you have supporting documentation to justify every transaction that 
takes place in your nonprofit, you maintain your accountability. Plus, 
complete documentation allows you to clearly and accurately show why you 
did what you did, who gave you what, when things happened, and how you 
kept up with them. Your auditor will want to see invoices, receipts, and other 
documents to verify your financial activities.

Protect Your Nonprofit 
from Employee Theft
Unfortunately, nonprofits face a similar problem that for-profits face — 
employees who steal from their own organizations. You can lessen the 
impact of employee theft by protecting yourself. Take the following simple 
actions to help protect your assets:
 
✓ Give your potential employees a standard test. By having potential 
employees answer certain questions, you can gauge the likelihood 
that they may steal. These tests are usually electronic and include 
multiple-choice questions that ask potential employees what they 
would do in certain scenarios. For example, one question may ask what 
you would do if you witnessed another employee stealing from the 
organization. Answers to questions like this one are good indicators of 
personal values, ethics, and attitudes.
 
✓ Segregate duties. Segregating duties means not putting the same person 
in charge of making decisions about purchases, writing checks to 
pay for the same purchases, receiving the purchases, and keeping up 
with inventory. When you don’t segregate duties, you make yourself 
vulnerable to potential employee theft because if the same employee is 
in charge of all duties regarding a particular purchase, she can steal the 
purchase, and no one would know. After all, no one else may even know 
the purchase was made.
 
✓ Place security cameras in your building. Security cameras protect 
you from outside threats as well as internal threats by recording what 
happens in your building at all times.
 
✓ Do background checks on potential employees. In some states, 
employers have to do background checks on volunteers and employees 
who may work with children. Check with your attorney general’s office 
or state department of public safety for information about how to get a 
background check of a potential employee. Always get prior signed 
approval from the potential employee before doing a background check. 
Sometimes you can even get the potential employee to pay for it. Do a 
little homework before you choose a company to do your background 
checks because fees vary.
 
✓ Reference a potential employee’s credit reports. Pulling a potential 
employee’s credit history can help you gauge that person’s character. 
Responsible individuals usually pay their bills on time. Make sure 
you get signed approval from the potential employee before running a 
credit history.
Talk to your auditor about other protective measures you can take to 
safeguard your assets. Check out Chapter 2 for more about protecting your 
organization’s assets.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Consider Your Constituency
Your constituencies are your donors and the people you serve. In the 
nonprofit world, your constituencies are your stakeholders — individuals 
who have a vested interest in your outcome to make a positive difference 
in the lives of the people in your community. Your stakeholders are very 
important to the livelihood of your organization because your organization 
can’t survive without the people who donate money or the people who 
use your services. Therefore, before making any major decision, always 
consider the impact it will have on your constituency.
Stay in Compliance
In exchange for your tax-exempt status, you have certain obligations to fulfill 
to the state and federal governments. You can stay within the guidelines 
the IRS gives you by filing all necessary paperwork in a timely fashion. You 
have to follow the IRS’s rules regarding how you should operate and run your 
program on a daily basis to maintain your tax-exempt status. In addition, 
if your nonprofit receives federal grants, you should have received a list of 
policies along with your grant award that you need to follow to continue to 
receive your grant funds.
 
Three of the most important rules you need to stay in compliance with are
 
✓ File your 990 on time. If you forget to file Form 990 for three years in a 
row, you lose your nonprofit tax-exempt status.
 
✓ Avoid commercial activities. If you start operating like a for-profit 
entity, you can lose your nonprofit status.
 
✓ Stay out of politics. If you start campaigning and encouraging others 
who benefit from your services to vote a certain way, you can jeopardize 
your tax-exempt status with the IRS.
Check out Chapter 9 for more on staying in compliance with the IRS.
Track the Truth in the Books
When you and your staff are keeping track of your nonprofit’s books, don’t 
cook your books. Show your numbers just as they are because honesty is 
always the best policy. Plus, if you plan to be around for the long haul, you 
need to build a solid reputation for yourself and your organization.

319
 Chapter 21: Ten Important Things to Know When Keeping Nonprofit Books
Executive directors are required to sign off on financial statements stating 
that the records are presented accurately according to accounting records. 
Your signature means that the statements are a fair representation of your 
true financial position. If you lie about your financial position, you’ll likely 
lose your credibility in other areas, too. You may even lose your job or your 
organization. You don’t want to end up going down the same path that Enron 
and others who falsified their books followed, do you?
Keep Charities and Politics Separate
Remember, you can encourage the public to vote, but if you’re not an 
advocacy group, don’t rock the boat by rallying and campaigning for 
candidates. Also, never use your Web site, newsletters, or any other form 
of advertisement to persuade people to vote for a particular candidate.
You have only one vote — yours, not your organization’s — and although 
you have the right to exercise that vote, you don’t have the right to use your 
nonprofit organization to persuade other people how to exercise their votes. 
Using your organization to sway beneficiaries to vote for a specific candidate 
is something you can’t do if you want to keep your tax-exempt status, as well 
as maintain a positive image for both you and your organization.
Get Free Support
Running a nonprofit definitely has its challenges. One way to make everything 
a tad easier is to rely on the free support available. I suggest you start with 
the following two services first:
 
✓ IRS: Although you may not realize this fact, the IRS actually does want to 
help you. The IRS offers many free classes to assist you with operating 
your nonprofit. For convenience, many courses are offered online, and 
conference calls can be scheduled to discuss issues that directly affect 
your organization.
 
 For example, the IRS offers several free training courses to assist you 
with filling out and complying with Form 990. If you require help with 
your payroll or tax forms, or if you have other burning tax-related 
questions, you can contact the IRS for answers. For more information 
about training provided by the IRS, visit www.irs.gov.
 
✓ SCORE: Assess your organization’s weaknesses and search for ways 
to strengthen its capacity by taking advantage of the many free 
services offered by SCORE, a nonprofit association that counsels 
small businesses in America. If you need a little help with the overall 
operations of your nonprofit, contact SCORE online at www.score.org.

Chapter 22
Ten Tips to Keep Your 
Nonprofit Viable
In This Chapter
▶ Managing day-to-day operations
▶ Strategizing your future
▶ Working your network
A
ccountability is more important than ever in the nonprofit sector. 
People think very hard about where to invest their hard-earned 
dollars, and to maintain good standing in your books, you need people to 
see your organization as a solid investment option. Long gone are the days 
when a man’s word was his bond. Today you have to prove that you’re a 
good steward if you want to receive donations; after all, people aren’t going 
to give money because of what you say but rather because of what you do 
and stand for.
Consider changing your mindset of doing business as usual. The fundraising 
method you’ve been using for years may not appeal to donors today. Every 
gift you receive is an investment in your programs and services, so letting 
donors know that you’re valid and trustworthy is important.
Although your community programs and services are the reason behind 
your nonprofit, its daily operation depends on much more than just these 
programs to survive. Clearly, the organization can’t flourish without finances; 
after all, money is the oil that keeps the wheels turning. This chapter 
gives you a few tips to help keep your head above water. It addresses the 
importance of balancing your books, maintaining a positive reputation, 
planning your future, and making the right connections.
Keeping Your Books Balanced
A good financial manager wants to evaluate how she’s doing at the end of 
each month. To keep a good handle on your income and expenses, have 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
your bookkeeper do monthly financial reports. One thing you definitely want 
to watch in these reports is how your operating budget compares to what’s 
actually taking place in your organization. (For more information about how 
to compare your actual results to what you planned, see Chapter 8.)
 
Not keeping balanced books can cost you some hefty overdraft banking 
fees and cause you to lose your credibility with creditors and vendors. As a 
result, your organization may receive a bad credit rating, which can affect 
your organization’s financial future. See Chapter 7 for how to balance your 
organization’s checkbook.
You need to set up your accounting system to make updates to your books 
automatically. When you enter or change something in one field, your system 
should be able to show the results of that change in terms of your overall 
financial situation. For more information about setting up your accounting 
system, see Chapter 4.
Waiting until the end of the year to put your books in order isn’t good 
financial management. Suppose you have an emergency situation to resolve 
(like an unexpected computer crash or a pipe that bursts), and you need to 
quickly evaluate how much money you have and compare that to how much 
money you need to correct your problem. Keeping your books balanced can 
save you a lot of time during an emergency, not to mention during tax season.
File Paperwork with the IRS
No matter the size of your nonprofit, you have to file the appropriate paper-
work with the IRS to keep your nonprofit status active. The IRS occasionally 
changes the threshold amounts that determine which form your organization 
needs to file, so visit www.irs.gov/charities/article to stay current. 
For example, for tax years prior to 2010, nonprofits that generated $25,000 or 
less in gross revenue can file Form 990-N (e-Postcard). Beginning with the 
2010 tax year, this amount changes to $50,000 or less.
If your organization generates more than $25,000 in gross receipts per year 
(or more than $50,000 in the 2010 tax year), but less than $1 million (or 
$500,000 in the 2009 tax year or $200,000 in the 2010 tax year), you get to 
choose whether to file Form 990-EZ or Form 990. If your gross receipts are 
more than $1 million (or $500,000 in the 2009 tax year or $200,000 in the 2010 
tax year), you have to file Form 990.
In summary, the decision about whether to file Form 990-N, Form 990-EZ, or 
Form 990 is based on the gross receipts your organization generates in a 
given year and your total assets for that year. For the most up-to-date info 

323

about which form to file, go to www.irs.gov/charities/article/
0,,id=184445,00.html. Check out Chapter 14 for more on the specific 
paperwork you need to file with the IRS.
Pay Bills on Time
Your organization has a reputation, and you have to do whatever you can 
to maintain its good name. To keep a good reputation (and to keep your 
books accurate and up to date), pay your utilities, rent, employees, vendors, 
creditors, and all other bills on time.
Just as paying bills on time is important for your own personal credit score, 
paying bills is also important for your organization’s credit score. If you find 
that you can’t meet your obligations, call your creditors. Many of them may 
be willing to work out some type of arrangement to keep you as a customer.
 
Use reminders, such as your wall calendar, cellphone or PDA, and computer 
calendar, to help you remember to pay your bills on time. Nowadays, you 
have no excuse for forgetting to be on time.
Explore New Fundraising Ideas
No matter how large or small your nonprofit is, you don’t want your fund-
raising efforts to become stagnant. Without fundraising money coming in, 
your nonprofit’s bottom line can suffer. To keep fundraising fresh, consider 
new ideas.
 
The best way to come up with new ideas is to brainstorm with your staff 
and board members to generate innovative ways to bring funding to your 
nonprofit. Forget about what everyone else is doing and figure out your own 
approach. Have your staff and board members list any ideas that come to 
mind. Remember that no idea is bad. You’d be surprised at the types of 
innovative ways to keep your head above water in terms of fundraising. 
After you finish brainstorming, break down the list and look at the ideas to 
determine which ones work best for your nonprofit.
Watch Your Nonprofit’s Bottom Line
Pay close attention to giving trends and track your nonprofit’s budget on a 
monthly basis. Compare what happens to what you expected to happen and 
take note of the differences. By doing so, you can identify signs and signals 
that may indicate a problem — these signs can be very helpful in the future.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Keeping a close eye on your nonprofit’s bottom line is key to survival. You 
may not be running the nonprofit to make money, but you can’t function 
without it. You need money to run programs, to pay employees, and to keep 
the lights on. Make sure you know how much money your nonprofit has 
at all times (for more information on how to keep track of your expenses and 
donations, see Chapter 7).
Analyze, Plan, and Project 
Future Funding Streams
Believe it or not, your nonprofit is a business. Your board needs to have a 
clear vision about the future of your organization. To do so, you and your 
board need to know where you’re going, how you can get there, and how 
much money you need to get there. Make sure you do the following:
 
✓ Analyze. Assess where you are now and where you want your nonprofit 
to be in three to five years. This is called ongoing concern. A good 
manager keeps the day-to-day operations functioning while also 
preparing for tomorrow’s expansion and growth.
 
✓ Plan. Create a business plan or strategic plan that clearly sets the path 
for your future.
 
✓ Evaluate. Assess where you are and project future resources to evaluate 
whether your nonprofit is meeting its plan.
Check out Chapter 8 for more in-depth information about these three points.
Get Grant-Writing Training
Federal grants provide an important way for your nonprofit to receive 
money to pay for its programs. However, you can’t receive federal grants 
if you don’t know how to correctly apply for and request the grant money, 
so knowing how to write grants is to your advantage. Your nonprofit helps 
your community by supporting people through services, and because you 
qualified for nonprofit status, you’re eligible for grant funding.
Find out where to find grants, how to apply for grants, and how the federal 
grant system works by getting some training. Contact your local university or 
United Way office to find out where training is available. If you prefer online 
classes, you can get quality online training through Education To Go (ed2go); 

325
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips to Keep Your Nonprofit Viable
find a list of online courses at www.ed2go.com/. Or, if you prefer books over 
computer screens, take a look at Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by 
Beverly A. Browning (Wiley).
If you prefer more personal attention, consider hiring a grant consultant to 
mentor and coach you through the grant-writing process. A grant consultant 
can give you insight about the process from the perspectives of both the 
granting agency and your organization. Knowing more about grant writing 
increases your chances of receiving grants and placing your nonprofit on the 
government’s grant map.
 
Gain the knowledge you need to relieve some of your financial worries by 
getting some help. Put together a team within your organization to find out 
more about how corporations, foundations, and government agencies award 
grants. Take advantage of the information available to you at www.grants.
gov. Read the information on that site about how to narrow your search for 
grants before you start going down the crowded grant highway. Check out 
Chapter 10 for more.
Get an Independent Audit
Getting an independent financial audit is not an option, it’s a requirement. 
An independent auditor is a certified public accountant (CPA) who audits 
your organization’s financial records and offers a professional opinion 
about whether your records are prepared according to national accounting 
standards. Your independent auditor must be unbiased in the view and 
performance of professional services. For more about selecting and hiring 
an independent auditor, see Chapter 20.
Get Acquainted with Elected Officials
Wouldn’t you like your organization to be a line item in the government’s 
budget? To have a government appropriation set aside just for your nonprofit 
is a director’s dream. Well, sometimes dreams do come true.
Knowing your elected officials is definitely to your benefit, but even more 
important is making sure they know you and your organization — what you 
do and how the community benefits from your existence. By knowing your 
elected officials, you gain strong advocates who can help you secure funding 
for your organization. Notify your senators before you submit a federal grant 
application and get letters of support from them. Your senators can rally for 
you and your organization only if they know about you.

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Plus, when you’re applying directly to federal agencies for grants, you want 
to make sure your elected officials are aware of what your needs are so 
they can rally for you when related topics come up for discussion. Building 
relationships with your elected officials isn’t supporting one candidate over 
another; it’s putting your already-elected officials to work for you.
Attend Networking Activities
To have a viable and fluid nonprofit, you have to network with the important 
people and organizations in your community. In other words, you need 
to reach out to your city’s chamber of commerce, United Way office, 
city councilmen and women, representatives, congressmen and women, 
governor, and other key people and organizations.
The reason is simple. These organizations and people, such as the chamber 
of commerce and the governor, have a good understanding of the direction in 
which your city is moving, in terms of new industries and other forms of 
growth. You need to know which new companies are coming to your city so 
you can present your cause to them and, hopefully, solicit their support. 
Furthermore, other organizations, such as United Way, usually know most of 
the other nonprofits in your state. Using their resources, you can find out 
more about your competition. However, don’t think of this as a turf war of us 
against them; instead, think of your competition as your allies.
After all, your organization isn’t about you; it’s about the people you serve. I 
see too many small nonprofits fighting among themselves for the crumbs 
(minigrants of $25,000 or less) and missing the big picture — coming together 
to help better serve the community as a whole.

For Dummies: Bestselling Book Series for Beginners
Weekly Reminders
Organizing a weekly to-do list with daily priorities ensures that important items are taken care of first and everything else is 
scheduled around them. As a director or manager of a nonprofit, planning your week and sticking to your plan is important to 
staying organized and on top of your game.
  Set up daily priorities. Knowing what you need to accomplish each day allows you to take care of the most pressing 
matters.
  Surround yourself with professional staff. Surrounding yourself with professionals eliminates the pettiness of daily 
office drama! Professionals are self-motivated and focused on doing their jobs, and they require minimum supervision.
  Keep your goals before you. To maintain a clear vision, keep your eyes on the prize. Post your vision or your goals in a 
place where they’re visible to you every day.
  Manage your time by planning and scheduling your daily activities. Be mindful of distractions that pull you away from 
completing your tasks.
  Stay out of politics. Avoiding politics at work protects your nonprofit’s status.
Monthly Reminders
Because you’re the director or manager in charge, every month you need to do a budget assessment to track and manage 
your nonprofit’s finances. Your finance committee, budget staff, and/or budget task force should meet after doing a cost-
benefit analysis to ensure efficient management.
  Review budget projections and compare the projected budget to actual results. To ensure that you have revenues 
to take care of expenses, evaluate what happened the previous month and what the impact will be on future months. 
Make adjustments to future planned actions based on your actual results to date.
  Trim the fat from your budget. Analyze every line item and look for ways to cut costs.
  Seek ways to cut variable costs. To do so, change them to fixed costs or eliminate them altogether.
  Meet with your budget task group to analyze every cost and get rid of unnecessary ones. Consider everything that 
will keep you efficient without compromising program quality.
  Submit grant proposals and contracts to stabilize your funding streams. Be aggressive in seizing funding opportuni-
ties to sustain and expand your organization’s existing programs while adding new ones.
  Search your local newspaper for new businesses in your area that may support your cause. Find out what their areas 
of interest are and talk to them about working together.
  Look for ways to collaborate with other nonprofits in your community. Form partnerships with larger nonprofits for 
fundraising activities.

Quarterly Reminders
Quarterly reports are required by federal and state government entities for grants, contracts, and taxes. Your board of 
directors needs quarterly financial statements to evaluate your financial health.
  Report payroll taxes to the IRS at the end of the quarter by submitting Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return. 
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes are funds for the payment of old-age, survivors, and medical 
benefits. Employers must pay 7.65 percent of an employee’s gross salary to the IRS.
  Prepare quarterly financial statements for your board of directors. Your board needs to know your financial status to plan 
future activities and to offset potential financial problems.
  Complete quarterly financial status reports for government grants and contracts. The government expects you to track 
all expenditures and submit a report of what you have spent and how much you have left according to your records.
  Complete quarterly progress reports for government grants and contracts. Quarterly progress reports indicate perfor-
mance results in terms of numbers. They evaluate your progress by comparing what you expected to accomplish with 
what actually happened.
  Meet with your board of directors. Your board must meet at least four times a year to fulfill federal and state requirements.
Annual Reminders
Every year you’re required to prepare and submit paperwork to the IRS, Social Security Administration, your board of directors, 
and employees. This also affords you a time to evaluate your progress, update your strategic plan, and celebrate your success.
  Submit Form 990, Annual Information Report, to the IRS. This form is where you report all financial activities to the IRS. It 
reveals your financial strengths and weaknesses, sources of income, and how you’re spending your funds. This informa-
tion helps the government determine whether you’re engaging in activities that could cause you to jeopardize your tax-
exempt status.
  Submit annual payroll reports to the Social Security Administration, IRS, and your employees. Form 941, Employer’s 
Quarterly Federal Tax Return, is due no later than January 31. W-2s, W-3s, and 1099s must be handled properly.
  Contact a CPA to audit your financial statements. Having audited records is like getting a professional second opinion 
about the validity of your financial health. It adds credibility to your record-keeping and accounting practices.
  Celebrate your success and hard work with your staff and board members by having an annual office party. Reward 
everyone for a job well done.
  Organize your budget task force for the next year. Single out the analytical minds or penny-pinchers on your staff and 
board. These folks will make up your budget task force, which assesses all budget costs and does a benefit analysis of 
each line item.
  Organize a proposal development team for the next year. Find three people who are organized, enjoy reading technical 
stuff, and are willing to write. Then organize them into your proposal development team to research, develop, and submit 
grant applications and contracts for your organization.
  Prepare for your annual board meeting by re-evaluating your organization’s goals. Cross out goals you’ve met and 
develop new goals for the upcoming year.
  Declutter your office files and prepare for the next year. Getting rid of the clutter frees your mind and saves time. It’s 
important that you know where things are and can put your hands on them when needed.
