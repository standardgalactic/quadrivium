Indian student develops Web 
app to help citizens track 
cleanliness levels
A computer science student from Jharkhand has developed a new Web application 
that helps citizens track and report the cleanliness levels across India. Dubbed as 
My Clean India, the app is aimed at keeping the country clean and promoting the 
Swachh Bharat campaign.
“I have been seriously watching places around me for a while,” said 20-year-old 
Sourav Badami. “I noticed that not everyone is careless about the hygiene of our 
surroundings – there are some people who care. So, I designed a mock-up that could 
help individuals report and track cleanliness levels as well as help organisations to 
monitor the places they need to take care of,” he added.
The My Clean India app works as a medium application to collect raw data from 
end users and show the facts geographically on a map. Jamshedpur-based Badami 
used the Python language and Django framework to build the core of the app, while 
the entire front end is based on JavaScript and some third-party libraries. The code 
is available on a GitHub repository to receive contributions from the worldwide 
developer community.
“We released the code as open source with the hope of getting some help 
from the developer community,” Badami told Open Source For You in an email 
interaction.
Instead of merely providing a simple cleanliness tracker, Badami’s My Clean 
India app allows users to select their locality and then add a status marker that can be 
Clean, Severe or In-progress. This development provides a single platform to users 
and organisations to report and track different cleanliness levels. “The application can 
be used hassle-free on desktop computers over a Web browser to add a status marker 
on the map of India and let users see all the previous reports,” Badami explained.
Badami used a trial server by Heroku to save on server costs and domain 
charges. Also, open source technologies and various developer tools such as the 
Google Maps API helped in delivering sustainability. 
However, some technical challenges did emerge involving the app’s architecture 
and model design. “We follow an MVT design pattern in our application. Initially, 
I designed the mocks and then started implementing the application from the 
base. But after that, I realised the need for a solid framework that can control the 
application’s flow. I then switched to Django,” said the student developer.

Google develops Grumpy to 
translate Python code into Go 
programs
With a view to overcoming some major 
limitations of Python, Google has 
brought out its transcompiling tool called 
Grumpy. The new open source project 
is designed to translate Python code into 
Go programs to address the concurrency 
issue, and run the transpiled programs 
seamlessly within the Go runtime.
Google’s YouTube and various 
YouTube APIs are the finest example of 
Python-based solutions by the company. 
The front-end of YouTube runs on 
CPython 2.7. Though the high-level 
programming language brought about 
fruitful results to the video streaming 
website, it was restricting the achievements 
on concurrent workloads. This led to the 
demand for an alternative runtime that 
was optimised for real-time serving, and 
ultimately took the shape of Grumpy.
“We are excited about the prospects 
for Grumpy. Although it is still alpha 
software, most of the language constructs 
and many core built-in types work like 
you would expect,” YouTube engineer 
Dylan Trotter wrote in a blog post.
The alpha state of Grumpy limits its 
usage. The tool does not have support for 
C extension modules and is not operable 
as an interpreter. However, it uses Go’s 
garbage collection for object lifetime 
management and has the potential to 
scale more smoothly over Cpython.
Google does not seem set to leave 
Python at this moment. Instead, Grumpy 
is being backed to bring out a model of 
‘Python in Go’ and enable interoperability 
in its major Python developments.
In the near future, Google is 
expected to improve Grumpy and will 
soon convert some of its major Python 
code into a Go program using the latest 
model. The present release has some 
areas for improvement around built-in 
types and functions. Also, the hybrid 
approach is yet to be supported by a 
large number of Python developers.

Ford and Toyota among global 
auto giants promoting open 
source software
In what appears like a move against 
Apple and Google, Ford and Toyota have 
established a non-profit organisation. 
The new development is aimed at 
promoting open source software and 
delivering smartphone connectivity on 
future vehicles.
Called the SmartDeviceLink Consortium, 
the organisation includes automakers 
Mazda Motor Corporation, PSA Group, 
Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki Motors 
in addition to Ford and Toyota. There are 
also suppliers like Elektrobit, Luxoft and 
Xevo. Further, Panasonic, Pioneer and 
QNX are also set to join the board. All 
these entities have apparently combined 
to rival Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s 
Android Auto.
“Connectivity between smartphones 
and the vehicle interface is one of the 
most important connected services. Using 
SmartDeviceLink, we can provide this 
service to our customers in a safe and 
secure manner,” said Shigeki Tomoyama, 
president of Toyota’s Connected Company, 
in a joint statement.
SmartDeviceLink offers developers an 
easy way to integrate their app’s functions 
with in-vehicle technology like vehicle 
display screen, steering wheel controls 
and voice recognition. The Consortium 
expects that industry-wide adoption of 
the SmartDeviceLink platform will give 
developers ‘broad scale’ and expand their 
app interfaces. The initial technology 
under SmartDeviceLink is based on 
Ford’s AppLink, which was released 
to the open source community back in 
February 2013. This open source project 
will be managed by Ford-owned Livio.
Apart from the technical challenges, the cleanliness app is facing a significant issue 
in attracting people from the Indian region. “There has been no major success so 
far in terms of the audience. We have only received minor traffic and some sessions 
so far,” Badami acknowledged.
Going forward, Badami and his team, which includes his friend and co-
developer Rahul Lama, are set to release a mobile version of the My Clean India 
app. There are also some plans to release the application’s features via an API.
Badami told Open Source For You that he is in talks with some organisations 
to expand the usage of his app. This would encourage more users to bring about 
cleanliness across the country.
Latest Linux kernel improves support for 
AMD Radeon graphics
The open source community has received Linux 4.9.2 as the latest kernel. This new 
Linux version has come with improved support for AMD Radeon graphics and 
includes various performance improvements.
Linux maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman revealed in an email announcement 
that Linux 4.9.2 includes 141 file updates. To be precise, there are 1,031 insertions 
and 438 deletions.
The update has added better support for AMD Radeon HD 8000 series. Also, 
there are tweaks for Nouveau, Intel i915, InfiniBand, DVB, MMC, SCSI, thermal, 
staging and TTY drivers. The Linux kernel additionally comes with bug fixes for 
Atheros and Realtek hardware.
You can download Linux 4.9.2 by visiting kernel.org. Arch Linux and 
many other Linux distributions are likely to receive the newest update in 
the coming days.
The fresh Linux kernel emerges just after Kroah-Hartman announced the end-
of-life-cycle for Linux 4.8 systems. The Linux team is seemingly promoting and 
encouraging its users to opt for the Linux 4.9 series, over its predecessors.
GitHub tool to search encrypted keys goes public
A tool that has been designed to find encrypted keys on GitHub is now available 
online. Called TruflleHog, this tool obtains results from Git repositories. “It 
searches through Git repositories for high-entropy strings, digging deep into 
commit history and branches,” reads the description of TruffleHog on GitHub.
To bring out results, TruffleHog enters into the commit 
history of each branch, checks each diff from commit and 
evaluates the Shannon entropy. It assesses both the base64 
char set and hexadecimal char set for every blob of text 
greater than 20 characters of each diff. If a high-entrophy 
string is found to have less than 20 characters, the tool 
automatically prints the string to the screen.
Based on Python, TruffleHog uses the GitPython 
library to investigate diffs from commits. The same 
module is reportedly being used to search GitHub for private 
keys related to Amazon Web Services.
Microsoft enhances Bash on Windows to attract Linux fans
In 2016, Microsoft designed its Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in the form 
of a Bash to deliver a partial open source experience. But just months after its 
original release, the proprietary tool has now received a major update to bring a 
complete Linux flavour right to your Windows 10 system.
www.OpenSourceForU.com | OPEN SOURCE FOR YOU | FEBRUARY 2017 | 7

FOSSBYTES
With the release of Windows Insider build 15002, Microsoft has brought about a 
large number of changes to its Bash, a.k.a. Linux command line interface. “A long 
list of improvements and fixes for Bash/WSL arrived in this build, resulting in 
even more compatibility, performance and stability of your favourite Linux tools 
and technologies,” wrote Rich 
Turner, senior program manager, 
Microsoft, in a blog post.
Through the latest release, 
all Bash sessions were created at 
the same permission level, and 
admin and non-admin consoles 
were restricted to operate 
simultaneously. Additionally, there 
are features such as the logging 
function and fixes for the truncated 
Windows path in WSL to mesh Linux with Windows 10.
The updated Bash on Windows comes with support for kernel memory over-
commits. The way the process commit is calculated during a process fork has also 
been tweaked. Further, Microsoft has fixed the error code generation and enhanced 
VPN access through the command line tool.
While the latest Windows Insider preview brings about several enhancements, 
it also addresses some widely known issues on Bash. You are no longer able to use 
Ctrl-C in a Bash session. Turner stated that the console and Bash work just like two 
trains running on different tracks. Hence, the Ctrl-C command is now incompatible 
with Windows’ Bash.
Bash is one of the first major developments by Microsoft to step into the world 
of open source. Debuted back in April 2016, the command line tool runs a standard 
Ubuntu distribution. It is available through Windows Insider releases.
Renault leverages open source to build electric car projects
Renault has announced its partnership with entities including OSVehicle, ARM, 
Pilot and Sensoria to develop its open source-powered electric car projects. At 
Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017, Renault-Nissan Alliance chairman and 
CEO, Carlos Ghosn, showcased a prototype of the ongoing developments.
Based on the existing electric car model Twizy, Renault has developed its very first 
open source model called POM. This new vehicle will be initially available to startups, 
independent laboratories, researchers and private customers. The French automaker has 
also allowed third parties to copy and modify the software behind the latest solution to 
develop customisable electric vehicles.
“Sharing common hardware platforms with everyone is a new co-creative and 
horizontal approach that can disrupt this industry, significantly lowering costs and 
time-to-market,” said Tin Hang and Yuki Liu, founders of 
OSVehicle, in a joint statement.
In addition to the open software approach 
through OSVehicle, Renault’s partnership with 
ARM will make the Twizy software and 
hardware architecture public. The ARM 
ecosystem for advanced vehicle technology 
includes support for ADAS (advanced 
driver assistance system), IVI (in-vehicle 
infotainment), autonomous driving, 
advanced cockpits and connected cars.
VMware joins Open-O to 
construct NFV future
VMware has joined the Linux 
Foundation-backed Open-O project to 
map the future of network functions 
virtualisation (NFV). The new 
development is aimed at bringing open 
standards-based orchestration to NFV 
infrastructure.
Joining the Open-O project as a 
platinum member, VMware will work 
with the government board as well 
as participate in its technical steering 
and marketing committees. The Dell 
subsidiary will also help enhance 
open standards-based orchestration 
in the networking world. “By joining 
Open-O, VMware is extending its 
position as a major player in defining 
the evolution and adoption of NFV 
by telcos and communications service 
providers,” said Gabriele Di Piazza, 
vice president of solutions, Telco NFV 
Group at VMware.
The addition of VMware to the 
board will enhance Open-N capabilities 
to meet the demand for complex 
services over SDN (software-defined 
network) and NFV infrastructures, 
it is believed. “With the addition of 
leading NFV vendors such as VMware, 
we believe Open-O will successfully 
deliver the abstraction needed to 
deliver complex services over SDN and 
NFV infrastructures as well as legacy 
networks,” said Marc Cohn, executive 
director, Open-O and vice president of 
network strategy, the Linux Foundation.
The Open-O project has operators 
such as China Mobile, China Telecom 
and Hong Kong Telecom (HKT). 
There are also over a billion mobile, 
residential and business users who 
will all enjoy an advanced experience 
through NFV vendors like VMware.
Last year, the company hired 
Gabriele Di Piazza as vice president 
of its telco NFV division to start 
developing new strategies around the 
advanced network architecture.

Red Hat upgrades 
CloudForms with enhanced 
cloud support
Red Hat is upgrading the abilities of 
its hybrid cloud management offerings 
through CloudForms 4.2. The latest 
version expands support for multiple 
cloud platforms.
The mix of physical, virtual and 
cloud environments with container 
and micro-services demands different 
capabilities. Red Hat has addressed 
most of these through CloudForms 
4.2. Managing hybrid IT environments 
with Red Hat CloudForms is efficient 
and responsive. Also, organisations can 
save both time and costs by leveraging 
the significant improvements in the 
latest CloudForms.
Red Hat 
CloudForms 4.2 
enables hybrid 
cloud management 
on Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) 
through an Amazon EC2 image. 
The new release has enhanced the 
capabilities of OpenStack through 
improved tenant management as well 
as upgraded storage management for 
OpenStack objects. Likewise, there 
are improved chargeback capabilities 
for containers running on the Red Hat 
OpenShift Container Platform.
“There is no longer a ‘one-size-
fits-all’ IT environment, as many 
organisations are seeking to leverage 
the best benefits of physical, virtual 
and cloud-based technologies. 
Coupled with Linux containers, only 
managing one or two aspects of these 
hybrid computing environments can 
lead to downtime or outages,” said 
Joe Fitzgerald, vice president of 
management, Red Hat, in a statement.
CloudForms is based on the 
open source ManageIQ project. This 
development supports a wide range of 
platforms and can be customised for 
niche industries or organisations.
“The automotive industry will increasingly focus on the specific functionality that 
owners want, such as comfort levels and entertainment. By providing this platform, 
Renault is paving the way for innovation in these areas,” said Richard York, vice 
president of embedded marketing, ARM.
Qualcomm to help bring Meizu’s Android offerings globally
Settling the existing patent disputes, Qualcomm has reached a patent-licensing 
agreement with China’s Meizu. The latest development will help the chip 
maker expand its presence in the world of Android devices and take on Chinese 
competitors including MediaTek.
As per the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm has granted Meizu a worldwide 
royalty-bearing patent licence to develop, manufacture and sell devices with 
CDMA2000, WCDMA and 4G LTE technologies. The San Diego-headquartered 
company has assured that the latest partnership resolves all of its patent disputes 
with Meizu in China, Germany, France and the US. Besides, both the companies 
are set to “take appropriate steps to 
terminate or withdraw” their patent 
infringement litigation and other 
invalidity proceedings.
“Qualcomm is pleased to sign this 
licence agreement with Meizu, and 
to help enhance Meizu’s product line 
and generate strong growth for the 
company, both in China and globally,” 
said Alex Roger, president, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, in a joint statement.
Based in southern China’s Guangdong province, Meizu aims to counter home-
grown players like OnePlus, Vivo and Xiaomi. The company already has plenty 
of Android running options in its portfolio that would now be expanded across the 
globe. This is likely to give the company a boost in the European and US markets.
“We are confident that this cooperation with Qualcomm will add tremendous value to 
our users, channels, shareholders and employees,” stated Bai Yongxiang, president, Meizu.
With the latest deal, Qualcomm is reaching licensing agreements with as 
many as 10 of the largest Chinese smartphone companies. This demonstrates the 
domination of the chip maker in a market that once had Intel as an important player 
and has MediaTek as the next big name.
This latest development has emerged just a few weeks ahead of the Mobile 
World Congress (MWC) that will be held in Barcelona, Spain, in February 2017. 
Meizu is expected to unveil its Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered global offerings at 
this annual event.
Jove emerges as a replacement for Vim editor
Linux users already had some choices with regard to choosing an editor. But 
following the footsteps of Emacs, Jove 
has emerged the closest alternative to 
the iconic Vim editor.
Developed by open source 
contributor Jonathan Payne, Jove 
(Jonathan’s Own Version of Emacs) is 
a small yet powerful Emacs version. 
It is capable of handling your day-to-
day needs and comes with all built-in 
features that were previously available on Emacs.

FOSSBYTES
If you are a first time Jove user, you might feel that some functions are missing. 
It could either be because of Jove’s limitations or because you are not using Lisp 
anymore. However, this minimalistic utility tool is sufficient to make editing text 
much easier on Linux.
Jove offers customisations through some simple lines of code. Besides, it has 
the option to search all possible commands in an easy way. These features make the 
tool a good replacement for Vim.
Initially, the Jove package was available on Debian and Fedora. But you 
can rebuild its package to match your distribution. The package executive 
is 150K in size.
Shooter game Postal becomes open source after 
two decades of release
Ahead of reaching its 20th anniversary, Arizona based Running With Scissors has 
released the code of popular 
video game Postal. The isometric 
shooter game was released back 
in September 1997. “It was an 
instant hit, grabbing the attention 
of gamers, parents and politicians 
across the country, and we have 
been supporting and updating it 
ever since. But now, (almost) 20 
years later, we are entrusting our 
fans with the future of our game, by releasing its source code to the public,” the 
developer team at Running With Scissors wrote in a blog post.
However, this is not the first time that Postal has reached out to the open source 
community. Running With Scissors announced the release of its code in 2015 on 
the condition that it will port it to the Sega-made Dreamcast console. Later, its 
source code even reached a community developer who brought it to Linux for the 
OpenPandora handheld.
Developers can learn a lot from the open source release of Postal. Game 
developers can reuse the code in their own projects and build something iconic for 
the gaming world.
The source code of Postal is available on Bitbucket under the GPL2 license. It 
comes with the complete documentation to help you utilise the release effectively.
Facebook open sources its Atom tool
Facebook has released the code of its native Atom-based tool called Atom in Orbit. 
The latest development is aimed 
at providing developers a remote 
development environment that can 
run right in a browser.
Based on the Nuclide IDE, 
Atom in Orbit offers a standard 
user base and some extensions 
to help developers examine their 
code without any integrated 
development environment (IDE) 
on their desktop. The tool has the 
same keyboard shortcuts that were previously supported by Atom. This is a good 
experience for developers who are quite familiar with the open source desktop editor.
10 | FEBRUARY 2017 | OPEN SOURCE FOR YOU | www.OpenSourceForU.com

FOSSBYTES
Facebook product manager, Roy Zhang, lists several advantages of the Web 
based Atom. “While Web apps in general offer several advantages for engineers 
— for example, automatic backups, remote access and server-side processing, 
Atom on the desktop still enjoyed several features that were not available in the 
browser, such as synchronous access to the filesystem, access to local resources, 
natively implemented dependencies, access to native APIs and unrestricted 
access to the Internet,” Zhang said.
“During the hackathon, engineers found workarounds to these obstacles 
and contributed a set of scripts that repackaged Atom’s source so that it runs 
as a Web app,” he added.
Facebook is not the only tech giant that has worked on the concept of cloud-
based development environments for browser access. Google integrated Eclipse 
Orion within its Google Cloud Shell, while GitLab recently brought out a similar 
IDE through Koding cloud-backed IDE.
Facebook’s Atom in Orbit is certainly an advanced solution over the 
traditional Atom on the desktop. However, it comes with some challenges in 
the initial stages. Synchronous access to the filesystem via the fs module is not 
working on the browser version. Additionally, there is no access to native APIs 
and unrestricted access to the Internet.
You can access the code for Atom in Orbit from a GitHub repository. 
It also includes the necessary documentation to enable easy customisation 
of the original tool.
Oculus buys open source supporting, eye-tracking 
startup, The Eye Tribe
To expand its presence in the world of virtual reality (VR), Facebook-owned Oculus has 
acquired The Eye Tribe. The Danish 
startup is known for its eye-tracking 
hardware and is equally popular for 
open source software that has helped 
many developers build different eye-
tracking applications.
Founded back in 2011 by 
alumni of the IT University of 
Copenhagen, The Eye Tribe 
offers eye-tracking technology to 
developers. The startup also designs affordable eye trackers that would be the main 
point of focus for Oculus.
“The Eye Tribe intends to become the leading provider of eye control 
technology by licensing to vendors in the consumer technology industry,” stated 
The Eye Tribe on its official website.
The Eye Tribe was initially powering native hardware, but it recently extended 
its presence and started supporting some ongoing VR developments. At the Mobile 
World Congress last year, the company showcased its eye-tracking solution on 
Samsung GearVR. Alongside hardware, The Eye Tribe is enabling eye-tracking 
among various software solutions. The startup has its open source ITU Gaze 
Tracker framework that provides eye tracking over off-the-shelf components such 
as webcams and video cameras. This solution is touted to be the “most popular open 
source eye-tracking software” for developers.
This acquisition could set the tone for the next level of VR.
AMD, Mentor Graphics 
to design Linux based 
embedded solutions
AMD has decided to expand its strategic 
partnership with electronics design 
automation developer Mentor Graphics 
to reinforce the vision for Linux-based 
embedded solutions.
As per the terms of the agreement, 
AMD and Mentor Graphics will enable 
developers with some customised 
embedded Linux developments. These 
will include Mentor Embedded Linux 
Lite, Sourcery CodeBench Lite and 
Mentor Embedded Linux.
While the Mentor Embedded Linux 
Lite allows developers to evaluate 
and prototype future embedded x86 
processors without any charge, the 
Sourcery CodeBench Lite has the 
GNU-based C/C++ development and 
debug tool chain to offer custom Linux 
target platform development at no 
cost. There is also Mentor Embedded 
Linux with commercial terms for 
project development and Eclipse-based 
Sourcery CodeBench development 
environment, data trace analysis and 
visualisation capabilities.
“AMD’s portfolio of innovative 
embedded solutions, combined with 
Mentor’s long-standing leadership 
in open source software and tools, 
allows us to broaden our reach while 
effectively supporting a growing 
customer base, helping us to achieve 
continued success,” said Scot Morrison, 
general manager of the platform 
business unit, Mentor Graphics 
Embedded System division. Oregon-
based Mentor Graphics originally 
partnered with AMD back in 2014. That 
partnership was aimed at providing 
open source tools for building, 
debugging, analysing and optimising 
embedded software.
AMD is dedicatedly working to 
provide an embedded ecosystem to 
developers with options to select an 
ideal platform for specific solutions.

1.  Containers are becoming the de facto method for 
application deployment, moving away from virtual 
machines. Docker is a popular container application 
which most of you would be familiar with (https://
www.docker.com/). Docker is an open source project 
built on top of Linux containers, which allows 
applications to be isolated from each other.  Can you 
explain how Docker differs in providing isolation 
to applications as compared to virtual machines?  
Can you compare the two methods of application 
deployment, namely, hosting an application on a 
VM vs hosting it on a container, with regard to the 
following criteria: (a) security, (b) isolation, (c) cost, 
and (d) fine grained resource control and sharing.
2. When we input a query into a search engine such 
as Google, we get an ‘auto complete’ suggestion 
for that query, based on past queries that have been 
tried on the search engine. Can you explain how 
you would design an auto-complete mechanism 
that would scale well across the millions of queries 
that can happen concurrently at a time? What is 
the data structure that you would use to store past 
queries and automatically provide suggestions? 
Would you store the complete query as is, or would 
you break it into its constituent words?  Given 
that scalability and correctness is the key to this 
problem, can you explain how the choice of your 
data structure will address both? 
3. In information retrieval, you are given a set of 
documents and a query. You are asked to retrieve 
the set of documents that are most relevant to the 
query.  Many of the common information retrieval 
techniques are built around the measure of TF-
IDF, where TF stands for the term frequency, i.e., 
the number of times a query keyword appears in a 
document.   For example, given the query ‘Mahendra 
Singh Dhoni’s test match appearances’, I am asked 
to find all the documents relevant to it.  It is obvious 
that one can compute the Term Frequency for the 
query terms, and return a ranked list of documents 
in which the query terms appear most frequently. If 
this suffices to return the most relevant documents, 
why do we need the measure of Inverse Document 
Frequency (IDF)?  Can you illustrate, with an 
example, why IDF is needed in information retrieval? 
If you ignore IDF for relevant document retrieval, 
would it impact the precision or recall, or both?
4. With elections coming around in five Indian states, 
poll predictions have become quite a hot topic. 
However, there have been mixed results for poll 
predictions. For instance, the past year has been 
quite unsuccessful for many of the data scientists 
who are into poll prediction. Neither Brexit nor 
Trump’s victory were anticipated by most pollsters. 
Given this context, you are asked to predict the 
party that will win the majority in each of the five 
states going to the polls in the coming months. For 
any prediction, you need to build models which can 
analyse the data and make the prediction. What are 
the various data inputs that you would be interested 
in getting?  Or, in simplistic terms, what are some 
of the obvious features that you would like to 
extract from the data for winning party predictions 
in a state election?  Is this a classification problem 
or a clustering problem?  Why do you think poll 
prediction is a hard problem? 
5. You are given a set of documents and asked to 
perform clustering of these documents based on 
document level similarity.  You are familiar with 
different clustering algorithms such as ‘kmeans’, 
so you are confident that you can do the task. 
However, the interviewer now adds a second part 
to the problem, wanting you to label the clusters. 
How would you generate labelled clusters? What are 
the means of generating meaningful labels for the 
clusters? Can the clusters be labelled after, prior to, 
or during the clustering process itself? Describe your 
choice of solution and why you made it. 
In this month’s column, we discuss a few computer science interview questions.

6. You are given a set of articles and asked to identify the key 
phrases corresponding to each of the articles. Assume that 
each article is written in English and contains approximately 
10,000 words. You are asked to find up to seven key phrases 
for each of the documents.  How would you design a 
solution for this problem? Would you propose a supervised 
or unsupervised learning method for this problem? Justify 
your choice in terms of its advantages and disadvantages.  
Now you are told that each of the articles has a fixed 
structure with components such as an abstract, introduction, 
description, results and conclusion. How would you use this 
information in your solution? 
7. Consider the above question. Now you are told that 
you are given a black box algorithm which can do topic 
modelling for a set of documents. How can you use this in 
your solution for identifying key phrases?
8. Word embedding and sentence/paragraph embedding 
have become popular of late with the arrival of Google’s 
word2vec package. Can you explain the intuition behind 
embedding?  Given a corpus of documents, can you explain 
briefly how one could generate word embedding?  Given 
a set of word embedding that has been generated using a 
large corpus such as Wikipedia, can you explain how it can 
be used in different Natural Language Processing tasks?  
What is the major advantage of embedding representation 
over other forms of representation such as the count based 
co-occurrence matrix?
9. Geo-spatial applications are getting developed in large 
numbers these days. Consider a taxi-fleet management 
company for which the trajectories of its taxis need to be 
stored in a database. Spatial applications should be able 
to query the database for a specific trajectory or segments 
of a trajectory. It should be possible to answer queries of 
the form, where given a set of location points, it should 
be possible to retrieve all the taxis whose trajectories had 
overlapped at the location points. What kind of database 
would you use for storing trajectory data? To speed up 
query performance, what kind of indexing would you 
perform for trajectory data?
10. You are given an array A of N integers. You are also 
given a number X. You are asked to find the element in A 
that is closest to X. You are given the constraint that you 
should not sort the array A. (a) Can you write a C program 
to solve this problem?  (b) If you are told that the set S 
consists of floating point values instead of integers, how 
would you modify your solution for (a) to solve (b)?
11. You are given two arrays and asked to find the common 
elements between them.  (a) Assume that the two arrays 
only contain integer elements. (b) Assume that the two 
arrays contain floating point values. Would your solution 
for (a) work for (b) as well?
12. For dengue fever, a diagnostic test has been developed. The 
new test is 81 per cent reliable (i.e., it misses 19 per cent 
of cases where the patient actually has the disease).  It can 
wrongly label a patient as having dengue fever in 10 per cent 
of cases when the patient actually does not have the disease.  
You are told nothing about the patient’s symptoms or any other 
clinical information, except that the patient has tested positive 
for the dengue diagnostic test. Can you figure out whether the 
patient actually has the dengue illness from the above given 
information?  If yes, how? If not, why is that so?
13. We are all familiar with different sorting and searching 
algorithms.  However, these algorithms typically are designed 
for data that fits in physical memory. Consider that you are 
given two matrices A and B of dimensions MXN and NXR.  
The matrix dimensions are such that neither of the matrices will 
fit in the main memory. You are asked to write an algorithm for 
multiplying the two matrices and storing the result into a matrix 
C of dimensions MXR on disk. Can you outline the approach 
you would take for minimising the number of disk accesses 
that your matrix_multiply function would perform?  Now 
consider the same problem mentioned in question (1) above. 
You are told that matrices A and B are such that most of their 
elements are zero.  You are again asked to compute the matrix 
multiplication of these two matrices. Can you come up with an 
algorithm which minimises the number of disk accesses?
14. Consider that you are running your application on a desktop 
which has 16GB physical memory and has the Linux 
operating system installed on it. You want to determine the 
maximum memory footprint of your application. Explain 
how you will find out how much physical memory is being 
used by your application?
15. You are running a server application which is latency sensitive. 
You want to ensure that the virtual address space of the server 
process is locked into physical memory (essentially, none of 
its pages should be paged out). How would you ensure this?  
Assume that during the course of its run, the server application 
can map further memory pages by dynamic memory 
allocations or through mmap call. You need to ensure that 
any future pages mapped by the server also remain locked in 
physical memory. Explain how this can be achieved.

This month we explore a multi-agent programming environment 
which simulates natural and social phenomena. NetLogo can 
simulate complex systems that develop over time. By giving suitable 
programming instructions to ‘agents’, modellers can explore the 
connection between the micro-level behaviour of individuals and the 
macro-level patterns that emerge from their interaction.

‘turtles’. There are many turtles/
agents and they interact with 
each other. The surprising thing is that 
the seemingly complex, intelligent 
behaviour of many such agents can 
be modelled by remarkably simple 
interactions between them (for 
example, how migrating birds fly 
in the V-formation). NetLogo is a 
tool to help you model and study the 
complex behaviour that originates from 
The code to achieve consists merely 
of the delay between two successive 
ants leaving the nest and each 
ant, other than the leader, moving 
towards the previous ant. If the 
delay is just 1 unit, the ants follow 
almost the same path as the leader. 
If the delay is 3 units, the path is 
close to a straight line.

NetLogo is also a visual 
environment in which you create a 
number of turtles of multiple breeds, 
e.g., wolves and sheep, and study 
the dynamics of the world based on 
simple rules.
Its user interface consists of three 
tabs—interface, information and code.
A model requires two functions—
Setup and Go (the names are just a 
convenient convention), which are 
created as buttons on the interface tab. 
 
Setup is the function you write to 
initialise and set up the world.
 
Go is the function that is executed 
at a time interval. You can set the 
option for it to run forever.
The code for the functions is 
written on the code tab. You may 
provide information about the model in 
the information tab. 
The evolution of the world when 
you click the Go button is also shown 
on the interface tab.
The best way to learn NetLogo is 
to study the models that are included in 
the distribution.
An example is a line of ants. The 
leader ant moves towards the food 
using random movements; however, 
the ants that follow move in a line! The

Given the interest in weather change, 
you may be interested in the earth science 
models. Some of the results would 
seem very reasonable; for example, the 
spread of a fire in a forest depends on the 
density of the trees. However, the non-
linear increase in the extent of damage 
is disconcerting. The simple model just 
looks for a tree in the vicinity of each 
burning tree to determine whether the 
fire will continue or stop.

not very obvious to me was that of the

wandering randomly. If it bumps 
into a wood chip, it picks the 
chip up, and continues to wander 
randomly. When it bumps into 
another wood chip, it finds a 
nearby empty space and puts its 
wood chip down. With these simple 
rules, the wood chips eventually 
end up in a single pile. 
The true benefit of NetLogo 
and similar tools lies in modelling 
strategies before implementing 
policies and, hence, minimising 
adverse side effects. For example, it 
would make sense to first evaluate 
the implications and risks of an HR 
policy on increments and promotions, 
and study its effect on productivity, 
attrition, cooperation, etc, before 
implementing it.

Overview
The future of open source in the country is bright, backed by the Indian 
government’s Digital India initiative and the announcement of its Open Source Policy. 
Let’s take a look at the main reasons that have led to this promising scenario.
The Rise of Open Source in India
training – they scan the source code or tap into the always-
awake developer community,” he adds.
Dalpati of Alef Mobitech says that many domestic 
companies in India have 
started encouraging developers 
to participate in the community 
and contribute to the existing 
code base. “Indian companies 
are majorly encouraging 
developers to contribute to 
the open source community 
so that more and more users 
start using the open source 
applications or frameworks 
and, in turn, help in improving 
software development,” 
Dalpati asserts.
Open source developers are in demand
Contribution to open source communities helps young 
developers even land their dream jobs. Aitken states that 
Wipro and many of its clients look for open source talent. 
“We are looking for developers with the skills and mindset 
to be open source developers. Moreover, the demand for 
good open source developers will far outstrip supply for at 
least the next five years,” he proclaims.
Wipro claims it is the first global systems integrator 
(SI) to establish a defined open source practice. This has 
enabled the company to engage directly with the open 
source community and build solutions such as Galaxia 
and BDRE.
Bruno Lowagie, founder of iText, who has been an 
influential speaker at various tech conventions, states, “Indian 
developers are not only into open source, but they are also 
very open themselves.” 
Ramakrishna Rama, director of software engineering, 
Dell, notes that open source is helping young Indians translate 
their innovative ideas and technologies into reality. “Since 
India is a young country and has a large base of technically 
skilled professionals, open source creates a great opportunity 
and enhances their full potential for translating ideas and 
technologies into reality,” he says.
Leapfrogging to bigger applications
IT research analysts forecast that open source will leapfrog 
into areas such as transportation, smart cities and agriculture 
in the near future.
I
ndia is no longer just a nation of diverse cultures and 
languages, but has also become a huge market for software 
and various technology offerings – ranging from operating 
systems and productivity 
tools, to desktop servers 
and cloud solutions. Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi 
intensified these tech-focused 
developments by launching 
his flagship 'Digital India' 
campaign in July 2015. 
Andrew Aitken, general 
manager and global open 
source practice leader, 
Wipro, believes that open 
source is rapidly gaining 
popularity in India through 
the adoption practices of numerous government agencies, 
small and large businesses, and individual developers. “Part 
of this is due to its perceived cost advantages and the fact that 
Indian GSIs (global systems integrators) are supporting many 
offshore clients with large open source projects. Many Indian 
schools and academies are also teaching open source as a 
regular part of their technical curriculum,” Aitken told Open 
Source For You.
One of the major factors behind the success of open 
source in India is its ease of deployment. “There are as 
many deployments of open source as there are of proprietary 
software nowadays,” says Adnyesh Dalpati, director – 
solution architect and presales, Alef Mobitech.
Anant Kumar, head of product engineering and IT, 
Bharti Airtel, also acknowledges the ease of switching to 
open source. “It is easier to deploy open source technologies 
compared to proprietary ones as these are meant for 
specific use cases,” Kumar says, citing the availability of 
documentation and community support as the other key 
benefits of opting for open source.
A democratic way of software development
Experts believe that young developers often get attracted 
towards open source due to its democratic nature. Open 
source has evolved from the era of GNU and the free software 
movement that began in the late 90s and early 2000s.
“Young developers are biased towards action,” says 
Monojit Basu, founder and director, TechYugadi IT Solutions 
and Consulting. “Open source enables them to jump into 
coding and developing solutions faster. They do not wait for

source solutions. “We will soon see VC support for open 
source adoption cases, as in the Silicon Valley, to advance the 
existing community culture,” he says.
Airtel's Kumar considers open source technology as the 
great saviour for enterprises, which helps them achieve their 
goals at a much lower cost than proprietary solutions. This is 
a significant reason for entrepreneurs in the country to opt for 
open source today. “The open source ecosystem has evolved 
as many companies have started giving enterprise support to 
open source technologies like MongoDB, Neo4j, Orient and 
MariaDB, among others,” Kumar says.
In April 2015, the Modi-led government launched the 
much awaited Open Source Policy to boost community 
solutions in the country. The policy mandates that state-
run departments have to use open source for their software 
applications and services. And it encourages Indian 
developers who are building native solutions.
“Many projects are already in the process of adopting 
home-grown open source solutions like Bharat Operating 
System Solution (BOSS). The government is on the right 
path, and its Digital India initiative and the Open Source 
Policy will strengthen open source adoption in the coming 
years,” says Naiya.
Training is the need of the hour
A comprehensive training model for participating in 
community solutions is imperative to take India’s IT growth 
to the next phase. “For India to become a leader, its collective 
global systems integrator ecosystem must continue to focus 
on training and enablement,” says Aitken.
The race to get a highly-paid job has so far prevented 
Indian developers from participating in free open source 
development and from contributing to the community. But this 
is likely to be addressed with the adoption of some innovative 
approaches. “High competition amongst youth for employment 
was a major reason for low participation in non-paid open 
source development in India. However, with the rapidly 
growing startup culture in India, we have seen a fundamental 
cultural shift in the last six to eight years,” Naiya states.
The present education system in India needs to be upgraded 
to encourage innovation and contribution habits among the 
youth. This will ultimately bolster the growth of open source 
in the country. “Pure and proper development efforts in open 
source, irrespective of what the demand is, or how much would 
be paid, is vital for the Indian market,” says Prasad.
All in all, it can safely be said that open source is growing 
in India and will make the domestic market a behemoth 
even amongst developed open source markets, once issues 
like better training and greater participation in community 
solutions are addressed. 
“A developing country like India, where the service 
industry is the base of the economy, is in a better position 
to benefit from the open source ecosystem. Open source 
will be leapfrogging to bigger and more core areas like 
transportation, smart cities, agriculture and renewable energy 
at a later stage,” says Pavel Naiya, senior research analyst, 
Counterpoint Research.
Pankaj Prasad, principal research analyst, Gartner, also sees 
the growth in various open source developments across India. 
“Open source is spreading widely, and the spectrum of open 
source is expanding and pointing towards growth,” he says. 
“There are vendors who are leveraging open source and being 
very innovative,” Prasad adds.
Soon to surpass growth records of  
developed markets
Open source developments in India are already growing 
unprecedentedly. And now, the Indian region aims to surpass 
the open source activities of some major developed markets 
like the US and UK.
Experts consider it as an uphill task to imitate a developed 
model. However, there is a need to bring a localisation flavour 
to move ahead triumphantly. “India is at an early stage of 
open source development, and it will be an uphill task to 
build a similar ecosystem like what exists in the US,” Naiya 
of Counterpoint Research says. “The target should not be to 
compete against any country or ecosystem. Rather, the focus 
should be to develop local solutions solving local problems, 
which will eventually be a part of global open source projects 
serving communities for the betterment of everyone,” he adds.
Prasad of Gartner believes that the lag in the growth 
of open source developments can be overcome with faster 
adoption of evolving technologies in the Indian market. “Open 
source is going hand-in-hand with evolving technologies. 
Thus, we need to take a look at both aspects to reach the 
growth levels of matured markets,” says Prasad.
Wipro's Aitken thinks that despite the slow adoption of 
open source in India compared to major European and US 
regions, it has already made ‘huge strides’ in the recent past. 
“We see that pace only increasing,” Aitken says, adding, “With 
India's focus on becoming a world-class software development 
country, I believe it will soon become one of the leaders in the 
open source ecosystem.”
Enterprise developments at a fast pace
Among other sections, enterprises have started sharpening 
their focus on open source adoption. This will help India 
reach the next level of growth. “In the past, you had to start 
developing a new idea from scratch. Nowadays, you can get 
a headstart by leveraging open source tools and frameworks. 
This creates a new business reality in which India can play a 
great role,” says Lowagie.

detection and for log management purposes. It acts like an 
army commander and contains different tools like Snort, 
OSSEC, Squert, NetworkMiner, ELSA, etc, for defence.
Here is the link that you can download Security Onion from: 
https://securityonion.net/
4. OpenVAS
This is is a free and open source vulnerability managing 
and scanning suite. It’s a fork of the Nessus engine, which 
continues development on the open source project. It has a 
Web based dashboard. 
T
here are lots of tools available in the market to help 
individuals or network administrators secure their 
systems. Some tools are paid for, while others are free 
and open source. The tools given below are those that are 
FOSS based and highly popular because of their offensive or 
defensive capabilities.
People who want to learn ethical hacking can try some 
of these tools to find out the loopholes and vulnerabilities in 
their systems or networks. 
1. Nmap
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open source utility for 
network discovery and audit.  It is used to map your network 
and ports. It also has scripts that can detect network related 
issues. Nmap fetches raw data and determines the host type, 
OS type and hosts available in the network.

9. VeraCrypt
VeraCrypt is the free encryption utility available  to encrypt 
the file system.
Nowadays, we store our data in Dropbox, Google Drive 
and other cloud based software which guarantee privacy 
and security. But what if employees of those cloud services 
companies use that data for their own purposes? A better 
option is to encrypt those files/flash drives before dumping 
them into the cloud.
Here is the link to download this software:  
https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/
10. KeePass
KeePass is free and open source software to manage all your 
passwords in one place, securely.  Sometimes we use the 
same passwords for different accounts on different websites, 
which could lead to a serious problem. If someone cracks that 
password and has your user ID, then they will have access to 
your different accounts. Sometimes we also store passwords 
in browsers, which is also not a safe habit, as anyone getting 
access to your computer can see them. KeePass provides the 
best solution. Different passwords can be managed in one 
place with just one master password with an encrypted layer. 
All the passwords are unlocked by this master key and, at the 
backend, all the passwords are stored in a highly encrypted 
format by using the most popular and uncrackable algorithms. 
You can give it a try if you are tired of trying to remember 
passwords and want to store them securely.

H
acking has been part of computing for over five 
decades and is a very broad area, covering a range 
of tasks. The term hacker originated in 1960 at MIT. 
Hacking is regarded as a process of locating all possible 
back doors that exist in a computer system or network and, 
finally, intruding into it. In simple terms, it is regarded as an 
unauthorised activity to gain access to a computer system 
or network, to harm it or prevent its normal functions and to 
steal sensitive information available on computing systems. 
On the other hand, hacking can also be a legal activity 
when it is used to discover back doors and weaknesses in 
computer systems in order to patch them. This is called 
ethical hacking.
In today’s cyber world, lots of varied attacks occur 
every hour and are achieved by professional hackers, 
virus writers and crackers. The most basic tool required 
by every hacker is a hacking operating system. Usually, 
the operating systems specialising in hacking are based on 
the Linux kernel. These operating systems are regarded as 
advanced working systems, which include lots of ethical 
hacking and penetration testing tools.
In this article, the ten best operating systems used by 
ethical hackers and penetration testers are featured. All of 
them are free, open source, are based on the Linux kernel 
and are bundled with many hacking tools.

for FreeBSD servers. It is based on stateful packet filtering. It 
has a wide range of features that are normally only found in very 
expensive firewalls. Figure 1 lists a few features of pfSense.
ClearOS 
ClearOS is a powerful firewall that provides us the tools we 
need to run a network, and also gives us the option to scale up 
as and when required. It is a modular operating system that 
runs in a virtual environment or on some dedicated hardware 
in the home, office, etc. Solutions provided by ClearOS are 
described in Figure 2. 
ClearOS installation is very straightforward and painless. 
Once the installation is done and we’ve  got into the Web-
based administration system, we can easily familiarise

Shorewall
Shorewall is a popular Linux open source firewall, which is 
built upon the NetFilter system on Linux machines. It uses the 
iptables tool to access configuration files. It is a robust firewall 
system, which can be used over large networks. It is nothing 
but the command line environment which interacts with text 
configuration files. We can set the interfaces, the policies that 
apply to interfaces and the exception in policies by using the 
configuration files. Shorewall configures NetFilter using these 
configuration files with the help of the iptables utility.
Shorewall can be used on a standalone Linux machine, on 
a dedicated firewall system or as a multi-function gateway.
The features of Shorewall are illustrated in Figure 5.
Endian Firewall
Endian Firewall is a full-featured unified threat management 
solution, which uses the stateful packet inspection concept 
based firewall. It can be deployed as a proxy, gateway, and 
router with Open VPN.  
Figure 1: Features of pfSense
Figure 2: ClearOS solutions
Figure 3: IPFire
Figure 4: Smoothwall
IPFire 
IPFire is another open source Linux based firewall, which can be 
used by the SOHO segment. IPFire has implemented the stateful 
packet inspections firewall, which stores information about each 
connection. This will help to provide security over the network. 
It is very easy to manage, and is modular and highly flexible.
The features of IPFire can best be seen in Figure 3.
As IPFire uses stateful packet inspection, it can associate every 
packet’s transit to the connection. This information can be used 
to open the path for response packets automatically. The firewall 
figures out the rule for the opposite direction automatically.
Smoothwall 
Smoothwall is an open source Linux firewall that is very 
flexible. It has a Web interface named Web Access Manager, 
which is highly configurable. And it has a clean design that is 
easy to understand and manage.
Some of the features of Smoothwall are illustrated in Figure 4.
Other than the above features, Smoothwall also provides

VyOS is open source and completely free, and based on 
Debian GNU/Linux. It can run on both physical and virtual 
platforms. It provides a firewall, VPN functionality and 
software based network routing. It also supports paravirtual 
drivers and integration packages for virtual platforms. Unlike 
OpenWRT or pfSense, VyOS provides support for advanced 
routing features such as dynamic routing protocols and 
command line interfaces.
Its features are described in Figure 7.
UFW or Uncomplicated Firewall
UFW is iptables with less complexity and, hence, is more user 
friendly. It is the default firewall for Ubuntu servers. Creating 
an IPV4 or IPV6 host based firewall is also possible by using 
UFW, which provides a user friendly framework that helps us 
to manage command 
line interfaces and 
NetFilter. UFW also 
has a GUI interface 
along with the 
command line. The 
GUI tool of UFW is 
called GUFW, which 
makes working with 
the system simple.
The features of 
UFW are shown in

Overview
Here is a list of the ten most popular programming languages of 2016. Most of you might 
raise an eyebrow at the selection, wondering, ‘How is it possible to rank a programming 
language?’ Read on to know how the author has arrived at his choices.
The Top 10 List of  
Popular Programming Languages
ranking metric followed by TIOBE Index. 
The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings uses 
a programming language’s GitHub and Stack Overflow 
presence as a measure of popularity. Stack Overflow 
is a discussion forum for programming languages and 
GitHub is a code repository. In this ranking scheme, 
older languages or those with a small set of built-in 
library functions are at a disadvantage compared to newer 
languages and those with a large set of built-in library 
functions, especially while quantifying the presence in 
Stack Overflow. For example, an older language like C 
with a small set of library functions will be trailing behind 
newer languages like Python and JavaScript with a large 
set of library functions. 
The PYPL (PopularitY of Programming Language) 
Index uses the service of Google Trends to rank 
programming languages. The ranking is based on 
R
anking programming languages is a highly subjective 
and controversial topic. So in case you’re wondering 
how I came up with this list, let me explain. First 
of all, I have considered the four most popular rankings 
of programming languages, namely the TIOBE Index, the 
RedMonk Programming Language Rankings, the PYPL 
(PopularitY of Programming Language) Index, and the IEEE 
Spectrum Ranking of Programming Languages. 
The ranking metrics used by these four indexes vary 
considerably, so preferring one ranking over another is 
meaningless. TIOBE Index uses the search volume in popular 
search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo! and Baidu, and 
websites like Wikipedia, Amazon and YouTube as the criterion 
to gauge a language’s popularity. A programming language like 
C, which is widely studied in schools, colleges and universities, 
will have a clear advantage, while a language like Go, which 
is not popular with academia will be at a disadvantage with the

Overview
the number of searches for a tutorial of a particular 
programming language. The assumption is that the more 
tutorials searched for, the more popular the language is. In 
this ranking also, languages preferred by academia might 
have an advantage over languages preferred by industry. 
The IEEE Spectrum Ranking of Programming 
Languages has the most complicated ranking metric, 
which considers 12 factors from 10 sources. The 
10 sources are Google Search, Google Trends, 
Twitter, GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit, Hacker 
News, CareerBuilder, Dice and IEEE Xplore Digital 
Library. Even though the IEEE Spectrum Ranking 
of Programming Languages looks like the most 
comprehensive ranking mechanism, the most popular and 
oft-quoted ranking scheme is TIOBE Index. Figure 1, 
taken from www.tiobe.com, shows the long-term TIOBE 
Index rankings of various programming languages updated 
up to December 2016. 
Since each ranking scheme has a bias towards certain 
types of programming languages, selection based on a 
single ranking scheme will also be biased. So, for selecting 
languages I have considered all the four rankings, giving 
each equal weightage. Seven of the top 10 languages in all 
the four lists are the same. They are Java, C, C++, Python, 
C#, PHP, and JavaScript and so these languages have 
been included in my final list without much deliberation. 
The other three languages selected are Ruby, Go and 
Swift. They are in the top 20 of all the four ranking 
schemes. Ruby has two Top 10 finishes, whereas Go 
and Swift have one each. An additional selection criteria 
for Go and Swift is that both are gaining popularity and 
might be a permanent fixture in the top 10 list of popular 
programming languages in the near future, if not next year 
itself. So, the final list features Java, C, C++, Python, C#, 
PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Go and Swift.
Since this article is appearing in a magazine called 
Open Source For You, the programming languages 
selected must have an open source angle. So, it is time to 
check whether these languages have any relevance to the 
open source development community by defining open 
source programming languages. Software, of course, 
can be open source or proprietary but what about a 
programming language? After all, a programming language is 
just a set of standards and specifications. A cursory search on 
the Internet tells you that nobody has really bothered to define 
an open source programming language. Many have listed 
open source programming languages without mentioning 
the eligibility criteria. So, I had to device a mechanism to 
check whether a language is open source or not. I have used 
a very relaxed criterion for qualification as an open source 
language -- if there is a compiler or interpreter with an open 
source licence existing for a programming language, then 
that programming language is deemed open source. Even 
C# and Swift qualify as open source languages based on my 
definition of open source languages, which is not a strict 
definition of course, but more a starting point for discussion. 
Since my definition of open source languages is very 
liberal and inclusive,  I am further proposing a metric 
called the Openness Score for the list. This depends on the 
impact of a programming language on open source project 
development. For example, a language like Swift, which 
is not widely used to develop open source software will 
have a low Openness Score, whereas C will have a high 
Openness Score because it is used to produce a lot of open 
source software. If you really want to contribute to the 
open source community, then learn one of the languages 
with a high Openness Score. Before moving on to the next 
topic, I would like to express my personal opinion about 
the term ‘open source programming language’. I believe the 
term ‘open standard’ describes the status of programming 
languages better than the term ‘open source’.    
Now let’s continue with a discussion of the ten 
programming languages selected. The most important aspect 
regarding this discussion is analysing whether the popularity 
of a language is rising or falling. This definitely will help a 
lot of people to make educated guesses about which language 
to study next in order to make a difference in their career. 
Also, remember that the languages are being discussed in 
alphabetical order because it is not possible to rank them 
any further among themselves. This is because each of these 
programming languages is ranked differently in different 
ranking schemes. 
C 
C is a very popular programming language used for 
developing mobile, enterprise and embedded applications. 
It is a compiled language, which follows the imperative 
programming paradigm. The epic growth of C and UNIX is 
written on the same pages of history. C and Linux also have 
a very tightly knit relationship. Both are so connected that if 
you have to designate just a single programming language as 
open source, then there is no doubt that C is that language. 
The sad news regarding C is that in two of the rankings, it 
ranks low and in case of the TIOBE Index, though placed 
second, it had a huge drop in the ratings in 2016. But the 
IEEE Spectrum Ranking has placed C at the top. So, it is

Overview
premature to write an obituary for C, but if you are in the 
industry and a master of C alone, then things might get 
rough for you in the future. 
With seven of the top ten languages belonging to the 
C-family of programming languages, C will forever be the 
favourite of those in academia as the first programming 
language taught. The seven programming languages in this 
list that belong to the C-family are C, C++, C#, Go, Java, 
PHP and Swift. The three open source compilers of C for 
the Linux platform are gcc, clang and pcc. C is used in the 
development of the Linux kernel and open source software 
like Mozilla Firefox, Wireshark, MySQL, Android, 
Blender, GIMP, Mozilla Thunderbird, VLC Media Player, 
VirtualBox, CMake, MariaDB, PyGTK, SciPy, MongoDB, 
PHP, etc. So, with this history of prolific open source 
development, we can safely conclude that C has a high 
Openness Score. 
C++
C++ is also a programming language used for developing 
mobile, enterprise and embedded applications. C++ is a 
compiled language with imperative and object-oriented 
features. In the beginning, C++ was just a version of C 
with built-in support for classes and objects. But over the 
years, C++ has become mature and independent, becoming 
widely used in the industry. The ranking of C++ has 
stabilised over the years, and it regularly features among  
the top five in most lists. The popularity of C++ dropped 
marginally in recent years but is not significant enough 
to cause alarm. A very popular open source compiler of 
C++ for the Linux platform is g++. Some of the popular 
open source projects developed with C++ include Mozilla 
Firefox, MySQL, Android, Blender, LibreCAD, 7-Zip, 
Mozilla Thunderbird, Chromium, Wireshark, VLC 
Media Player, VirtualBox, Doxygen, CMake, MariaDB, 
Code::Blocks, SciPy, PHP and MongoDB. With so much 
open source software being developed with C++, we 
definitely can assign it a high Openness Score. 
C#
C# is a programming language 
developed by Microsoft. It is 
used to develop Web, mobile 
and enterprise applications. C# 
supports imperative, functional 
and object-oriented programming 
paradigms. Though there is some 
ambiguity, C# is considered a 
compiled language by most programmers. C# is still 
very popular with a top 5 finish in three of the four 
rankings. Its popularity has declined a bit in the past few 
years. But we still need to wait further to predict a clear 
trend regarding its waning popularity. Mono is an open 
source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework 
based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common 
Language Runtime. It is developed by Xamarin, a 
subsidiary of Microsoft. Due to the existence of the 
open source compiler Mono, C# can also be deemed as 
an open source programming language. Figure 2 shows 
the logo of Mono. C# is not heavily used in open source 
software development, featuring only in relatively minor 
projects like EasyERP, MixERP, uManage, ColorSharp, 
etc. So, we can assign a low Openness Score to C#. 
Go
Go is a relatively new programming language that 
made its first appearance in 2009. It is a compiled 
programming language created by Google. It is mainly 
used for the development of enterprise and Web 
applications. It supports concurrent and imperative 
programming paradigms. There are two open source 
compilers for Go, gc from Google and gccgo from 
GCC. gc is a cross-platform compiler and that makes 
Go a true open source programming language. The 
popularity of Go is increasing in all four of the 
rankings. If you really want to be a part of open source 
software development, then Go is the next language 
you have to learn. Docker is a popular open source 
software developed using Go. The file hosting service 
Dropbox, with free and proprietary components, is 
also developed using Go. So, we can safely assign it a 
medium Openness Score. 
PHP 
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language suitable 
for server-side Web development. It is an interpreted 
language with interpreters for almost all platforms. The 
existence of Zend Engine, an open source interpreter, 
makes PHP an open source programming language. 
PHP is still very popular with a Top 3 finish in two 
of the rankings. The popularity of PHP has also 
stabilised over the years and there appears no imminent 
threat to its position. PHP is extensively used in the 
development of open source projects like Drupal, 
Joomla, WordPress, Moodle, etc. PHP based open source 
project development is not nearly as pervasive as C or 
C++ based development, so we will assign it a medium 
Openness Score. 
Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, 
dynamic programming language. It is used for the 
development of enterprise and Web applications. It 
supports object-oriented, imperative and functional 
programming paradigms. An open source interpreter 
called CPython is the default reference of Python. 
So, Python can definitely be called an open source 
programming language. It is still very popular with Top

5 finishes in all the four rankings. Blender, Dropbox, 
BitBake, SageMath, YUM, OpenStack, Mercurial, 
Django, PyGTK, SciPy, etc, are some of the popular open 
source software developed with Python. Since Python is 
used so prolifically for open source project development, 
we can assign a high Openness Score to it.  
Java
Java is a concurrent, object-oriented, general-purpose 
programming language. It is a popular choice for the 
development of enterprise, mobile and Web applications. 
OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and 
open source implementation of the Java Platform Standard 
Edition (Java SE), and since version 7 onwards it is the 
reference implementation of Java. 
Java is an extremely popular programming language 
with the No. 1 rank in the TIOBE Index and PYPL 
PopularitY rankings and a No. 2 rank in the IEEE 
Spectrum and RedMonk rankings. Some of the open 
source software developed with Java include Android, 
Weka, Apache Tomcat, Qt, Eclipse, NetBeans and Apache 
Hadoop. Operating systems are usually developed using C 
or Assembly language, but Java has made its presence felt 
there also. Though not very popular, the operating system 
JNode is fully developed using Java. So, for Java also we 
will assign a high Openness Score. 
JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted 
programming language. It is the programming language 
of the Web. It supports object-oriented, imperative 
and functional programming styles. The V8 JavaScript 
Engine is an open source engine developed by the 
Chromium Project for the Google Chrome Web browser. 
JavaScript is another programming language whose 
popularity is increasing in all the four rankings, and 
that makes it another recommended language to further 
your career. Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, 
and MongoDB are some of the open source software 
developed with JavaScript. It has moderate importance 
in open source development and can be assigned a 
medium Openness Score.
Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, general-purpose programming 
language. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
including functional, object-oriented and imperative styles. 
Matz's Ruby Interpreter or Ruby MRI is the reference 
implementation of Ruby and uses the Ruby License, 
which is approved by the Free Software Foundation. The 
popularity of Ruby seems to be declining slightly over 
the years. What confuses me is the fact that though the 
rankings do not show any sinister decline in the popularity 
of Ruby, there are a lot of articles suggesting that it is dead 
or going to die shortly – this is a phenomenon I couldn’t 
comprehend, at least not with the data available. Popular 
open source projects developed using Ruby include Ruby on 
Rails, a server-side Web application framework and Merb, 
a precursor to Ruby on Rails. So, Ruby also has moderate 
open source relevance and can be assigned a medium 
Openness Score.
Swift
Swift is a general-purpose compiled programming 
language developed by Apple, mainly for the iOS and 
macOS platforms. It supports functional, object-oriented 
and imperative styles. The Integrated Development 
Environment for Swift is called Xcode, which is only 
a freeware using open 
source components. If 
it was the monkey that 
saved C#, for Swift the 
saviour is the dragon. 
Figure 3 shows the logo 
of LLVM, a very popular 
compiler infrastructure 
project; one of the Swift 
compilers is provided by LLVM. Since LLVM is open 
source software, Swift also qualifies as an open source 
programming language. As a side note, LLVM is an 
important open source project and the chief rival of 
GCC. If you find the time to explore LLVM, you will be 
rewarded. Calling Swift an open source programming 
language might be controversial but the language is 
gaining popularity in all the rankings and mastering 
it might be a wise decision. The Firefox iOS app, 
WordPress for iOS, etc, are some of the open source 
software written using Swift. The main problem with the 
open source projects developed with Swift is that most 
of them are built for the iOS or macOS platforms, which 
are tightly coupled with Apple products. Due to these 
reasons, we assign a low Openness Score to Swift.
So it’s time to conclude the article and wait for angry 
protests! I am sure I have left out some of your favourite 
programming languages from this list. But do remember that 
you cannot remove any of the above-mentioned languages 
from the list due to various reasons. Of course, I could have 
added more languages to the list, but then it won’t be a Top 
10 list, then, would it?

Overview
Before a Web app goes live, it is advisable to have it tested for any potential bugs. 
Various types of tests have to be made on the app to ensure that it performs as 
expected. This article covers the basic principles of Web app testing and gives the 
reader a glimpse of the top five open source apps in this space.
Top Five Open 
Source Tools 
for Optimising 
Web Apps
testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance 
testing ensure that the application addresses all the specified 
needs. Load testing and performance testing are also 
performed by creating different virtual users to ensure that 
the application gives optimised performance under heavy 
load conditions, ensuring that it is not affected by any 
parameter. The important aspects that are considered during 
the evaluation of any Web application are:
1. Validation of the Web link, with which the Web app can 
be accessed by users, as well as of different links that help 
users to switch from one page of the Web app to the other.
2. The look and feel of various GUIs present in each tab of 
the Web app.
3. The functionality of different GUIs present in each tab of 
the Web app.
4. Database testing for the database accessed by the Web 
application in order to ensure that the data fetched by the 
application is valid and correct.
5. Performance of the Web app on different browsers.
6. Evaluation of the other performance parameters of the 
A 
huge discount at any online shopping portal invites 
us to look around for bargains. Having chosen a 
stylish T-shirt (with the ‘50 per cent OFF’ tag), we 
click on ‘Make Payment’ only to find a message stating, 
‘Not in stock’.The slow working of web application under 
heavy load due to which stock got over by the time we could 
make payment disappoints us greatly. This would not have 
happened if the shopping portal had undergone proper load 
testing and performance testing. Such issues can be observed 
in other Web applications too, if their performance has not 
been evaluated and optimised properly.
Web applications follow the SDLC (software 
development life cycle) process right from the requirements-
gathering phase to their development, and then on to 
the testing phase until the final application is ready for 
deployment in production. Testing is one of the most 
important phases of the SDLC. During this phase, the 
developed Web application is tested against the requirements 
mentioned in the SRS (software requirements specifications) 
document. Various types of testing, such as functional

fetched by the application is what 
users need or asked for.
8. Every Web app developed needs 
to ensure its users are secure. It’s 
quite important to users that their 
data is secure and not accessible by 
anyone not authorised to do so. An 
open source tool like SOAPUI is 
good enough to evaluate the security 
parameters of any Web app.
9. Performance and load testing can 
also be performed using open source 
tools like JMeter, to ensure that the 
app does not crash under a heavy 
load and works as per the user’s 
expectations.
10. Detailed tracking and reporting 
of the test cases, whether these 
were passed or failed, as well as 
information about the bugs detected 
can also be retrieved using open 
source tools.
Top five open source 
tools for evaluating and 
optimising Web apps
Here are the best open source tools that are widely used to 
test and evaluate any Web application. 
Selenium
Selenium is an open source software testing framework 
designed for Web apps. It facilitates in authoring tests 
without even learning a test scripting language (Selenium 
IDE) by providing a record/playback tool. Selenium also 
provides a test domain-specific language called Selenese, 
due to which we can write tests in different popular 
programming languages like C#, Java, Groovy, Peru, 
Python, PP, Ruby and Scala. The automated tests can 
then be run against most of the modern Web browsers. 
Selenium can be deployed on Windows, Linux and OS X 
platforms. It is open source software released under the 
Apache 2.0 licence.
Supported scripting languages: Java, C#, Ruby, Groovy, 
PEEL, Python, PHP and Scala
Features:
1. Provides a record/playback tool to automate test suites.
2. Identifies components of the app using the properties of 
various elements.
3. Comprises the Selenium IDE, the client API, Web driver, 
the grid and remote control.
4. Commands generated in the Selenium IDE Table mode, 
also known as Selenium commands, are simple type or 
click-type commands.
Web application such as the login 
session, the app’s response  
time, etc.
7. Performance of the app when 
many users hit it simultaneously 
(load testing).
8. Security features of the app to 
ensure that the user’s data accessed 
by the app is secure.
Role of open source tools in 
optimising the performance 
of various Web applications
There are many considerations 
that software quality assurance 
engineers need to take into account 
and evaluate before giving a 
thumbs-up to any Web app. Since 
we are in an era of automation, a 
machine or system helps us do all 
our mundane manual activities. 
There are various open source tools 
that can be used to evaluate and 
optimise the performance of any 
Web application on the basis of the 
users’ requirements (and they let users 
know if improvements are required). Let’s look at how 
open source tools assist in optimising the performance 
of Web applications by first evaluating the apps and then 
removing the bugs discovered in the process.
1. An automation tool helps a tester in generating and 
executing different test cases and scenarios for the 
specific Web app under test.
2. A tester can even record various actions that need to be 
performed while validating any Web app in the form of 
code or script, and this can be executed while testing 
that scenario again during regression testing.
3. Developers of Web apps also need to perform unit 
testing, and this is done using different open source 
tools like Selenium, Watir, etc.
4. Open source tools like Selenium and AutoIt help in 
performing functional testing for any Web app by 
validating the features of different elements in the app.
5. Validation of the GUIs in different tabs or pages of a 
Web app needs to be done to check if these are visible 
in the required format, for which open source tools 
like AutoIt are apt.
6. Once different modules of the app are tested separately, 
they also need to be tested after integration; for this, 
integration or link testing for the complete app is done 
with different open source tools.
7. It’s even possible to fetch data from a specific database 
or data warehouse and perform validation on it using 
open source automation tools. This ensures that the data

5. Capable of capturing test items or objects, both with or 
without the X Path values.
6. Synchronises the script with the mouse and keyboard 
related commands.
7. Selenium Grid dramatically speeds up functional 
testing of Web applications by leveraging the user’s 
existing computing infrastructure. 
8. Allows different users to easily run multiple tests 
in parallel, on multiple machines or even in a 
heterogeneous environment.
9. Can be deployed on Windows, Linux and 
Macintosh platforms.
Watir
Watir (Web Application Testing in Ruby, pronounced 
‘water’ ) is a Ruby based automation tool for automating 
Web browsers. Watir was developed by Bert Petticoated 
and Paul Rogers. It actually drives an application on the 
Web in a manner that’s similar to how users do. It clicks on 
a browser, fills the form data, presses buttons, etc. It also 
checks results such as when any text appears on a page. It 
is quite simple and flexible. Using the Ruby programming 
language, Watir can even make a connection to the 
database and read files (.text, .ls, .XML, etc). Users can also 
create their own functions and library for reusable code.
Supported scripting language: Ruby
Features:
1. Test scripts in Watir can be written using Ruby, and 
it consists of a Ruby library which helps to simulate 
users’ action in the browser.
2. Is able to use the full power of Ruby to read the data 
from Excel files and write the data to Excel files or 
XML files in test scripts. 
3. Very popular among testers; hence, the community that 
backs it is growing.
4. Supports all Web apps, no matter what language these 
are developed in.
5. Supports multiple browsers and that too, on different 
platforms.
6. Powerful and easy to use, yet wonderfully lightweight.
SoapUI
SoapUI is the world’s most widely-used open source 
Web service testing application. It can test different 
Web services for service-oriented architectures (SOA) 
or representational state transfer (REST) APIs. It was 
developed by Liveware Software, which was later 
acquired by Smart Bear Software in 2011. SoapUI was 
initially released to Source Forge in September 2005. It 
is free software that is licensed under the terms of the 
European Union Public License (EU PL). It is developed 
entirely on the Java platform, and it uses Swing for the 
user interface. SoapUI is cross-platform and also supports 
Eclipse, IDEA and Net Beans. It can test SOAP and 
REST Web services along with JMS and AMF. SoapUI 
also provides extensive opportunities for scripting by 
using either Groovy or JavaScript (since Soap 3.0). 
Supported scripting languages: Groovy Script, JavaScript
Features:
1. Functional testing
a. Allows all testers to write functional API tests in SoapUI.
b. Supports the drag-and-drop feature.
c. Also supports test debugging and allows data driven test 
development.
d. Allows advanced scripting (code can be customised 
depending on the scenario).
2. Security testing
a. Capable of performing a complete set of 
vulnerability scans.
b. Prevents SQL injection in order to secure the databases.
c. Scanning performed for cross site scripting.
d. Also performs boundary scans and fuzzing scans to 
avoid erratic behaviour of the services.
3. Load testing
a. Distributes the load tests across different load agents.
b. Simulates high volume and real-world load testing.
c. Advanced customised reporting to capture different 
performance parameters.
d. Allows end-to-end performance monitoring of the 
system.
4 Supported protocols/technologies

Sahi
Sahi is an automation and testing tool for Web apps, 
available in an open source and proprietary version. The 
open source version includes all the tools required for most 
testing purposes, and is popular because it can be modified 
according to one’s needs. Sahi Open Source is written 
using Java and JavaScript and has been hosted on Source 
Forge since October 2005. It has been released under an 
Apache License 2.0 and its latest version is 6.1 (published 
on November 5, 2014). 
Sahi basically runs as a proxy server and the browser’s 
proxy settings are configured so that they point to Sahi’s 
proxy. Sahi then injects JavaScript event handlers into the 
Web pages, which allows it to record and then play back 
different events on the browser. Since Sahi uses the proxy to 
interact with different Web apps, it does not get affected by 
the browser on which that application is run. 
Supported scripting language: Sahi Script
Features:
1. Can test Web applications running on IE, Chrome, 
Firefox, Safari, Opera and any modern browser.
2. The record and playback feature is available on all the 
browsers that it works on. 
3. Generates output reports in HTML format whenever the 
script written is played back in order to test any action.
4. Can run a single test case or even suites of more 
than one test case at a time. It supports the batch-run 
process as well. 
5. One can even play back more than one test script in 
parallel, at the same time, using Saki.
Apache JMeter
The Apache JMeter is open source software designed 
as a 100 per cent Java app to test functional behaviour 
and measure performance. It was originally designed for 
testing Web apps alone but has since 
expanded to other test functions as 
well. Apache JMeter can be used to 
test performance, both on static and 
dynamic resources, including dynamic 
Web applications.
 It can also be used to simulate a 
heavy load on a single server, group 
of servers, network or even object—
to test strength and to analyse the 
overall performance under different 
types of load.
Supported scripting languages: Groovy 
and Bean shell script
Features:
1. Can help in performing load testing 
as well as performance testing of the following different 
applications, servers and protocols:
a. Web – HTTP and HTTPS (Java, PHP, NodeJS, 
SPINET, etc)
b. Web services – SOAP/REST
c. FTP and TCP protocols
d. Database via JDBC
e. Message-oriented middle ware (MOM) via JMS
f. Native commands or shell scripts
g. Mail – SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)
h. LDAP and Java Objects
2. Consists of Test IDE which allows fast test plan 
building, recording (from browsers or native 
applications) and debugging.
3. Can run in command-line mode (non GUI/headless 
mode) to load tests from any Java compatible OS 
(Linux, Windows, etc).
4. Easily portable and generates a complete and dynamic 
HTML report.
5. Its multi-threading framework allows concurrent sampling 
by many threads, and even simultaneous sampling of 
different functions using separate thread groups.
6. Helps in caching and offline analysis or in 
replaying test results.

Overview
The Internet of Things (IoT) is spread across various layers, with different 
types of software being used across them. This article presents a list of open 
source software packages which can be used in each of the layers.
Open Source Software  
You Can Use for IoT Development
pre-built tool chains as well as source code for Cortex-M 
and Cortex-R processors, especially for bare metal code 
for microcontrollers. It has consistent releases in every 
quarter. The latest stable release is 2016 Q4, which ships 
with gcc v6.2 and is migrated to 64-bit Linux hosts, whereas 
the previous release of 2016 Q3 ships with gcc v5.4 and is 
available for 32-bit Linux. The GNU ARM Eclipse project 
provides Eclipse CDT extensions and support for popular 
targets like STM32 F series boards, and FRDM Kinetis KL 
series boards with C/C++ templates, using this toolchain as 
the backend. Most of these elements are licensed under GPL.

Zephyr OS: This Linux Foundation Project is aimed 
at being a small, scalable, real-time OS for connected and 
resource-constrained devices, licensed under Apache 2.0. The 
Y
ou might have read Gartner and many other business 
forecasts on connected devices and IoT growth in the 
coming years. Billions of connected devices around 
us, as well as open hardware and software solutions, play a 
key role in enabling a smarter life in the near future. Before 
proceeding to the list of open source software in this field, 
let’s have a look at a few layers of the IoT architecture.
 
Layer 1 consists of end devices talking to the 
environment, which are also known as sensor nodes 
typically powered by microcontroller based targets, 
wearables and, sometimes, Linux boards.
 
Layer 2 consists of gateway devices, typically Linux 
powered target boards or handheld gadgets for interfacing 
end devices with cloud platforms and bridging protocols 
with their middleware support. High end microcontrollers 
with suitable frameworks can also be a choice here.
 
Layer 3 consists of servers, typically deployed on cloud 
platforms. They provide services like authentication, data 
collection, data processing, analysis, storage, visualisation, 
web integration, mobile app connectivity, etc. This may be 
further divided into various sub-layers or components.
Let’s examine some open source choices for development 
in each layer.

If you haven’t joined the Android app developer bandwagon yet, then welcome to 
App Inventor 2. If you are a first timer, we suggest you read our previous articles 
(which have been featured here for around a year now). If you’ve already got a few 
apps in your armoury, then good luck and carry on.
The theme of the application 
The theme is pretty simple -- we need 
to design and program the application 
so that it can convert one unit to 
another. Rather than doing single unit 
conversions, let’s give users options to 
pick from a range of alternatives.
GUI requirements 
For every application, we have a 
graphical user interface or GUI, 
which helps users to interact with the 
on-screen components. How each 
component responds to user actions is 
defined in the block editor section. 
GUI requirements for Screen1
1. Labels: The labels are the static text 
components used to display some 
headings or markings on the screen. 
2. Button: A button will let you 
trigger the event and is a very 
essential component.
3. Horizontal arrangement: These 
are special components which 
keep all child components aligned. 
Horizontal components keep all 
the child components horizontally 
aligned.
4. Notifier: This is used to display 
some instructions or control your 
existing components. You will see 
its functionality in more detail as we 
implement it in our app.
5. List picker: This is the GUI 
component which presents a list to 
users, who have to choose from the 
displayed options.
6. Input box: These dedicated user 
input boxes allow the user to type 
the input. During the designing 
stage, you can set the type of 
accepted input, e.g., numerical only, 
multi-line, etc.
Table 1 lists the components that 
we will need for this application. Let us 
drag them to the designer from the left 
hand side palette.
1. Drag and drop the components 
mentioned in the table above the 
viewer.
2. Visible components can be seen 
by you, while the non-visible 
components will be located beneath 
F
or the past year, we have 
embarked on a journey of 
developing apps using App 
Inventor. During this period, we 
developed multiple applications and I 
hope you have also experimented with 
things on your own. If your applications 
have been published in the Google 
Play store, I would like to check out 
your work; so please share your app 
download links via email.
In App Inventor, we have mastered 
the components available for use in the 
palette. Playing around with the designer 
and block editor is so much fun.
A unit conversion app or software 
is quite a necessity in our daily lives. 
There are multiple instances when we 
need to convert some unit to another 
and vice versa. The application comes 
handy for faster calculations. So 
let’s develop a simple, yet fun filled 
Android utility application. You have 
probably practised unit conversion 
in mathematical problems in school. 
In this article, we will revise your 
knowledge of units.

3. We have placed a label so as to 
name the application.
4. All buttons need to be put within 
the Horizontal arrangement so as to 
keep them aligned horizontally.
5. If you have dragged and placed 
everything, the layout will look 
something like what’s shown in 
Figure 1. 
6. Make the necessary property 
changes, like we did in changing 
the text property for the label and 
button components. Table 2 depicts 
this more clearly.
7. Renaming the components helps to 
identify them in the block editor.

If you are confused after looking 
at the designer and the components 
viewer, let me explain things a bit more. 
Here is the hierarchy that we have 
placed for our application.
1. At the top, we have the title for 
our application. It’s always a good 
practice to name your application 
and display it on the screen as well. 
We have put a label for that and 
have set its text property to the 
name of the application.

you remember how to switch from 
the designer to the block editor. There 
is a button available right above the 
Properties pane to do so.
Block editor blocks 
I have already prepared the blocks for 
you. All you need to do is drag the 
relevant ones from the left side palette 
and drop them on to the viewer. Arrange 
the blocks in the same way as shown in 
Figure 4. I will explain what each one 
does and how it is called.
The code blocks in Figure 4 depict 
what should happen when the weight 
check box is selected. It is obvious 
that, at one time, we will have only one 
type of conversion; so, if any of the 
other two are selected, they should be 
deselected. And, accordingly, we will 
be setting the values for the ‘From’ and 
‘To’ dropdown menus.
Figures 5 and 6 give the code for 
the other two check boxes.
Figure 3: Components view
Figure 5: Block Editor Image 2
Figure 6: Block Editor Image 3
Figure 4: Block Editor Image 1
2. Below that we have another label, 
which will work as a prompt for the 
user to select a conversion type from 
the available options.
3. Next, we have placed three check 
boxes in a row, putting them all 
within a horizontal arrangement. 
We will code them to work as the 
HTML radio button so that once a 
check box is selected, the other one 
is deselected automatically.
4. Then we have a list picker to select 
the input unit.
5. Within the user types, the input will 
be only numeric, as we have set the 
property of the text box to take only 
numeric inputs.
6. Another list picker will decide the 
output unit.
7. The Convert button will initiate the 
convert calculation and, depending 
upon the user inputs, it will display 
the conversion output to the 
dedicated label.
The block editor
Now let’s head towards the block editor 
to define its behaviours. So, what is the 
exact functionality that we expect from 
our application?
1. First, the user will select the type of 
conversion, i.e., whether it is weight 
conversion, length conversion or 
temperature conversion.
2. Depending upon the user selection 
for the check boxes, the list picker 
options should be populated.
3. Next, the user will provide the numeric 
input in the text box provided.
4. The user has to select the output 
conversion unit.
5. Upon clicking the Convert button, 
the output digit should be populated.
So let’s move on and add these 
behaviours using the block editor. I hope

As soon as the user has selected the 
drop down value, it should be reflected as 
the text value of the same. The code given 
in Figure 7 makes this conversion.
We want  the conversion to happen 
as soon as the button is pressed, but we 
also need to make sure that the users 
have provided all the necessary inputs, 
i.e., they should have selected at least 
one of the conversion modes, have 
selected the ‘From’ unit from the first 
drop down box, provided some input 
value in the input text box and, finally, 
given the conversion unit for the ‘To’ 
drop down box. Listed below are the 
validations for each case.
 
Checking the checkbox status 
(Figure 8).
 
Further checking whether or not the 
user has provided some input value 
(Figure 9).
If everything seems okay, the output 
value should be calculated (Figure 10).
Now we are done with the block 
editor too. Let us move to downloading 
and installing the app on the phone to 
check how it works.
Packaging and testing 
To test the app, you need to get it on your 
phone. First, you have to download it to 
your computer and then move it to your 
phone via Bluetooth or USB cable. I’ll 
tell you how to download it.
1. On the top row, clicking on the 
‘Build’ button will show you the 
option to download the APK to your 
computer.
2. You can watch the progress of the 
download and, after it is successfully 
done, the application will be placed in 
the Download folder of your directory or 
the preferred location you have set for it.
3. Now you need to get this APK file 
to your mobile phone either via 
Bluetooth or via USB cable. Once 
you have placed the APK file on your 
SD card, you need to install it. Follow 
the on-screen instructions to install 
it. You might get some notification 
or warning like, ‘Install from un-
trusted source’. Allow this from the 
Settings and after the successful 
installation, you will see the icon of 
your application in the menu of 
your mobile. This will be the default 
icon, and I will tell you how it can 
be changed as we move ahead.
As you can see, we have put 
in place the logic to convert units 
of weight. Now you need to think 
about the logic for the remaining 
conversions.
I hope your application is working 
exactly according to the specs you 
have given. Now, depending upon 
your usability and customisation 
requirements, you can change various 
things like the image, sound and 
behaviour too.
Debugging the application 
We have just created the prototype 
of the application with very basic 
functionality, but what else might the 
user be interested in? There are various 
Figure 7: Block Editor Image 4
Figure 8: Block Editor Image 5
Figure 9: Block Editor Image 6
Figure 10: Block Editor Image 7
use cases that require serious thought so 
as not to annoy the user. Consider the 
following use cases:
1. How will you code it to pick the 
conversion type and then apply the 
multiplication factor?
2. If there is more than one value in 
the drop down menu, how will the 
multiplication factor be decided?
3. What if the user doesn’t select the 
drop down value and it remains 
with the default ‘Select’ text?
These are some of the scenarios that 
might occur and users will be pretty 
happy seeing these addressed.
Think over all these scenarios— 
how can you integrate them into the 
application? Do ask me if you fail to 
accomplish any of the above use cases.
You have successfully built another 
useful Android app for yourself. Happy 
inventing!

Data visualisation is an inevitable task, considering the prolific growth in the volume 
and nature of data that applications need to handle. In such a scenario, presenting 
data in the form of easy-to-comprehend visual representations increases its value. This 
article provides an introduction to five data visualisation libraries of Python. 
Five Python Libraries that 
Make Data Visualisation Easy
The official documentation recommends the use of the 
Anaconda Python distribution to set up Bokeh effortlessly, 
using the following command: 
conda install bokeh
Nevertheless, Anaconda is not a mandatory requirement 
to install Bokeh. If the dependencies are satisfied, it can be 
installed using Pip as well. 
As stated earlier, making plots with Bokeh is very simple. 
The following code snippet is to build a simple line graph and 
render it in a browser: 
from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show
# 1. Load some data in X,Y variables
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [23, 15, 7, 12, 21]
# 2. Specify the name of the output HTML file
output_file(“lines.html”)
#3.  create a new plot with a title and axis labels
p = figure(title=”Bokeh Demo for OSFY”, x_axis_label=’x’, y_
T
he extensibility of Python is one of the main reasons 
for its popularity among developers from a wide 
spectrum of domains. Invariably, all of these domains 
handle large volumes of data, and presenting this data in an 
easy-to-grasp format has become a mandatory requirement. 
Python is loaded with options when it comes to visualisation 
of data. Some of them are listed in Figure 1.
Each of these visualisation libraries has its own salient 
features. Depending on the context, specific libraries may 
be adopted for implementation. Moreover, some of these 
libraries are dependent on other libraries. For example, 
Seaborn is a statistical data visualisation library that uses 
Matplotlib, a visualisation library widely used by Python 
developers. This article presents an overall view of five 
visualisation libraries of Python, which are: Bokeh, Seaborn, 
Altair, ggplot and Pygal.
Bokeh
The Bokeh (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) visualisation 
library is aimed at building interactive graphical 
representations. These are rendered in Web browsers. The 
visualisation rendered using Bokeh is in line with D3.js in 
terms of style. High performance and interactivity, even with 
large datasets, are important features of this library.

Resources 
Detailed descriptions about these concepts are provided in 
the official documentation (http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/
docs/reference.html#refguide). 
Bokeh facilitates linking various factors of different 
plots, which is referred to as linked panning. Here, some 
components are shared across multiple plots. Changing the 
range of one plot will update other plots as well. The sample 
code is given below and its output is shown in Figure 3.
import numpy as np
from bokeh.layouts import gridplot
from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show
# prepare some data
N = 100
x = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, N)
y0 = np.sin(x)
y1 = np.cos(x)
y2 = np.sin(x) + np.cos(x)
# output to static HTML file
output_file(“linked_panning.html”)
# create a new plot
s1 = figure(width=250, plot_height=250, title=None)
s1.circle(x, y0, size=10, color=”blue”, alpha=0.5)
# NEW: create a new plot and share both ranges
s2 = figure(width=250, height=250, x_range=s1.x_range, y_
range=s1.y_range, title=None)
s2.triangle(x, y1, size=10, color=”firebrick”, alpha=0.5)
# NEW: create a new plot and share only one range
s3 = figure(width=250, height=250, x_range=s1.x_range, 
title=None)
s3.square(x, y2, size=10, color=”green”, alpha=0.5)
# NEW: put the subplots in a gridplot
p = gridplot([[s1, s2, s3]], toolbar_location=None)
# show the results
show(p)
axis_label=’y’)
#4.  add a line renderer with legend and line thickness
p.line(x, y, legend=”Age”, line_width=3)
#5. show the results
show(p)
The output of the above code is shown in Figure 2. 
The major steps involved in building a plot with Bokeh 
are listed below:
 
Load the data required for plotting in variables. 
 
Specify the name of the output HTML file. The 
visualisation built with Bokeh will be saved as an HTML 
file and the output loaded in the browser. 
 
Use the figure() function to build a plot with options. 
 
Specific graphs can be constructed using a renderer. In the 
earlier-mentioned example, the renderer used is Figure.line.
The final step is to call the show() or save() function. 
The concepts involved in building visualisations 
using Bokeh are:

Glyphs

Guides and annotations

Altair
Altair is based on the declarative statistical visualisation 
approach available for Python. It is based on the high-
level Vega-Lite visualisation grammar that provides JSON 
syntax for the production of visualisations (https://vega.

Altair installation with Conda can be carried out with the 
following command: 
conda install altair --channel conda-forge
Altair has a very simple-to-use API. As the official 
documentation highlights, Altair enables the developer to 
build elegant visualisation with very minimal code. 
from altair import Chart, load_dataset
# load data as a pandas DataFrame
cars = load_dataset(‘cars’)
Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x=’Horsepower’,
    y=’Miles_per_Gallon’,
    color=’Origin’,
The output of the above code is shown in Figure 4. The 
data source is DataFrame. 
The major benefit of using Altair is that the developer has 
to specify only what is required and does not have to specify 
how to produce it. Altair has features to render various types of 
charts. For example, a code-snippet to produce a Streamgraph 
is shown below and its output is shown in Figure 5. 
Chart(data).mark_area(stacked=’center’).encode(
    X(‘date:T’, timeUnit=’yearmonth’,
      axis=Axis(format=’%Y’, labelAngle=0, title=’year’)),
    Y(‘sum(count)’),
    color=Color(‘series:N’, scale=Scale(range=”category20b”))
)
A tutorial on Altair is available at https://github.com/
altair-viz/altair/blob/273a1fcf9cec1956474af755d5fe32f0e3f0
aee8/altair/notebooks/02-Introduction.ipynb. 
Seaborn
The Seaborn library is aimed at building informative 
statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of Matplotlib. 
Seaborn also has tight integration with the PyData stack. The 
major features of the Seaborn library are:
 
The availability of various built-in themes, which help in 
improving the aesthetics of the visualisation. 
 
The support for various statistical features such as linear 
regression models and functions to plot statistical time series. 
Seaborn can be installed easily with the following 
command: 
pip install seaborn
It provides options to build a variety of graphs. The 
Hexbin plot-building source code is  shown below:
x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 
1000).T
with sns.axes_style(“white”):
    sns.jointplot(x=x, y=y, kind=”hex”, 
color=”k”);
The output of the above code is shown in Figure 6. 
A Violin plot made with Seaborn is shown in Figure 7. 
The source code is shown below: 
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.set(style=”whitegrid”)
# Load the example dataset of brain network correlations
df = sns.load_dataset(“brain_networks”, header=[0, 1, 2],

ggplot
ggplot is a visualisation library that is based on ggplot2 of R. 
The plotting approach used in ggplot is based on Grammar of 
Graphics.  ggplot is simple to learn. It can be installed using 
the Pip command as shown below:

has lots of features, which may be explored from the official 
documentation of the respective libraries. The choice of a 
particular library entirely depends on the nature of the task, 
the hardware and software ecosystem in which the task needs 
to be completed, and also the developers’ expertise.

This is not about hygiene and sanitation. In Java, garbage refers to unreferenced 
objects. Java memory can be made more efficient by removing these objects. Garbage 
collection is the process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory, automatically. 
A Sneak Peek into the  
World of Garbage Collection 
Survivor1 and Survivor2. When created, objects reside 
in Eden; if garbage collection (GC) does not result in 
sufficient memory space inside Eden, then the object is 
allocated to the Old generation. When garbage is being 
collected from Eden, the GC runs from the root to all 
reachable objects and marks them as alive—this process 
is called marking. After marking, all the live objects are 
copied from Eden to Survivor spaces, after which the 
whole of Eden is empty and can be reused to allocate more 
objects. This entire process is named as Mark and Copy. 
Beside Eden lie the Survivor spaces called 1 and 2, one of 
which is always empty. It is this empty space that will start 
getting filled once the GC works on Eden.
The copying of live objects in Survivor space is 
repeated several times, until some objects are considered 
mature enough and are promoted to the Old generation, 
where they reside until they become unreachable. In 
contrast to the Young generation, the size of the Old 
generation is quite large, and the frequency of GC here 
is less than in the Young generation. When GC takes 
place in the Old generation, the following takes place: 
a) Reachable objects are marked by setting the marked 
bit next to all objects accessible through GC roots; b) All 
unreachable objects are deleted; and c) The content of old 
space is compacted by copying live objects contiguously 
T
here was a time when developers were under constant 
pressure to write efficient code that kept a check on 
the memory usage and cleaning up of unused or idle 
resources. This constraint not only added to the woes of the 
developer but also made the code lengthy and repetitive. 
Java, the object orient language, came up with a brilliant 
mechanism for garbage collection. It eased the load on 
coders by running a daemon thread that automatically 
cleaned the memory as and when required and made it 
available for the program.
Now, the question is: where does Java keep the object? 
Well, the answer is that since Java abides by the OOPs 
paradigm, it stores everything as an object in the Heap 
memory. Whenever objects are created, they occupy some 
space in the Heap and are further referenced as per usage. 
From time to time, JVM marks objects that are idle for a 
long time or are not referenced, and selects them for deletion. 
Garbage collection in Java is tracking down all the objects 
that are still used, and marking the rest as garbage.
Before getting into garbage collection, let’s understand 
the memory pool of Java, i.e., how the Heap is divided into 
different segments and where objects are present within the 
Heap at different times. To start with, the Heap is divided into 
the Young and Tenured generations, along with the PermGen 
space. The Young generation is further divided into Eden,

Compact or mark-sweep-compact solves the shortcomings 
of ‘mark and sweep’ by moving all marked – and thus alive – 
objects to the beginning of the memory region. 
Copy or ‘mark and copy’ algorithms are very similar to 
the ‘mark and compact’ as they too relocate all live objects. 
The important difference is that the target of relocation is a 
different memory region as a new home for survivors.
to the beginning of the Old space. Next comes the Permanent 
Generation, a.k.a. PermGen, which existed prior to Java 
8 and was used to store the metadata information of the 
objects. With Java 8, the class definitions are now loaded 
into metaspace, which is located in the native memory and 
does not interfere with the regular Heap objects. By default, 
the metaspace size is only limited by the amount of native 
memory available to the Java process.
Moving on, GC is mainly categorised into three types, 
namely, Minor GC, Major GC and Full GC. Minor GC works 
on the Young generation and is triggered when the JVM 
is unable to allocate the space for a new object. Besides, it 
does trigger the stop-the-world pause suspending all the live 
threads. Major GC runs on the Old Generation while the full 
GC works on cleaning the entire Heap.
Java implements different algorithms to achieve GC and, 
to understand them, let’s start with some basic terminology. 
 
Marking reachable objects: GC defines some specific 
objects as GC roots. Examples are local variables and 
input parameters of currently executing methods, active 
threads, static field of the loaded classes, JNI references, 
etc. This phase calls the stop-the-world pause.   
 
Removing unused objects: Removal of unused objects 
is somewhat different for different GC algorithms, but 
all such algorithms can be divided into three groups—
sweeping, compacting and copying.
Sweeping or ‘mark and sweep’ means that after the 
marking phase is complete, all space occupied by unvisited 
objects is considered free and can thus be reused to 
allocate new objects.
Figure 1: The memory structure of Heap
Figure 3: Memory status after sweep
Figure 4: Memory status after compacting
Figure 5: Memory status after copying
Figure 6: Different algorithms for garbage collection
Figure 2: Marking live objects in the Heap
We are done with all the basics and the terminology. Let’s 
now explore the different algorithms of GC. Basically, these can 
be put in four categories—namely, Serial, Parallel, CMS and G1. 
Serial GC: In this, the GC uses mark-copy for the Young 
Generation and mark-sweep-compact for the Old Generation. 
Both the collectors are single threaded and trigger stop-
the-world pauses, stopping all application threads. This GC 
algorithm cannot thus take advantage of multiple CPU cores 
commonly found in modern hardware.
Parallel GC: This uses mark-copy in the Young 
Generation and mark-sweep-compact in the Old Generation. 
Both Young and Old collections trigger stop-the-world events, 
stopping all application threads from performing garbage 
collection. It uses multiple threads and, thus, is suitable on 
multi-core machines in cases where your primary goal is 
to increase throughput. High throughput is achieved due to 
effective usage of system resources in two ways.

Asciidoctor is an open source implementation of Asciidoc in Ruby. It is a fast, 
open source text processor and publishing tool. It is packed as a Ruby gem and 
is included in several Linux distros.
Asciidoctor: A Fun Way of 
Learning Asciidoc
$sudo gem install asciidoctor
Text formatting
Type the following content in the text editor and save the 
file as favs.asc:
= My Favourite Books
The Scarlet Pimpernel
The Count of Monte Cristo
The Christmas Carol
The Tale of Two Cities
Now open your terminal and issue the command:     
$asciidoctor favs.asc
Then return to the current working directory, 
where you will find an HTML file with the same 
name as your Asciidoctor file, which you need to open 
in your browser.
You will find all the book names in one single line, one 
after the other, but the output would be a little bit more 
readable if each name was in a single line. To do this, add 
the ‘+’ at the end of each book name as follows:
The Scarlet Pimpernel +
The Count of Monte Cristo +
The Christmas Carol +
W
riting is not an easy task but has evolved into an 
essential one. In the tech industry, documentation 
is very important for any software, as it contains 
information such as system requirements, the introduction of 
the software, its features, limitations, provisions for extension 
in its operations, etc.
Writing emails is one thing, but writing technical 
documentation or any formal document is another matter 
altogether. Presentation plays a huge role while writing any 
document. When you are writing an email, you focus only on 
the content. People seldom worry about the format in their 
emails, but in a technical document, formatting your content 
has some significance. The font type and size, colour, spacing, 
indentation, line spacing, spaces between paragraphs, lists, 
etc, are all very important in a document. 
So when you are typing your content in a word 
processor, your flow of thoughts tends to get interrupted by 
the continuous formatting required in it.  Asciidoctor is a 
Ruby implementation of Asciidoc, which helps you to write 
tech documents as easily as writing a plain text document. 
Asciidoctor is based on the Ruby language. It comes with 
all the simplicity that any typical Ruby code possesses—it 
is easy to learn and you will be able to write content in 
Asciidoctor in no time.  
Installation
Asciidoctor is a Ruby gem; so its installation is like any 
other Ruby gem you’ve installed in your system. Issue the 
following command in your Linux terminal:

|===
The vertical bar with three equal signs (|===) is used to define 
the boundaries of a table. The default table data format in 
Asciidoctor is PSV (pipe separated values). Data is displayed 
in cells, and each cell is created in Asciidoctor as soon as a 
vertical bar (|) is encountered in the code.
Each row shares the same number of cells. If any vertical 
bar is detected without any data next to it, it will create an 
empty cell in your table.
cols attribute: When you are creating the cells of a row 
individually on a consecutive line, you will need to use the 
cols attribute to specify the number of columns for the table, 
as shown below:
[cols=”3*”]
|===
|Debian
|Fedora
|RedHat
|Open Suse
|Linux Mint
|Apricity
|===
Please note that if you prefer to avoid the cols attribute 
in your table, your table will be rendered in the number of 
columns with respect to the number of cells right after the 
character (|===).
Column alignment: You can align the column content 
as left, right or centre. In the following code, you can use a 
different alignment for each column in the table, or you can 
align all the columns in the same way.
[cols=”3*”]
[cols=”<,^,>”]
|===
The Tale of Two Cities +
The above code will add line breaks after the ‘+’, so that 
each book name is displayed in a single line. Now, let us look 
at some of the basic text formatting options that are often used 
in your documents.
Text can be made bold by adding an ‘*’ (asterix) character 
at both ends of the word, as follows:
*The Scarlet Pimpernel*
Or you can italicise a word by using the ‘_’ (underscore) 
character wrapped around the word, as shown below:
_The Scarlet Pimpernel_
These rules can be applied to a single character also. If 
you want to apply a monospace font style to a particular piece 
of text, you can use the ‘`’ character, as follows: 
`The Scarlet Pimpernel`
Or you can use multiple styles for a single word or line, as 
shown below: 
The **Adventure** _of_ **_``D``ancing_** `**M**en`
To highlight text, enclose the text using ‘#’, as 
shown below: 
The Secret #Adversary#
 There are cases when you want specific words to be in a 
smaller font. To achieve this effect, add the [small] attribute 
followed by the '#' enclosing the word as shown below:
   Mary had a [small]#little# lamb
In the same way, you can add a word in a bigger font, as 
follows:
 That Polar bear is [big]##huge##
 The outputs for the above code snippets are displayed in 
Figure 1.
Tables
Tables in Asciidoctor have a simple syntax, but offer 
sophisticated features.
Let’s start with the simple example of how to define tables 
in Asciidoctor:

In the above code, ‘<’ means left alignment, ‘^’ means 
centre alignment, and ‘>’ means right alignment.
Column width: Setting the column width is useful— 
your content doesn’t overlap in the table because of lack of 
space. The width values range from 1-99.
[cols=”10,20,30”]
|===
|Debian
|Fedora
|RedHat
|Open Suse
|===
Cell duplication: Sometimes, in tables, the same data 
needs to be replicated in consecutive columns—for example, 
default values. To duplicate a cell for successive columns, you 
can use the number along with the ‘*’ as a prefix to ‘|’. 
|===
|London |Sydney |Hamburg
3*|Stockholm
|Nairobi |Prague |Budapest
|===
Importing from external sources: Asciidoctor can 
import CSV and DSV datasets to your tables using the include 
directive, as follows: 
[format=”csv”, options=”header”]
|===
include::movie.csv[]
|===
The first line of the code states the format of the dataset 
that will be used in this table and adds the header for the table.
Lists
Asciidoctor supports both ordered and unordered lists. The 
syntax for declaring them looks similar, except for one tiny 
character. For unordered lists, you need to use ‘*’, as shown 
below: 
* Alexander Dumas
* Baroness Orcy
* Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
* George Orwell
If you wish to have square bullets for your lists, modify 
the code as shown below:
[square]
* Alexander Dumas
* Baroness Orcy
* Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
* George Orwell
For ordered lists, you can use ‘.’ in front of the items you 
wish to place in a list, as follows:
.My Favorite Authors
. Frederick Forsyth
. Dan Brown
. Steve Berry
. Scott Mariani
It is important to notice that, in the first line, there’s no 
space between the period and the title of the list. Also, there’s 
a space given between the period and the list items. 
If you wish to reverse the list, just add [%reversed] at the 
top of the list declaration, as shown below:
[%reversed]

Images, video and audio
Image: An image is worth a thousand words. People 
find documents that contain only text  unattractive and 
boring. Inserting images in your document could spice up 
the overall content. 
.Duck Duck Go Search Engine Logo
image::duck-duck-go-logo.png[200,200]
The first line of the code adds a caption for the image, 
the second line inserts the image file duck-duck-go-logo.png, 
and the numbers in the brackets show the specified width and      
height of the image instead of its original size.
When you want to keep your images in a separate folder, 
you may use the :imagesdir: attribute. It will require an 
absolute path of that particular folder. You can save all the 
images in this folder to avoid them getting mixed up with 
other documents. 
:imagesdir: /home/admin/Downloads/
image::Mozilla_Foundation_logo.svg.png[200,200]
 The first line tells Asciidoctor where to look for the 
images. In our case, it is Downloads. The next line inserts 
the image Mozilla_Foundation_logo.svg.png from the 
Downloads folder.
If you want to use an image from the Web, just add the file 
URL for the particular image, followed by brackets; it has the 
alternative text, width and height of the image.
 
image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/
Elementary_logo.svg[ Elementary _OS,200,200]
Video and audio: Videos can be inserted in two ways. We 
can either use video from a video streaming site (YouTube or 
Vimeo) or you can add the video file from local storage:
.Creative Commons Video
video::sPuSg53RFb0[youtube]
The above line embeds a video from YouTube. The 
contents of the brackets show the name of the video streaming 
site. It is recommended that you use video files from the 
streaming sites since they provide an optimised version of 
the file, depending on the network, hardware and browser 
capabilities of your system.
Audio files can be included in the same way as video files, 
as shown below: 
audio::yousetmefree.mp3[]
Other useful features
Apart from what’s mentioned above, Asciidoctor also offers 
some awesome features that can be used for fine tuning your 
content.
Admonition blocks: Writers use admonition blocks in 
their documentation in order to highlight the information. 
The most common admonition types are important, 
tip, warning, caution and note. In Asciidoctor, we can 
use them as follows:
 :icons: font
      [TIP]
    This is a local site without Online connections on the 
Internet.
     [CAUTION]
     Cautionary Message
     [WARNING]
     Please read carefully, this is a Warning message
     [NOTE]
     This is the site for you!!!
     [IMPORTANT]
    This could be important
The first line of the code is optional, it instructs the 
asciidoctor to add icons instead of words to display the 
admonition blocks in your document.
Textual replacements:  We can use textual replacement 
symbols such as copyright, registered and trade mark in the 
content, as shown below: 
(C) - Copyright
(R) - Registered
(TM) – Trademark
Footnotes: Footnotes are special comments, references 
or additional information, which are usually placed at

During collection, all cores clean the garbage in parallel, 
resulting in shorter pauses; and between garbage collection 
cycles, neither of the collectors consumes any resources.
Concurrent mark and sweep CMS: This uses the 
parallel stop-the-world mark-copy algorithm in the Young 
Generation and, usually, the concurrent mark-sweep 
algorithm in the Old Generation. This collector avoids 
long pauses while collecting in the Old Generation, as it 
does not compact the Old Generation, but uses free lists to 
manage reclaimed space; and it does most of the job in the 
mark-and-sweep phases concurrently with the application. 
This algorithm is divided into seven phases. These are: i) 
Initial mark, ii) Concurrent mark, iii) Concurrent Pre-clean, 
iv) Concurrent abortable Pre-clean, v) Final Remark, vi) 
Concurrent Sweep, and vii) Concurrent Reset.
G1: This is also known as Garbage-First and, with it, 
you can set specific performance goals. You can request the 
stop-the-world pauses to be no longer than x milliseconds 
within any given y-millisecond long time-range, e.g., no more 
than 5 milliseconds in any given second. Garbage-First GC 
will do its best to meet this goal with high probability (but not 
with certainty, as that would be hard to do in real-time). G1 
has totally redesigned the way the objects are stored in Heap. 
It does not have the concept of Young and Old generations; 
instead, the Heap is split into a number of smaller (typically 
about 2048) Heap regions that can house objects. Each region 
may be an Eden region, a Survivor region or an Old region, as 
shown in Figure 7.
With all this information, you are up to date with the 
different types of garbage collection mechanisms. You can 
play around with the different GC algorithms by applying 
them in different generations of the Heap.

This article gives a 
detailed description 
of Solr. It is aimed at 
geeks who have built 
a Web application 
and want to make the 
search for it faster. 
Solr: The Platform that 
Makes Search Easy
The preferred environment for the purpose of this article 
is Solr-5.3.0. Before you begin the Solr installation, make sure 
you have JDK installed and Java_Home is set appropriately.
Solr makes search easy
To understand how Solr makes search easy, we first have to 
configure it. As I am using Windows 7, I will demonstrate 
Solr in Windows. Solr is open source, so it can easily be 
downloaded from the Solr website. But remember, to run 
Solr, you need to have JRE installed in your system. For a 
Windows system, download the .zip file. To get started, all 
you need to do is extract the Solr distribution archive to a 
directory of your choosing. Once extracted, you are ready to 
run Solr in your system. 
You can start Solr by running bin\Solr.cmd, if you 
are using Windows. This will start Solr on port 8983. If 
everything is fine, Solr will start by saying, ‘Happy Search!’. 
If you want to change the port number, then give the 
command Solr start -p port number, using cmd. You can also 
use the Solr -help command to know the various types of 
commands in Solr. When Solr starts running, it will generate a 
URL to see the admin console. Commonly, the URL is http://
S
olr (pronounced Solar) was created by Yonik Seeley 
in 2004. Apache Solr is an open source search 
platform based on the Apache Lucene search library. 
In a sense, Solr is a cover over the Apache Lucene library. 
It uses the Lucene class to create an inverted index. Apache 
Solr is built upon Java. Most search websites are today 
built upon Solr, of which the most popular are e-commerce 
sites. Solr runs on standalone full-text search servers. The 
Lucene Java search library is used to create an index, which 
is used by Solr to perform searches. Solr has an HTML/
XML interface and JSON APIs on which search applications 
are created. In layman’s terms, Solr can be defined as 
follows: “Apache Solr is a search engine—you index a set of 
documents and then query Solr to return a set of documents 
that matches the user query.”
Solr gained popularity because it is fast, and can index 
and search multiple sites. It returns relevant content based on 
the search query’s taxonomy. Other important features are: 
faceted searching, dynamic clustering, database integration, 
NoSQL features, rich document handling, a comprehensive 
administration interface, high scalability and fault tolerance, 
as well as real-time indexing.

Let's Try
Figure 1: Admin homepage of Solr
Figure 2: Schema.xml
Figure 3: Document import  
localhost:8983/Solr/
Now, to start the search in Solr, 
you first have to create the core file, 
by giving the command Solr create 
-c core_name, in cmd. The core file 
mainly contains configuration files in 
the conf folder.
Solr makes it easy to search for an 
application. You just have to define a 
schema according to your dataset in 
schema.xml, which is a file that defines 
the representation of the documents 
that are indexed/ingested in Solr, i.e., 
the set of data fields that they contain. 
For example, a newspaper article may 
contain a title, author name, body text, 
date, etc. You have to mention the data 
type of those fields in schema.xml. 
Figure 2 shows how to define data fields 
in schema.xml.   
After defining Schema, deploy Solr 
into your data either in the database 
or by uploading data files. Figure 3 
shows how to upload data in Solr in 
various formats in order to supply Solr 
documents for each user who searches.  
As Solr is based upon open 
standards, it is highly extensible. 
Solr fires queries that are RESTful in 
nature, which means that the query is 
as simple as an HTTP request URL and 
the response is an ordered document 
– mainly, XML, CSV, JSON or some 
other formats. 
Basic syntax, schema.xml, with 
an example
Fields: You can simply define a field 
name or dataset in schema.xml as 
follows:
field name =”string”  indexed=”true” 
stored=”true” multiValued=”true” 
required=”true”
Here, ‘name’ is the name of the 
field type. This value is used in field 
definitions, in the ‘type’ attribute. 
‘Indexed’ default value is true—the 
value of the field can be used to query 
and to retrieve matching documents. 
The ‘stored’ default value is true—the 
actual value of the field can be retrieved 
by queries. ‘multiValued’ default value

is false; if true, it indicates that a single 
document might contain multiple 
values. ‘required’ default value is 
false—it instructs Solr to reject any 
attempt  to add a document that does 
not have a value for this field. Figure 2 
shows how to define field type. 
Dynamic fields: Solr has strong 
data typing for fields, yet it provides 
flexibility using ‘Dynamic fields’. 
Using the <dynamic field> tag 
declaration, you can create field rules 
that Solr will use to understand what 
data type should be used whenever it is 
given a field name that is not explicitly 
defined, but matches a prefix or suffix  
used in the dynamic field.
For example, dynamic field 
affirmation tells Solr that whenever it 
sees a name ending in ‘_i’ which is not 
an explicitly defined field, then it should 
dynamically create an integer field like 
what’s shown below: 
<dynamicField name =”*_i” 
type=”integer” indexed=”true” 
stored=”true”/>
Copy fields: The <copyField> 
declaration is used to instruct Solr 
that you want to duplicate any data it 
sees in the ‘source’ field of documents 
that are added to the index, in the 
‘destination’ field of that document. 
But remember that datatypes of the 
fields are compatible. Duplication of 
fields is done before any analysers are 
invoked. By the use of copy field, Solr 
will be able to search by simply giving 
the value and not defining the tag. For 
example, if there is a field like Roll 
number, without the use of copyField,  
we can search by giving the command 
‘rollno:10’.
 With the use of copyField, the 
syntax of the copy field declaration is:
<copyField source=”rollno” 
dest=”text”/> 
Now we can search just by 
typing ‘10’ and Solr will give you the 
same result.

You can query by clicking on the 
query tab which looks like what’s 
shown in Figure 6. 
Solr vs Elastic Search (ES)
Solr and Elastic Search are competing 
search servers. Both are built on top 
of Lucene, so their core features are 
identical. In fact, Solr and ES are so 
similar that an ES plug-in allows you to 
use Solr client/tools with ES. For most 
functions, there is no genuine cause to 
choose Solr over ES, or vice versa. But 
there are some minor differences listed 
in the table shown in Figure 7.
Deploying Solr with Tomcat
Please note, this deployment is done 
in Solr 5.1. The prerequisites are 
listed below.
1.  Install the Tomcat Servlet Container 
on the system as follows:
 C:\Solr with Tomcat\apache-
tomcat-7.0.57 
(We will refer to it as TOMCAT_
HOME.)
2.  Download and extract the Solr 
package as follows:
C:\Solr-5.1.0\Solr-5.1.0
Now follow the steps given below.
1)  Copy the Solr directory from the 
extracted package (C:\Solr-5.1.0\
Solr-5.1.0\server\Solr) into the 
home directory of Tomcat—into 
TOMCAT_HOME\bin or into 
TOMCAT_HOME if Tomcat is to be 
Figure 7: Differences between Solr and ES
started as a service.
2) Copy the Solr war file (C:\Solr-5.1.0\
Solr-5.1.0\server\webapps\Solr.war) 
into the Tomcat Web apps directory, 
TOMCAT_HOME/webapps. Tomcat 
will automatically deploy it.
3) Copy all the five jar files from the 
Solr extracted package (C:\Solr-
5.1.0\Solr-5.1.0\server\lib\ext) to 
the TOMCAT_HOME\lib directory.
• jul-to-slf4j-1.7.7,
• jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.7,
• slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7,
• slf4j-api-1.7.7,
• log4j-1.2.17
4)  Copy the log4j.properties file 
from the C:\Solr-5.1.0\Solr-5.1.0\
server\resources directory to the 
TOMCAT_HOME\lib directory.
5) After Solr.war is extracted: 
a) Create the core (if not already 
done).
b) Copy the further needed 
listener-specific jars to C:\
Solr with the Tomcat\apache-
tomcat-7.0.57\webapps\Solr\
WEB-INF\lib directory.
c) Configure the entry for listener-
related jars to the scheduler 
in the C:\Solr With Tomcat\
apache-tomcat-7.0.57\webapps\
Solr\WEB-INF\web.xml file.
d) Modify the server port in 
the properties file of the 
scheduler (for example, C:\
Solr with Tomcat\apache-
tomcat-7.0.57\bin\Solr\conf\
dataimportScheduler.properties).
e) In order to run the data-
importhandler, copy the jars 
specific to the data-importhandler 
and for the custom transformer, 
if any, in the folder C:\Solr With 
Tomcat\apache-tomcat-7.0.57\
bin\Solr\lib.
• Solr-dataimporthandler-5.1.0.jar
• Solr-dataimporthandler-extras-
5.1.0.jar
• ojdbc14-10.2.0.5.jar
• SqltoSolrDateTransformer.jar
and change the entry in  Solrconfig.xml 
for the same as 
      <!-- for data import handler --> 
 <lib dir=”../lib/” regex=”Solr-
dataimporthandler-\d.*\.jar” /> 
<lib dir=”../lib/” regex=”ojdbc14-
\d.*\.jar” /> 
<!-- For Custom Date Tranformer  -->
 
 <lib dir=”../lib/” 
regex=”SqltoSolrDateTransformer.jar” /> 
Start the Tomcat server from 
TOMCAT_HOME\bin\startup.bat 
and locate the Web browser to http://
localhost:8080/Solr (change the port if 
necessary).The admin page of Solr will 
be displayed.
What next?
Congratulations! You have understood 
the basics of Solr. You have learned 
about its syntax and different fields, 
how it makes search easy, the 
differences between Elastic Search and 
Solr, and how to deploy Tomcat with 
Solr. The next step is discovering how 
to connect Java (or any other language) 
with Solr, or, how to integrate Solr with 
your application.

Q How has TechBlue grown as an open source enabler?
We were initially using open source solutions at our own end. 
But once we got some positive results, we started offering 
those solutions to our customers. We offered people the same 
solutions that we had developed for ourselves. This helped us 
grow in the open source market and build a strong presence 
even in some emerging markets like India.
There is one big difference in India compared to western 
markets, and that’s the awareness about the importance of 
licensing. Indian consumers do not use licensed software, 
in a way people in the US and UK do, for their operations. 
Therefore, we make certain changes in our offerings to suit 
the local audience.
Q Where does India stand in the list of open source enablers?
India is the number one market for us right now. Obviously, 
we are providing support across worldwide markets, but 
if we are asked to pick a key region, India comes first 
and is our biggest market.
“India will be 
the biggest 
powerhouse for 
open source in 
the world”
Open source has become 
fairly big in India. UK-
based Vik Tara is the 
founder of TechBlue, 
which delivers a number 
of open source solutions 
for Indian customers, like 
Hamara Linux for Indian 
techies. Jagmeet Singh 
of OSFY speaks with 
Tara to understand his 
views on the Indian open 
source space. Edited 
excerpts…
Several companies from across the world consider India as 
the key market to achieve success in the world of open source. 
The reason behind this growth is the preferences of Indian 
consumers, who are more inclined to open source rather than 
any proprietary solutions.
Q Do you think India is yet to become a producer 
of open source?
No, that is not the current scenario. India is presently not only a 
producer but also a major enabler of open source. The maturity 
of many projects, even some big ones, includes contributions 
from a significant number of Indian developers. Whether you 
About TechBlue

software as well as building mobile and Web apps.

look at OpenStack or Linux, all these projects have been 
enhanced by several developers located in India.
The potential of Indian developers is indeed not as high 
as the professional programmers in western countries, but 
this does not mean that India is merely a user of open source. 
There are enormous projects that are being maintained on 
Indian soil. Also, the size of the Indian market is bigger than 
most developed regions.
At TechBlue, we have Hamara Linux that is our leading 
open source project. We spent enormous effort, money and 
time to launch this Indian Linux distribution. The platform 
has so far been totally developed and maintained by the 
community in India.
When you go to our GitHub account, you will find 
projects like JBox Controller, which  include plenty of 
contributions from Indian developers.
So this is how India is already enabling open source 
growth, and could soon become the leader in terms of the 
number of developers and contributions.
Q What are your plans to increase community 
efforts from India?
We are already sponsoring events and conferences to 
stimulate community interest in our offerings. Additionally, 
we are organising meetups around Hamara Linux in 
universities and institutes to engage with more IT students 
and open source enthusiasts in the Indian market. It is a good 
way to efficiently shop for skilled talent.
Contribution helps a lot in a company like TechBlue, 
because when you are contributing to a project, a learned 
person will participate to help you fulfil your goals. In 
addition to involving others in your project, community 
efforts are the key to helping open source companies learn 
innovative ways to succeed.
In addition to the community engagements through tech 
conventions, we are also looking around for locations to set up 
some hacker spaces. We would like to have a Hamara Hacker 
Space in different locations across India. This would give 
enthusiasts a space to experience and test the Linux platform.
Q How is Hamara Linux different from other Linux 
distributions?
We looked at small things while developing Hamara Linux. 
First, we considered the styling. The distribution should look 
decent and be culturally acceptable to Indian users. Second, 
we looked at language, translation and even the naming of 
the applications. If you are targeting non-native English 
speakers, then you have to choose names that are in their 
native languages.
Our Hamara Linux is not a universal operating 
system. Instead, it has been created specifically for one 
part of society. This is the reason we need to customise 
the experience only for our niche. This helps us establish 
more engagements around our product.
Having said that, Hamara Linux is still a Linux 
distribution at its core, and is based on the same kernel that 
you might have seen on many other platforms.
Q Apart from the operating system and other solutions in the 
open source space, you also offer consultancy. Why is there a 
need for an open source company to provide consultancy?
We offer consultancy because people do not know how 
to implement an open source solution but are keen to 
find a relevant option for their operations. It also helps in 
maintaining an existing deployment.
Through consultancy, we free businesses from being locked 
in. We also provide the proper information about what customers 
need to choose today to gain fruitful results in the future.
Q Despite many consultants operating in the market today, 
do you think there is still lack of training and awareness in 
the open source world?
Yes, there is lack of knowledge and skills compared to the 
demand. The demand keeps on growing, but training and 
awareness of open source remains at a low level.
If you look at companies like Red Hat and SUSE, they 
have created massive businesses from open source. But the 
mentality and usage patterns of the common people are yet 
to evolve. Very few people know how to contribute for free, 
and similarly, how to receive help or contributions from the 
available communities.
However, things are getting better now. Students and 
enthusiasts are now focusing entirely on open source. 
IT professionals are also taking the open source way 
to garner profits.
Q How do you manage recruitments for various open source 
developments?
We actually try to recruit as many people as possible to enrich 
our projects with their knowledge. Rather than considering 
academics, we prefer skills.
Q What are your views on open source as a career option?
Open source is huge as a career option. People with experience in 
open source are likely to find better jobs than other professionals. 
If you do not know Linux now and you are a developer, you are 
harming your career prospects. Most people are getting jobs 
just because of their skills in working with code.
From a career perspective, job seekers need to specify 
Contribution helps a lot

their contributions to open source in their CVs.
If you come to us, we offer jobs very quickly to those 
who are already active on GitHub and are contributing 
on some of the active projects. We look out for such 
enthusiastic people.
Q Do you see open source as the future of computing?
It is inevitable that this should happen. I see that the future 
of computing is certainly  open source. There are so many 
developers, and all of them are employed by different 
companies which have several products in the market, but 
the same developers are also contributing to their own 
projects in their free time. So, eventually, because of the 
total number of developers contributing towards an open 
source solution, you actually have more production capacity 
in the open source world than you do in the proprietary 
world. So, on both accounts—coding and making a product 
—the open source solution will win out because it has more 
developers contributing over a longer period of time.
You can see this happen in most of the successful open 
source products. Linux is one of the major successes from the 
open source bouquet. It was started much after proprietary 
operating systems, but it caught up in a short span of time and 
then overtook the latter. Right now, we can say that the Linux 
operating system is far better than any proprietary counterpart, 
whether it is Windows or Mac OS. It is substantially more 
secure and better than any popular commercial solution. Also, 
the platform maintains a wide community, and has a vast 
number of developers and contributors.
Apart from Linux, there is Apache Web Server that beats 
the proprietary option. Mozilla’s Firefox is also a major 
example of open source success. Likewise, Android countered 
leaders such as BlackBerry OS and iOS with its powerful, 
community-focused features.
Thus, it is given that the future of computing and 
the IT world is all led by open source. Any proprietary 
solution available in today’s market needs to have a much 
higher efficiency and effectiveness to overtake the growth 
of open source. 
Q What is your prediction for the Indian open source space?
India will be the biggest powerhouse for open source in 
the world. One major factor is that we currently have many 
developers. In the West, open source has already succeeded. 
In India, it is in an interesting and exciting space, and 
people have realised that they have learnt a lot from it and 
that it has benefited their career. This has persuaded many 
Indian developers to enter this domain, and they are getting 
more and more involved with open source. So, India will 
dominate this field very soon.

For U & Me
Let’s Try
There are many reasons why Linux is preferred over proprietary 
software. This article lists the top ten.
Ten Reasons  
Why We Should Use Linux
around once a year or so to keep it in good condition. Once 
installed, the Linux OS need not be reinstalled for years. 
The Linux OS runs exactly as fast as it did when first 
installed, even after several years. Most of us must have 
experienced how a freshly installed Windows system runs 
extremely fast and the same system becomes slow after 
around six months to one year. The same system becomes 
very slow and, gradually, begins to run like a snail within 
six months to one year. Then, your only option most of the 
time is to reinstall the OS and all the other software.
 
The uptime for the Linux servers is very high 
and the availability is around 99.9 per cent. Unlike 
Windows, you need not reboot a Linux server after 
every update or patch. Due to this, Linux has the 
highest number of servers running on the Internet. 
According to an article on the zdnet website, 96.3 
per cent of the top 1 million Web servers are 
running on Linux. Twenty-three out of the Top 
twenty five websites run on Linux. The two 
remaining websites in the top twenty five 
are live.com and bing.com, which belong to 
Microsoft! 
 
3. Ease of maintenance: 
Maintaining the Linux OS is easy, as the 
user can centrally update the OS and all 
software installed very easily. All the variants 
of Linux have their own central software repository, 
which is used to update the system and keep it safe. They 
offer regular updates and the system can be updated 
without rebooting it. The updating can be done periodically, 
with just a few clicks, or users can even automate the 
updating process. Updating a Windows system is not so 
easy compared to a Linxu system. Also, in Windows, all the 
third party software like Acrobat Reader, Firefox, etc, have 
to be updated individually.
4. Runs on any hardware: All of us know that with every 
new release of Windows OS, a huge number of hardware 
systems become obsolete as their technical specifications 
are no longer adequate to run the latest Windows OS. 
Linux makes very efficient use of the system’s resources. 
Linux installation can be customised for users and 
for specific hardware requirements. The installation 
procedure is very flexible, and allows users to choose the 
modules they want to install. This allows them to install 
Linux even on old hardware, thus helping in optimal use 
of all the hardware resources. 
U
ntil a few years ago, Linux was used mainly 
for servers and was not considered suitable for 
desktops. But its user interface and ease of use has 
been steadily improving over the last few years. Linux has 
today become user-friendly enough to replace Windows 
on desktops. It is being used by hundreds of thousands of 
people across the globe. Here are the ten most important 
reasons why Linux ought to be adopted by home users, 
educational institutes and businesses.
1.  High security: Installing and using 
Linux on your system is the easiest 
way to avoid viruses and malware. The 
security aspect was kept in mind when developing Linux 
and it is much less vulnerable to viruses compared to 
Windows. Programs cannot make changes to the system 
settings and configuration unless the user is logged in as the 
root (equivalent to the administrator user in Windows) user. 
Most users do not log in as the root; hence, they cannot do 
much damage to the system, except to their own files and 
programs, since the downloaded file/malware will have 
limited privileges. You can browse the Internet without 
worrying about your system getting infected. However, 
users can install ClamAV antivirus software in Linux to 
further secure their systems.
The reason for this higher level of security is that since 
Linux is open source software, the source code is available 
for review. A huge number of developers all over the world 
have gone through the code, which means that most of the 
flaws have already been discovered.
2.  High stability: The Linux system is very stable and is not 
prone to crashes. The latter usually has to be reinstalled 

72 | FEBRUARY 2017 | OPEN SOURCE FOR YOU | www.OpenSourceForU.com
For U & Me
Let’s Try
to six options are available for any particular software. 
The Linux versions of most  popular browsers are 
available.The Linux philosophy is based on using 
several small programs, each of which does one task 
very well. But these programs can be combined to write 
really powerful programs and utilities. The Linux OS 
offers a command line interface with several shells 
to choose from. Systems administrators can enjoy the 
powerful command line interface and write shell scripts 
to automate routine maintenance and various other 
tasks.
9. Education: This is the most useful aspect for students, 
as they can use the software to study how it works, 
before modifying and extending the code to suit their 
needs. This will also help them to learn the internals of 
an OS and the software. This process will help in the 
development of new software and aid innovation based 
on local needs. Even if users are not programmers, they 
can contribute to Linux by helping in documentation, 
translation and testing.
Linux can be a fantastic educational tool for schools 
and colleges as free software is available to aid in teaching. 
Proprietary software for computation, like MATLAB, is very 
expensive. There are alternatives available to it like Scilab and 
GNU Octave. Linux software is available in many areas— 
Celestia and Stellarium for astronomy, Avogadro and Gabedit 
for chemistry, EMBOSS and TreeView X for biology; and 
ROOT, Octopus and Step for physics.  You can access the link 
https://linuxmint.tumblr.com/post/27284846595/92-of-the-
best-free-scientific-software-for-linux to get a comprehensive 
list of scientific software for Linux.
10. Support: There is strong community support for Linux 
over the Internet through various forums. Any question 
posed in forums will usually get a quick response as a 
lot of volunteers are online and working to solve the 
problems due to their passion for Linux. The paid support 
option is also available for commercial enterprises, with 
companies like Red Hat and Novell offering 24x7 support 
for critical applications and services. 
Linux runs on a range of hardware, right from 
supercomputers to watches. You can give new life to your old 
and slow Windows system by installing a lightweight Linux 
system, or even run a NAS or media streamer using a particular 
distribution of Linux. There are also lightweight desktops like 
Xfce and LXDE which can run on lower-end PCs.
5. Free: Linux is completely free and users do not need 
to pay for anything. All the basic software required by 
a typical user and even an advanced user are available. 
Dozens of educational software are available under Linux. 
Even the equivalent of professional software for desktop 
publishing, photo editing, audio editing and video editing 
are available. Businesses can use the software free of cost 
and reduce their IT budgets substantially.
6. Open source: The most important aspect of Linux is that 
its source code is available as it falls under the FOSS 
category (Free and Open Source Software). The developer 
community benefits from this as its members have the 
freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not 
the case with proprietary software, which they can only 
use. Several countries are developing their own versions 
of Linux. This will ultimately help these countries in 
developing their own OSs for specialised or strategic areas 
like defence, communications, etc, to begin with. Cyber 
warfare will play an important role in any war in the future. 
Usage of foreign and compromised computer operating 
systems and communication software can bring the 
country to its knees within a few days, both militarily and 
economically. Hence, using FOSS tools is critical for the 
security of any country. Several countries including China, 
Russia and Cuba are developing their own OSs based on 
Linux. C-DAC has developed BOSS (Bharat Operating 
System Solutions), India’s own PC operating system.
7. Ease of use: Contrary to the general belief that Linux is 
only for geeks, it has now become user-friendly and has a 
good graphical user interface (GUI). It has almost all the 
functionality that Windows has. The GUI has developed 
to the extent that most of what typical users want can be 
done on Linux, as easily as it is done in Windows, without 
knowing any commands.
In case you are using some applications which run only on 
Windows, you can install Wine (Windows Emulator), using 
which you can run those applications on a Linux system.
Though the perception is that Linux is not gamer 
friendly, several games are now available on Linux. Even if 
a particular game is not available on Linux, you can install 
PlayOnLinux to run Windows games.
8. Customisation: Users have tremendous flexibility in 
customising the system as per their requirements. There 
are numerous choices for wallpapers, desktop icons 
and panels. There are more than half-a-dozen desktop 
environments to choose from, like GNOME, KDE, 
etc. For any task, right from the GUI interface and file 
managers, to DVD burners and browsers, around four

Open Source Alternatives  
for Commonly Used 
Proprietary Software
fixing, feature enhancement, etc. Many open source software 
publishers don't charge people for using the software.
Let’s explore the different types of proprietary software 
and their open source alternatives.
Productivity software
The most commonly and frequently used proprietary 
software is Microsoft Office Suite, which consists of 
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Visio, OneNote, 
Publisher and Project. From the complete list of software 
in the suite, three draw special attention—Word, Excel 
and PowerPoint, as these are used by students, beginners 
and professionals. Most desktop users are familiar with 
Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint for tasks like letter 
drafting, report writing, and making some calculations, 
charts or presentations. Microsoft Office is proprietary 
software. One needs to purchase it before being able to use 
it. It comes in many variants and each has a different price, 
starting from ` 4000 and going up to ` 30,000 or more. It 
is available for Windows and Mac platforms.
N
owadays, a huge range of software is available for the 
desktop; some come pre-installed with the operating 
system and the rest can be downloaded from the 
Internet. Usage of the desktop differs from user to user, and 
so does the software requirement. This article explores the 
best open source alternatives for commonly used proprietary 
software on the desktop.
Before going ahead, we should understand the terms 
‘proprietary software’ and ‘open source software’. 
In simple words, proprietary software is owned by the 
company or publisher, and its source code is kept secret. 
People have to purchase this software to be able to use it. This 
could be a one-time payment or a recurring cost in case of 
subscription based models. A person can use the software but 
cannot view the source code or modify it. 
Open source software, as the name suggests, has its source 
code made available to the user of the software. The user can 
modify the source code and redistribute it, giving due credits.  
Usually, all open source software allows the community 
to participate in development activities, bug-spotting and

Proprietary software is usually costly and its source code is known only to the 
company that produces and markets it. Open source software is usually free, and 
its source code is available to the user who is free to modify it. Here’s a list of open 
source software that can be used in place of commonly used proprietary tools.

used by architects, engineers and professionals to create 2D 
and 3D models. FreeCAD and Archimedes are open source 
alternatives to the costly AutoCAD.
Diagrams
Microsoft Visio and Smart Draw are the other common 
proprietary software used by students and professionals for 
drawing various diagrams like UML, ER, flowcharts, etc. Dia 
is the open source alternative for Visio and SmartDraw. 
Video editing and rendering
Nowadays, creating video clips is very common due to the 
availability of camera phones. The concept of video blogging 
is also gaining momentum.  
The creation of videos for YouTube and other platforms 
is on the rise. Once the video is ready, it requires software 
to edit and render it properly. Adobe Premiere CC or Pro are 
used for this, but they are costly and proprietary. OpenShot 
and Handbrake are the best open source alternatives being 
used by many professionals. 
Audio recording and editing
Those in the music industry use many kinds of proprietary 
software to record and edit music, like Apple Logic Pro or FL 
Studio Producer Edition, which are both expensive. Audacity 
is open source software which allows you to record audio 
using a simple microphone, after which you can do all the 
professional tinkering you want to with the track. 
The best available alternative to Microsoft Office is 
LibreOffice and OpenOffice. Both are open source projects, 
community driven, cross platform, easy to use and intuitive. 
They are also compatible with Microsoft Office in terms of 
file formats. 
Apart from LibreOffice and OpenOffice, AbiWord is also 
available as an alternative to Microsoft Word.
Music and video playback
Listening to music and watching videos is a common 
passtime. There is a lot of proprietary software available 
for music and video playback like Windows Media Player, 
iTunes, RealPlayer, Winamp, to name a few. None of these 
players are versatile enough to playback all the formats, nor 
are they cross platform. 
The best alternative is to use VLC Media Player for video 
and audio playback. VLC is open source and cross platform. 
It not only does playback in any format, but also supports 
recording and streaming. 
Organiser and mail management
Microsoft Outlook is a commonly used email application. 
It works best with Microsoft Exchange Server or Microsoft 
SharePoint Server. Apart from email, it supports calendar, 
tasks, contacts and browsing. Mozilla Thunderbird is the open 
source alternative that can replace the email application, and 
it also provides the features of the calendar and address book. 
It can be used on any platform and comes with many features, 
plugins and add-ons.
Designing and publishing
Adobe Photoshop is common software for anyone working 
with images, which includes editing and manipulating 
these. It is used by graphics artists, designers and 
photographers. It works well with raster images. The cost 
of Adobe Photoshop is approximately ` 26,000, and it runs 
on Windows and Mac.
The GIMP, which is cross platform and open source 
software, is the best open source alternative to Adobe 
Photoshop. Its learning curve is a bit steep but you can do 
impressive things with it in the long run.
Adobe InDesign and Microsoft Publisher are standard tools 
for creating layouts and publishing magazines, newspapers, 
flyers, pamphlets, banners, etc. Both are costly and proprietary 
software. Scribus is the best open source alternative tool to them. 
It supports all the required features for publishing.
Vector based art is used to create art work which can 
scale up or be resized without losing the clarity, for which 
Adobe Illustrator is used. It is clean, simple and used in 
creating clip art, print art, logo design, charts, line art, etc. 
It costs around ` 25,000. The open source alternative is 
Inkscape, which allows users to create vector art.
AutoCAD is another proprietary software used for 
modelling and designing a range of products. It is mostly 
Proprietary software and their open source variants

Ten Popular Android Tablets
Android tablets are different 
Today, Android devices dominate the world in comparison 
to BlackBerry and Apple devices. There are many 
versions of Android, with additional functionality and new 
interfaces coming out every day. The Android platform 
has been made available under a developer-friendly open 
source licence that gives more freedom and flexibility 
to device manufacturers when designing their products. 
Android is different from iPhone, BlackBerry or Symbian 
in primarily two aspects—flexibility and diversity. Android 
is more user-friendly and, being open source, anyone can 
access and customise it as per their needs. 
Android tablets include almost all the key features found 
in a regular tablet PC, including office applications, games, 
Web browsers and many other programs. They are centred on 
applications or apps. Hence, the Android icons are prominent 
and the home screen is simple. You can delete and modify 
all the apps except the dialler, application tray and Web 
Earth. There are four buttons for navigation and a wonderful 
notification bar at the top of the screen. 
D
igitisation has made people everywhere use 
electronic devices like smartphones, computers and 
laptops to perform all kinds of tasks in a smarter way. 
Tablets are another way of accessing the Internet, playing 
games and communicating with others. They fit in your palm 
and are light enough to carry anywhere, easily. With a tablet, 
you can do as many things as you can with a computer or 
smartphone. You can browse the Web, play games, send and 
receive emails, and much more. 
A tablet is a thin, flat mobile computer with a 
touchscreen display and many other features. The 
touchscreen display recognises finger prints or gestures, 
which it takes as inputs, replacing the mouse and keyboard. 
It is also equipped with many advanced features and sensors 
including digital cameras, microphones, etc. Tablets are 
typically larger than smartphones with screens measuring 
17.8cm (7 inches) or more. They have the functionality 
of the modern smartphone and run on a dedicated mobile 
operating system. You can read a book that you have loaded 
onto the tablet, or you can play games and surf the Internet. 
If you are interested in purchasing a 
tablet, this article will point you to the ten 
most popular Android tablets and inform 
you on their strong points.

like how much are you willing to spend 
and whether you are prepared for a 
device that involves a sharp learning 
curve. Navigating an Android device 
is a learning experience. On the other 
hand, the operating system is friendlier 
and, being open source, you can tweak 
the settings and customise the device 
for yourself. Android tablets are 
budget-friendly, but there are dozens 
of different Android tablets from 
various manufacturers available on the 
market. The price of the tablet indicates 
the materials used to make it and the 
version of the operating system.
Top 10 popular Android 
tablets in the world
If you are looking for a tablet and 
thinking about buying an Android 
device, then there are many options for 
you. Let us look at some of the best-
known Android tablets (a comparison of 
these tablets is given in Table 1).
1. Google Pixel C
This is perhaps the best Android tablet 
at its price and comes with many special 
features. Google Pixel C has a fantastic 
display, a fast and powerful processor, 
and a premium design. However, it is 
a bit heavy to carry and expensive. Its 
keyboard dock is not fully utilised by 
the Android interface. This tablet is 
equipped with a very good touchscreen. 
It has a clean stock Android interface, 
metal body and a great screen. It comes 
with a big 25.9cm (10.2-inch) display, 
a 34.2WHr battery and the Android 
The widget is the key feature of 
Android tablets and includes weather, 
calendar, clock, GPS and Bluetooth. 
In addition, you can customise the 
Android tablet to suit your needs. Geeks 
often replace the entire functionality 
of the Android operating system with a 
custom read-only memory. 
Android tablet hardware
There are many varieties of Android 
tablets available in the market. You can 
find many differences between Android 
tablets because they are manufactured 
and designed by different companies. 
Hence, it is very difficult to sum up 
their specifications. Android tablets 
are really just specialised computers. 
In general, most tablets contain the 
following hardware components:
 
A processor
 
Memory chips
 
Bluetooth chip
 
FM tuner
 
At least one camera
 
A storage chip and possibly a slot 
for additional storage
 
A battery
 
A graphics processor
 
Speakers

the source code intact.
Figure 1 (courtesy: Wikipedia) will help us to visualise the 
program flow in Linux. The top portion of the figure is where 
the human/user interface happens and the bottom portion 
shows the machine interaction. It is above this other distros 
like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc are built. The processing speed of a 
computer is determined by the clock speed. The instruction 
to cycle that relay on clock speed are obviously fast and 
efficient. Remember, supercomputers are powered by Linux.
LaTex
In research, publication is a must in order to validate the 
work. With LaTex, you can write a journal or conference 
paper without worrying about its alignment. LaTex is capable 
of aligning books, your thesis or even your presentation 
slides. Learning LaTex can be a challenge, but a graphical 
user interface (GUI) like Tex Live can be used for easy 
learning. The file system in LaTex is open source. After 
installation, you can check your software package version in 
your computer by typing the following command in command 
line interface (CLI or terminal). The version I use is also

ngineering research demands a computation platform 
that is free from patents and it is not plagued by 
proprietary rules. It is all about innovation. Engineering 
complex systems and making significant contributions to any 
particular field of research is the key motive to any researcher. 
Budding researchers should build on existing research 
platforms without ambiguity. In this context, it is necessary to 
recognise the importance of open source software and GNU 
general public licence. The software tools I currently use in 
my research include Ubuntu−14.04−LTS, which is a Debian 
distribution built on OS Linux−3.19.0−61−generic kernel. 
The processor used is Intel N3540, which is a low wattage 
(TDP) processor with a decent clock frequency. The processor 
gives considerable battery backup and performance. 
The other handy open source software tools are.
Linux
Linux kernel 0.01 was released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. He 
wrote it in C programming language with a GCC compiler. It 
had 10,239 lines of code then. Now, it has more than 2 billion 
lines of code. An estimated 3 billion Android phones with the 
Linux kernel were sold in 2014. Almost all electronic devices 
support this code. Supercomputers and servers are run on 
Linux. They are so stable that upgrades are possible without 
even shutting them down. In 2005, Linus Torvalds said, “Linux 
is evolution, not intelligent design.” Hence, this portable

a proprietary software. Scilab is an open source equivalent 
of MATLAB. It was created in 1990 by researchers from 
INRIA and ENPC in France. It is freely available for all 
computation platforms (refer to my article in the January 
2017 issue of OSFY). The Scilab version in my computer is:

LibreOffice
We are all helplessly dependent on Microsoft Office. 
But the MS Office package comes with a price. MS 
Excel is the favourite of many engineers. Its equivalent 
is LibreOffice Calc, which helps in managing data 
adequately. Its limitations can be overcome with 
programming skills. Slide preparation and writing is 
bypassed by LaTex. My present version of LibreOffice is:

A dictionary is one of the overlooked components in any 
computer. It is good to have a dictionary handy. It is also 
possible to set shortcut keys of your favourite to access 
the word you want on your screen, at the click of a button. 
Artha works fine for my vocabulary skills.

Open source software is freely available for use to enterprises. It is a well known fact 
that major corporations and enterprises like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Bank of 
America and many others use open source software. This article highlights the open 
source software available to enterprises for different purposes.
Open Source in the Enterprise:  
A Change in the Climate
Open source in the enterprise 
– the change has begun
The enterprise segment is undergoing changes like never before 
with the advent of the cloud consumption model. There is a 
great push from customers for more cost-effective solutions.
Large organisations are looking at viable alternatives 
that allow more agility, helping them to stay ahead in the 
market by  innovating speedily. It is no surprise that reducing 
operational IT expenditure, while simultaneously increasing 
the level of security and software capabilities, is a top priority 
for most enterprises. Open source products and processes 
address all these requirements.
 
Greater transparency: Not only is the source code 
available, but all of the design deliberations  are out in the 
open, in contrast to the secretive processes of proprietary 
vendors. This transparency makes it easy to assess the 
product and its community before deciding whether to use it.
 
Greater innovation: Since open source solutions have a 
large community of experienced developers volunteering 
to work on them, the pace and level of innovation is

nterprise class IT is mainly characterised by the 
following key attributes—reliability, scalability, 
security, manageability and serviceability. The 
enterprise hardware and software stack needs to be highly 
reliable to cater to mission-critical workloads. The workload 
running on the enterprise IT infrastructure may require more 
resources from time to time; hence, it needs to be designed 
to scale seamlessly in all aspects. Since much crucial and 
confidential data is stored and analysed on IT machines, 
security becomes an important aspect of the IT infrastructure, 
which should be built with superior security features. 
Periodic updates are needed for the IT infrastructure 
in terms of software upgrades, bug fixes and hardware 
replacement. This demands that the enterprise IT 
infrastructure should have a swift serviceability policy.
Enterprise class IT typically consists of a large number 
of resources like servers, storage and networking and various 
software products running on them. Having simple and easy-
to-use manageability solutions will help in better resource 
utilisation and higher productivity.

A great advantage of open source is the ability to take 
the community versions, get started, understand whether 
they can solve your business problem, and begin to 
deliver value right away. Once you make that decision, 
professional support and services are increasingly 
available for open source products. This allows you to 
get the best of both worlds — flexibility, agility and the 
ability to get started quickly and inexpensively, with 
the option to mature to a large scale, fully supported, 
enterprise-grade implementation. And you don’t have to 
go over proprietary licensing hurdles to get there.
As per the Gartner report,‘Survey Analysis: Overview 
of Preferences and Practices in the Adoption and Usage 
of Open-Source Software, Gartner Reports, 2011’, more 
than half the organisations surveyed have adopted open 
source software (OSS) solutions as part of their IT strategy, 
with nearly one-thirds citing the benefits of flexibility, 
increased innovation, shorter development times and faster 
procurement processes. OSS makes up nearly one-third 
of the surveyed organisations’ overall enterprise software 
portfolio (applications and infrastructure). Interestingly, this 
is about the same as the proportion of internally developed 
software. The presence and the influence of open source 
software have expanded across software market segments 
over more than a decade. It’s pervasive in many areas of IT, 
and continues to emerge and expand across others at a steady 
pace. Consequently, mainstream IT organisations cannot 
ignore the influence and presence of OSS in their technology 
road maps (planned or unplanned). Those that do so, risk 
facing technical and legal nightmares, and might miss out 
on significant competitive business value, the Gartner report 
concluded.
Let us look at the top open source alternatives to some of 
the current proprietary enterprise components which can be 
adopted by large enterprises.
fast and continuous. This holds true in another way too 
—since anyone can contribute code, it allows an open 
source product to incorporate unusual use cases, which a 
proprietary vendor may either ignore or dismiss.
 
Cost-effectiveness: Open source solutions are generally 
much more cost-effective than proprietary solutions, and 
they also give enterprises the ability to start small and 
scale up (more on that coming up). Given that enterprises 
are often budget challenged, it just makes financial sense 
to explore open source solutions. 
 
Speed: Your enterprise will soon be competing on speed, 
if it isn’t already doing so. Open source enables speed.

Open source software in the enterprise
Operating system
The most popular choice for an open source operating system 
is Linux, due to its vast community support and adoption. 
There are multiple Linux distributions for enterprises, which 
vary in the packages bundled and the certified applications 
that accompany it. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE 
Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Oracle Linux and Ubuntu 
Enterprise Linux are a few.
Linux is also the favourite OS due to its support for 
container deployment features. 
machines at near-native speed (requiring hardware virtualisation 
extensions on x86 machines). QEMU can also be used purely for 
CPU emulation for user-level processes, allowing applications 
compiled for one architecture to be run on another.
Oracle VM VirtualBox (formerly Sun VirtualBox) is a 
free and open source hypervisor for x86 computers currently 
being developed by Oracle Corporation.  VirtualBox may be 
installed on a number of host operating systems, including 
Linux, OS X, Windows, Solaris and Open Solaris. There 
are also ports to FreeBSD and Genode. It also supports the 
creation and management of guest virtual machines that run 
versions and derivations of Windows, Linux, BSD, OS/2, 
Solaris, Haiku, OSx86 and limited virtualisation of OS X 
guests on Apple hardware. 
Para-virtualisation: It is also known as a Type 1 hypervisor, 
running directly on the hardware or ‘bare-metal’, and provides 
virtualisation services directly to the virtual machines running 
on it. It helps the operating system, the virtualised hardware, and 
the real hardware to collaborate to achieve optimal performance. 
These hypervisors typically have a rather small footprint and do 
not, themselves, require extensive resources.
Featured below are the top two open source para-
virtualisation products.
KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full 
virtualisation solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing 
virtualisation extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists 
of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core 
virtualisation infrastructure and a processor-specific module 
like kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.
Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines 
running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual 
machine has private virtualised hardware—a network card,

gate02/95/docker-overview-rise-of-the-containers-7-638.jpg?cb=1429267165)
Virtualisation software
The virtualisation method can be categorised based on how 
it mimics hardware to a guest operating system and emulates 
the guest operating environment. Primarily, there are three 
types of virtualisation:
• 
Emulation
• 
Para-virtualisation
• 
Container-based virtualisation
Emulation: Emulation, also known as full virtualisation, 
runs the virtual machine OS kernel entirely in software. The 
hypervisor used in this type is known as a Type 2 hypervisor. 
It is installed on top of the host operating system, which 
is responsible for translating the guest OS kernel code to 
software instructions. The translation is done entirely in 
software and requires no hardware involvement. Emulation 
makes it possible to run any non-modified operating system 
that supports the environment being emulated. The downside 
of this type of virtualisation is the additional system resource 
overhead that leads to a decrease in performance compared to 
other types of virtualisation.
Oracle VM VirtualBox and QEMU are the top choices for 
the emulation kind of virtualisation.
QEMU is a hosted virtual machine monitor. It emulates 
CPUs through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of 
device models, enabling it to run a variety of unmodified guest 
operating systems. It can also be used with KVM to run virtual

disk, graphics adapter, etc. The kernel component of KVM 
is included in mainline Linux, as of 2.6.20. The user space 
component of KVM is included in mainline QEMU, as of 
1.3. Blogs by people active in KVM-related virtualisation 
development are syndicated at http://planet.virt-tools.org/.
Xen hypervisor is an open source Type 1 or bare metal 
hypervisor, which makes it possible to run many instances 
of an operating system or different operating systems in 
parallel on a single machine (or host). The Xen Project 
hypervisor is the only Type 1 hypervisor that is available 
as open source. It is used as the basis for a number of 
different commercial and open source applications, such 
as server virtualisation, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), 
desktop virtualisation, security applications, and embedded 
and hardware appliances. The Xen Project hypervisor is 
powering the largest clouds in production today.
Container based virtualisation: Container based 
virtualisation, also known as operating system-level 
virtualisation, enables multiple isolated executions within 
a single operating system kernel. It has the best possible 
performance and density, while featuring dynamic resource 
management. The isolated virtual execution environment 
provided by this type of virtualisation is called a container 
and can be viewed as a traced group of processes. 
 
 
Containers have also sparked an interest in micro service 
architecture, a design pattern for developing applications in 
which complex applications are broken down into smaller 
pieces that work together. Each component is developed 
separately, and the application is then simply the sum of its 
constituent components. Each piece, or service, can reside 
inside a container, and can be scaled independently of the rest 
of the application as the need arises.  
Undoubtedly, one of the biggest reasons for the recent 
interest in container technology has been the Docker open 
source project, a command line tool that makes creating 
and working with containers easy for developers and sys 
admins alike, similar to the way Vagrant makes it easier for 
developers to explore virtual machines easily.
Docker is a command line tool for programmatically 
defining the contents of a Linux container in code, which can 
then be versioned, reproduced, shared and modified easily just 
as if it were the source code to a program.
Cloud platforms 
Cloud Foundry is the world’s leading open source Platform-
as-a-Service (PaaS) for continuous innovation 
The Cloud Foundry platform is available from either the 
Cloud Foundry Foundation as open source software, or from 
multiple commercial providers as a product or a service.
Cloud Foundry is open source software and, hence, 
available to anyone. Deploying it involves interfacing with 
the underlying infrastructure using the Cloud Foundry 
BOSH (bosh outer shell) deployment scripting language, 
another open source tool from Pivotal. The Baidu website is 
implemented on Cloud Foundry.
Orchestration tools
Based on the cloud platforms adopted, given below are some 
of the top orchestrators. 
Cloud Foundry’s Diego: Diego is a container 
management system that combines a scheduler, runner and 
health manager. It is a rewrite of the Cloud Foundry runtime.
Docker Swarm: Docker Swarm provides native clustering 
functionality for Docker containers, which lets you turn a group 
of Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker engine.
Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an orchestration system 
for Docker containers. It handles scheduling and manages 
workloads based on user-defined parameters.
Mesosphere Marathon: Marathon is a container 
orchestration framework for Apache Mesos that is designed 
to launch long-running applications. It offers key features for 
running applications in a clustered environment.
Big Data applications  
Apache Cassandra is a free and open source distributed 
database management system designed to handle large 
amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing 
high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra 
offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple data 
centres, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing 
low latency operations for all clients.
Hadoop is an open source, Java-based programming 
framework that supports the processing and storage of 
extremely large data sets in a distributed computing 
environment. It is part of the Apache project, sponsored by 
the Apache Software Foundation
Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing 
framework. Originally developed at the University of California, 
Berkeley’s AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to 
the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since. 
Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters 
with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance. It provides 
programmers with an application programming interface centred 
on a data structure called the resilient distributed dataset (RDD),

a read-only multi-set of data items distributed over a cluster of 
machines, which is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. It was 
developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster 
computing paradigm, which forces a particular linear data flow 
structure on distributed programs. MapReduce programs read 
input data from the disk, map a function across the data, reduce the 
results of the map, and store reduction results on the disk. Spark’s 
RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offer 
a (deliberately) restricted form of distributed shared memory. 
Databases
PostgreSQL is essentially a relational database, but with an 
object-oriented database model. Performance is nearly as fast 
as MariaDB and MySQL, but the biggest plus is PostgreSQL’s 
management interface called pgAdmin, which has a robust set 
of features that’s easy and intuitive to navigate.
MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL 
relational database management system intended to remain free 
under the GNU GPL. It is notable for being led by the original 
developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over 
its acquisition by Oracle. Contributors are required to share 
their copyright with the MariaDB Foundation. It intends to 
maintain high compatibility with MySQL, ensuring a ‘drop-
in’ replacement capability with library binary equivalence 
and exactly matches with MySQL APIs and commands. It 
includes the XtraDB storage engine for replacing InnoDB, as 
well as a new storage engine, Aria, that is intended to be both a 
transactional and non-transactional engine, perhaps even to be 
included in future versions of MySQL. 
MongoDB is the NoSQL database movement that came 
about to address the shortcomings of relational databases and 
the demands of modern software development. MongoDB is 
the leading NoSQL database, with significant adoption among 
the Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies. 
Application runtime environments
OpenJDK, PHP runtime and Apache Tomcat  are the most 
widely used open source application runtime environments 
based on the kind of workloads enterprise class IT runs.
OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and 
open source implementation of the Java platform, Standard 
Edition (Java SE). The implementation is licensed under 
the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) version 2 
with a linking exception. OpenJDK is the official reference 
implementation of Java SE since version 7. 
The OpenJDK project produces a number of components, 
most importantly, the virtual machine (HotSpot), the Java Class 
Library and the Java compiler (javac).
The Web browser plugin and Web Start, which form part 
of Oracle Java, are not included in OpenJDK. Sun previously 
indicated that it would try to open source these components, 
but neither Sun nor Oracle have done so. The only currently 
available free plugin and Web Start implementations, as of 
2016, are those provided by IcedTea. 
Apache Tomcat, often referred to as Tomcat Server, is an 
open source Java Servlet Container developed by the Apache 
Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements several Java 
EE specifications including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages 
(JSP), Java EL and WebSocket,  providing a ‘pure Java’ 
HTTP Web server environment in which Java code can run.
Tomcat is developed and maintained by an open 
community of developers under the auspices of the Apache 
Software Foundation, released under the Apache License 2.0, 
and is open source software.
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed 
primarily for Web development but is also used as a general-
purpose programming language. PHP originally stood for 
Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive 
acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. 
PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can 
be used in combination with various Web template systems, 
Web content management systems and Web frameworks. 
PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter 
implemented as a module in the Web server or as a Common 
Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The Web server 
combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP 
code, which may be any type of data, including images, with 
the generated Web page. PHP code may also be executed 
with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to 
implement standalone graphical applications. 
The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, 
is free software released under the PHP licence. PHP has been 
widely ported, and can be deployed on most Web servers on 
almost every operating system and platform, free of charge. 
Manageability software  
OpenDCIM is a free, Web based data centre infrastructure 
management (DCIM) application. While proprietary products 
dominate the DCIM solutions, OpenDCIM is the most 
promising open source alternative. 
While OpenDCIM doesn’t provide all the features 
available in commercial products, it covers a majority of them. 
OpenDCIM is not designed to compete with commercial 
products. Its biggest advantage is that it is effectively free for 
use. For data centres of almost any size, the tool is an effective 
introduction to DCIM concepts, and allows administrators to 
evaluate the utility of DCIM software in their own environments.
Open source hardware in the enterprise
Open compute project (OCP)
The Open Compute Project (OCP) is an organisation that 
shares designs of data centre products among companies, 
including Facebook, Intel, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Seagate 
Technology, Dell, Rackspace, Ericsson, Cisco, Juniper 
Networks, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Lenovo and Bank 
of America. It is a collaborative community focused on 
redesigning hardware technology to efficiently support the

Insight
growing demands on compute infrastructure.
In 2011, Facebook shared its designs with the public 
and—along with Intel, Rackspace, Goldman Sachs and 
Andy Bechtolsheim—launched the Open Compute Project, 
incorporating the Open Compute Project Foundation. The five 
members hoped to create a movement in the hardware space that 
would bring about the same kind of creativity and collaboration we 
see in open source software. And that’s exactly what’s happening.
The Open Compute community has multiple active open 
hardware streams. There are multiple designs available for 
storage, networking, servers, racks and general guidelines for 
designing a data centre.
RISC-V is an open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) 
and is delivered as a parameterised core generator. It has a 
small general-purpose base and multiple optional extensions, 
including reserved opcodes for unique SoC instructions.
Its goals are:
 
To become the industry-standard ISA for all 
computing devices.
 
To expand specifications for SoCs, including I/O 
and accelerators.
 
As most of the cost in chip design is the cost of the 
software, this architecture will try to ensure that this 
software can be reused across many chip designs.
 
Encourage both open source and proprietary 
implementations of the RISC-V ISA specifications.
RISC-V has been adopted by IIT Madras (and others too), 
and RISC-V chips are shipping commercially.
To summarise, enterprise class IT has evolved by adopting 
open source products and processes, resulting in more agility 
and helping organisations to stay ahead in the market with 
speedy innovations. It is no surprise that reducing operational 
IT expenditures, while simultaneously increasing the level of 
security and software capabilities, is a top priority for most 
enterprises. Open source addresses these concerns. Since 
enterprise open source comes with its own advantages and risks, 
one has to choose the right set of open source solutions to suit 
specific needs. Enterprises need to consider the advantages of open 
source and how it can help them improve their operations.

Open Gurus Overview
Data remains as raw text until it is mined and the information contained within it is harnessed. 
Mining data to make sense out of it has applications in varied fields of industry and academia. 
In this article, we explore the best open source tools that can aid us in data mining. 
Top 10 Open Source  
Data Mining Tools
into different user-defined categories.
Outlier analysis helps in identifying those data elements 
which are deviant or distant from the rest of the elements in a 
dataset. This can help in anomaly detection.
Associative analysis helps in bringing out hidden 
relationships among data items in a large data set. This can 
help in predicting the occurrence of a particular item in a 
transaction or an event whenever some other item is present. 
You can think of this as a conditional probability.
Regression is used to predict values of a dependent 
variable by constructing a model or a mathematical function 
out of independent variables.
Summarisation helps in coming up with a compact 
description for the whole data set.
Data mining is a combination of various techniques like 
pattern recognition, statistics, machine learning, etc. While 
there is a good amount of intersection between machine 
learning and data mining, as both go hand in hand and 
machine learning algorithms are used for mining data, we will 
restrict ourselves in this article to only those tools specialised 
for data mining.
Weka
Weka is a Java based free and open source software licensed 
under the GNU GPL and available for use on Linux, 
Mac OS X and Windows. It comprises a collection of 
D
ata mining, also known as knowledge discovery 
from databases, is a process of mining and analysing 
enormous amounts of data and extracting information 
from it. Data mining can quickly answer business questions 
that would have otherwise consumed a lot of time. Some of 
its applications include market segmentation – like identifying 
characteristics of a customer buying a certain product from 
a certain brand, fraud detection – identifying transaction 
patterns that could probably result in an online fraud, and 
market based and trend analysis – what products or services 
are always purchased together, etc. This article focuses on the 
various open source options available and their significance in 
different contexts.
A brief look at mining tasks
For those who are new to data mining, let’s take a brief look 
at some of the common mining tasks.
Pre-processing: This involves all the preliminary tasks 
that can help in getting started with any of the actual mining 
tasks. Pre-processing could be removing anomalies and noise 
from the data that’s about to be mined, filling in missing 
values, normalising the data or compressing data using 
techniques like generalisation and aggregation.
Clustering: This is partitioning a huge set of data into 
related sub-classes.
Classification: This is tagging or classifying data items

software and as well as a commercial version. Written in 
Java and built upon Eclipse, its access is through a GUI 
that provides options to create the data flow and conduct 
data pre-processing, collection, analysis, modelling and 
reporting. A Gartner survey reveals that customers are 
happy with the platform’s flexibility, openness and smooth 
integration with other software like Weka and R. Given the 
small size of the company, Knime has a large user base and 
an active community. It makes use of Eclipse’s extension 
mechanism capability to add plugins for the required 
functionalities like text and image mining. This software is 
ideal for enterprise use. 
DataMelt
DataMelt or DMelt does much more than just data mining. 
It is a computational platform, offering statistics, numeric 
and symbolic computations, scientific visualisation, etc. To 
avoid digressing from our topic, I’ll restrict myself to only 
covering its data mining capabilities. DMelt provides data 
mining features like linear regression, curve fitting, cluster 
analysis, neural networks, fuzzy algorithms, analytic 
calculations and interactive visualisations using 2D/3D 
plots and histograms. One can play around with its IDE 
(integrated development kit) or its functions can be called 
from applications using its Java API. Both community 
and commercial editions of DMelt are available on Linux, 
Mac OS, Windows and Android platforms. DMelt is a 
successor to the jHepWork and SCaVis programs, which 
some people working in data analysis might be familiar 
with. This software is well suited for students, engineers 
and scientists.
Apache Mahout
Mahout is primarily a library of machine learning algorithms that 
can help in clustering, classification and frequent pattern mining. 
It can be used in a distributed mode that helps easy integration 
with Hadoop. Mahout is currently being used by some of the 
giants in the tech industry like Adobe, AOL, Drupal and Twitter, 
and it has also made an impact in research and academics. It can 
be a great choice for anyone looking for easy integration with 
Hadoop and to mine huge volumes of data.
ELKI
ELKI is open source software written in Java and licensed 
under AGPLv3. This software focuses especially on 
cluster analysis and outlier detection with a compilation 
of numerous algorithms from both these domains. The 
software is accessed through a GUI that displays the results 
once the selected algorithm is run. ELKI’s design goals are 
performance, scalability, completeness, extensibility and a 
modular design to welcome contributions. ELKI currently 
doesn’t offer professional support and the software is 
optimised for use in science and research. Hence, this option 
works best for those in research.
machine learning algorithms for data mining. It packages 
tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, 
clustering, association rules and visualisation. The various 
ways of accessing it are – Weka Knowledge Explorer, 
Experimenter, Knowledge Flow and a simple CL. Explorer 
is a user-friendly graphical interface for two-dimensional 
visualisation of mined data. It lets you import the raw 
data from various file formats, and supports well known 
algorithms for different mining actions like filtering, 
clustering, classification and attribute selection. However, 
when dealing with large data sets, it is best to use a CL 
based approach as Explorer tries to load the whole data 
set into the main memory, causing performance issues. 
This software also provides a Java Appetiser for use in 
applications and can connect to databases using CJD. 
Weka has proved to be an ideal choice for educational and 
research purposes, as well as for rapid prototyping.
Rapid Miner
Rapid Miner is available in both FOSS and commercial 
editions and is a leading predictive analytic platform. Gartner, 
the US research and advisory firm, has recognised Rapid 
Miner and Knife as leaders in the magic quadrant for advanced 
analytic platforms in 2016. Rapid Miner is helping enterprises 
embed predictive analysis in their business processes with its 
user friendly, rich library of data science and machine learning 
algorithms through its all-in-one programming environments 
like Rapid Miner Studio. Besides the standard data mining 
features like data cleansing, filtering, clustering, etc, the 
software also features built-in templates, repeatable work 
flows, a professional visualisation environment, and seamless 
integration with languages like Python and R into work flows 
that aid in rapid prototyping. The tool is also compatible with 
weak scripts. Rapid Miner is used for business/commercial 
applications, research and education.
Orange
Python users playing around with data sciences might be 
familiar with Orange. It is a Python library that powers Python 
scripts with its rich compilation of mining and machine 
learning algorithms for data pre-processing, classification, 
modelling, regression, clustering and other miscellaneous 
functions. Orange also comes with a visual programming 
environment and its workbench consists of tools for importing 
data, and dragging and dropping widgets and links to connect 
different widgets for completing the workflow. The visual 
programming comes with an easy-to-use UI, with plenty of 
online tutorials for assistance. Due to the ease of programming 
and integration in Python, Orange can be a great take off point 
for novices and experts to plunge into data mining.
Knime
Knime is one of the leading open source analytic, 
integration and reporting platforms that comes as free

Open Gurus Overview
MOA
Massive Online Analysis (MOA), as the name suggests, is 
primarily data stream mining software that is well suited for 
applications that need to handle volumes of real-time data 
streams at a high speed. MOA is distributed under GNU 
GPL, and can be used via the command line, GUI or Java 
API. It is a rich compilation of machine learning algorithms 
and has proved to be a great choice during the design of 
real-time applications. Stream mining algorithms typically 
require faster computations without storing all of the 
datasets in the memory and have to get the work done within 
a limited time. MOA is well suited for these requirements. 
Weka and MOA can be closely linked to each other and 
either of the classifiers can be called from the other one. For 
those looking to analyse and mine information from real-
time data, MOA can be the best choice.
KEEL
KEEL (Knowledge Extraction for Evolutionary Learning) 
is a Java based open source tool distributed under GPLv3. 
It is powered by a well-organised GUI that lets you manage 
(import, export, edit and visualise) data with different file 
formats, and to experiment with the data (through its data pre-
processing, statistical libraries and some standard data mining 
and evolutionary learning algorithms). Since KEEL is based on 
Java, JVM has to be installed on the system to run its GUI and 
do data mining experiments. You may visit http://keel.es/ for the 
complete list of supported algorithms. KEEL is ideal for research 
and educational purposes. It serves as a useful aid for teachers.
Rattle
Rattle, expanded to ‘R Analytical Tool To Learn Easily’, has 
been developed using the R statistical programming language. 
The software can run on Linux, Mac OS and Windows, and 
features statistics, clustering, modelling and visualisation with 
the computing power of R. Rattle is currently being used in 
business, commercial enterprises and for teaching purposes in 
Australian and American universities.
All the tools and software discussed so far are not the 
only available ones—the list keeps growing. While I have 
covered only those tools exclusively meant for mining 
data, there are a few other machine learning, NLP and data 
analytic tools that could aid in mining, like scikit-learn, 
NLTK, GraphLab, Neural Designer, Pandas and SPMF, 
which readers could explore.

The Python language has been made lean and fast to run on 
microcontrollers. Beginners and experts can use it to control their 
electronics projects with ease.
An Introduction to 
MicroPython
up (upon first boot) to contain a file system. This file system 
uses the FAT format and is stored in the Flash memory by the 
MicroPython firmware. This gives users the benefit of being 
able to access, read and write files within the main Python 
program for flexible storage operations. 
There are two files that are treated specially by the 
ESP8266 when it starts up: boot.py and main.py. The boot.
py script is executed first (if it exists) and once it completes, 
the main.py script is executed. You can create these files 
yourself and populate them with the code that you want to 
run when the device starts up. boot.py generally contains the 
boot parameters, like whether to have serial debugging on 
or off, which Wi-Fi AP to connect, the main code to run, etc. 
Looping stays in main.py, e.g., the logic for blinking LEDs.
It is also worth noting that microcontrollers are generally 
programmed in C, wherein direct registers are accessed and 
manipulated to use the peripherals of the microcontrollers. 
The firmware code is cross-compiled and built for the target 
microcontroller architecture, and is flashed using a suitable 
programmer. MicroPython abstracts all these steps, but the 
constraint here is the real-time feature of microcontrollers, 
in general. Hence, MicroPython is not suitable for strict real-
time applications.
Boards supported by MicroPython
There are numerous boards/chipsets supported by MicroPython, 
and more are expected to do so in the near future as the project 
T
he MicroPython project is an open source 
implementation of Python 3 that includes a small subset 
of the Python standard libraries, and is optimised to run 
on microcontrollers with constrained environments like limited 
ROM, RAM and processing power. It came about after a 
successful Kick-starter campaign by Damien George. 
What is MicroPython?
MicroPython includes the standard Python interpreter 
that runs on small embedded development boards. With 
MicroPython, you can write Python scripts to control 
hardware. For example, you can make LEDs blink, 
communicate with a temperature sensor, control motors and 
publish a sensor reading on the Internet. It is worth noting that 
the firmware for such embedded devices is generally coded in 
Assembly, C or C++, but using MicroPython you can achieve 
almost the same results as with high level Python.
What MicroPython is not
Unlike the desktop version of Python, MicroPython is a 
stripped down version for microcontrollers; therefore, it 
doesn’t support all the Python libraries and functionalities. In 
the world of microcontrollers, the firmware is directly burned 
to the ROM (also known as program memory), and there is no 
file system. MicroPython implements a minimal type of file 
system directly on the Flash memory of the microcontrollers. 
If the device has 1MB or more of storage, then it will be set

Library stacks supported by MicroPython
Python supports a variety of libraries on desktop computers, 
but porting them directly to a microcontroller is not an easy 
task as they are not optimised for running on machines with 
less RAM. Instead of making existing useful Python libraries 
available in MicroPython, they are stripped in order to be 
better optimised to run on constrained hardware. The current 
libraries supported by MicroPython are named with the initial 
u, which stands for the Micro Library implementation:
 
 ucollections – collection and container types
 
uhashlib – hashing algorithm
 
uheapq – heap queue algorithm
 
 uio – input/output streams
 
 ujson – JSON encoding and decoding
 
 uos – basic ‘operating system’ services
 
 ure – regular expressions
 
 usocket – socket module
 
 ustruct – pack and unpack primitive data types
 
 utime – time related functions
 
 uzlib – zlib decompression
MicroPython-specific libraries
Functionality specific to the MicroPython implementation is 
available in the following libraries.
 
 machine — for functions related to the board
 
 micropython – to access and control MicroPython 
internals
 
 network — for network configuration
 
 uctypes – to access binary data in a structured way
Libraries specific to pyboard
The following libraries are specific to pyboard:
 
pyb — for functions related to the board
 
 Time related functions
 
 Reset related functions
 
 Interrupt related functions
 Note: The full list of supported libraries can be found at 
the MicroPython website.
Loading MicroPython on an ESP8266 board
ESP8266 is a cheap Wi-Fi development board. Since 
MicroPython exposes all the required APIs, including 
the networking stack, this chip is our preferred choice for 
learning how to load MicroPython. The ESP8266 raw chip 
matures. The current board support list is given below.
 
pyboard
 
This is the official MicroPython board, which comes 
with full MicroPython support out-of-the-box. It 
features a STM32F405RGT6 ARM Cortex M4 based 
processor. MicroPython supports APIs for almost all 
hardware peripherals of the chip like GPIO, i2c, SPI, 
UART, etc. 
Figure1: MicroPython Kick-starter campaign
Figure 2: The PyBoard
Figure 3: ESP826
Figure 4: BBC micro:bit
 
ESP8266
 
MicroPython support for the low cost Wi-Fi development 
ESP8266 microcontroller is excellent. Wi-Fi and 
Internet accessibility are made available within 
MicroPython using a special network library. There’s also 
a Web-based REPL that allows you to run MicroPython 
code on ESP8266 by using a Web browser within a local 
network.
 
BBC micro:bit
 
This is a great new board that is aimed at teaching kids 
computer programming. With MicroPython on the 
micro:bit, you can access the board’s peripherals like 
LEDs, accelerometers, etc.

modules require a USB to 
TTL converter and a 3.3-
volt stable power source to 
interact with the computer. 
Hence, we can use a 
complete ESP8266 board 
like NodeMCU or Adafruit 
Feather HUZZAH, which 
have all the necessary components on the same board.
To flash the MicroPython firmware binary on the 
ESP8266 board, a handy command line tool known as esptool 
can be used. It can be downloaded directly from the Python 
package manager using the following commands:
sudo pip install esptool
Check for the serial port after connecting the board it is /
dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART in our case
ls /dev/tty* can help you identify it.
esptool.py --port “serial_port” erase_flash
esptool.py --port “serial_port” --baud 460800 write_flash 
--flash_size=detect 0 “firmware_file”
Here, the firmware file .bin should be kept in the current 
working directory:

Using the serial REPL (Read Evaluate 
Print Loop)
Just like flashing MicroPython to the board, its REPL can be 
accessed over the serial port. Simply connect your MicroPython 
compatible board, the ESP8266 board in this case, and it will 
mount as a Serial Device (COMMxx in Windows and /dev/
ttySiLabs in OSX and Linux). Use any serial emulator like Putty 
(on Windows), minicom or screen on Linux/OSX to access the 
serial REPL, using the baud rate 115200, as follows:
sudo screen /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART 115200
or
sudo minimum -D /dev/ttySLAB_USBtoUART 
 
In Windows use Putty, for which the serial to be used is 
COMMxx (xx=COMM port number under Device Manager) 
and baud rate is 115200.
If everything goes well, you will see the familiar Python 
prompt, at which point you can write Python commands and 
view the immediate outputs. Type ‘print (“Hello World!”)’, 
and yes, it’s the same old Python that we love.
sudo screen /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART 115200

Using WebREPL
One unique feature of MicroPython on the boards which 
support networking (like ESP8266) is a WebREPL (read-
evaluate-print loop, like a Python ‘command line’) that is 
accessible through a Web page.  Instead of using a serial 
connection to the board, you can run Python code directly 
from your browser in a simple terminal. You don’t even need 
to connect the board to a Wi-Fi network; it can create its 
own network, which you can use to access the WebREPL! 
The new releases of MicroPython come with WebREPL 
disabled by default; so use the following commands to 
enable it over serialREPL:
>>> import webrepl_setup
WebREPL daemon auto-start status: disabled
Would you like to (E)nable or (D)isable it running on boot?
(Empty line to quit)
> E
To enable WebREPL, you must set password for it
New password: python
Confirm password: python
Changes will be activated after reboot
Would you like to reboot now? (y/n) y
Once it’s enabled, ESP8266 will start in AP mode 
and create a hotspot. You can connect to it with the 
password micropythoN and access WebREPL using the IP 
ws://192.168.4.1:8266/. Enter the password that you’ve 
set earlier. The WebREPL client can be accessed by going 
to http://micropython.org/webrepl/ or downloading it 
via GitHub (https://codeload.github.com/micropython/
webrepl/zip/master).

Using tools to 
make life easy with 
MicroPython
Adafruit MicroPython Tool 
(Ampy): This is a utility to 
interact with a MicroPython 
board over a serial 
connection.
Ampy is meant to be a 
simple command line tool to 
manipulate files and run code 
on a MicroPython board over 
its serial connection. With 
it, you can send files from your computer to a MicroPython 
board’s file system, download files from a board to your 
computer, and even send a Python script to a board to be 
executed. Download Ampy using Python Pip.
sudo pip3 install adafruit-ampy
Transfer files from PC to board using Ampy and vice 
versa, as follows:
ampy --port “serial_port” put “file_name.py”
ampy --port “serial_port” get “file_name.py”
iAyan:~ iAyan$ ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART get boot.py
# This file is executed on every boot (including wake-boot 
from deepsleep)
#import esp
#esp.osdebug(None)
import gc
import webrepl
webrepl.start()
gc.collect()
iAyan:~ iAyan$ ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART put main.py 
iAyan:~ iAyan$ ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART ls
boot.py
webrepl_cfg.py
main.py
Figure 6: Screenshot 1
Figure 7: Screenshot 2
This is handy to transfer main.py file to board which will run 
as board boots after boot.py file.
Hardware tinkering with MicroPython
Hardware hacking - GPIO: Connect the positive side, i.e., 
the anode of the LED to pin no. 15 on the ESP8266 board via 
a 330-ohm resistor and the negative side or the cathode (the 
shorter leg) to the ground pin.
import machine
import time
pin_number = 15
pin = machine.Pin(pin_number, machine.Pin.OUT)
while True:
 
pin.high()
 
time.sleep(1)
 
pin.low()
 
time.sleep(1)
Networking with MicroPython
Networking is a powerful feature of microcontrollers today, 
thanks to the IoT era. ESP8266 is known to be a low cost Wi-Fi 
development board and, thanks to MicroPython, it exposes the 
required APIs to access networking on the ESP8266 board.
Here’s a script to connect your board to your router and 
open the gate to the Internet:
>>> import network
>>> AP_NAME = “ “
>>> PASSWORD = “ “
>>> ap = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
>>> ap.active(True)
#5 ets_task(4020ed88, 28, 3fff9708, 10)
>>> ap.connect(AP_NAME, PASSWORD)
>>> ap.ifconfig()
(‘192.168.1.127’, ‘255.255.255.0’, ‘192.168.1.1’, 
‘192.168.1.1’
Congratulations! ESP8266 is now a device on your 
local network with just five lines of Python code. Now you 
can access WebREPL over this IP address.

Dell Opts for Open Source to  
Deliver Efficient Systems  
Management to Enterprises
helping enterprise customers manage their servers through Out-
of-Band (OOB) management. Known as iDRAC, the in-house 
technology for PowerEdge servers offers efficient and effective 
server management without requiring any operating system.
The engineering team at Dell EMC has designed the 
integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) with the 
LifeCycle Controller (LC) as an intelligent subsystem within 
servers to provide agentless OOB monitoring, management, 
configuration and updates. The company also provides IT 
administrators with its Chassis Management Controller (CMC) 
to deliver real-time monitoring of consolidated multiple blade 
servers and shared components in a Dell chassis.
Each of the Dell PowerEdge servers is shipped with the 
iDRAC, which leverages open standards and open source 
technologies. This helps the company offer faster development, 
reduced time-to-market and improved scalability over any 
proprietary and closed source development.
The Dell Power Edge Server’s Out-of-Band management solution has been 
developed using various open source technologies to deliver cost-effective 
systems management for enterprise IT environments.
W
hen it comes to systems management in 
enterprises, several time consuming tasks are 
involved. Earlier, embedded solutions backed 
by some proprietary technologies seemed efficient and 
effective as customers were only looking at meeting the 
requirements through a particular technology. But the cost 
and flexibility of those solutions have today become the 
key factors driving customer decisions on what technology 
to opt for. The open standards, open architecture and open 
source technology based solutions come with improved 
time-to-market as well as enhanced affordability and 
scalability. And they come without the burden of vendor 
lock-in and the resultant huge costs.
Much before the market was fully ready for open source 
solutions, Dell opted for open standards and open architecture 
for its brand, PowerEdge. This is designed with ‘open, 
affordable, reliable and scalable’ architecture, and is aimed at 
The engineering team at Dell EMC

large number of enterprise customers. The iDRAC, LC and 
CMC have the Linux OS that hosts the entire embedded 
management stack running on a dedicated SoC (System-
on-Chip) residing on a server motherboard. Likewise, the 
OOB management software supports DMTF (distributed 
management task force) specifications that include WS-MAN 
as well as Redfish, both of which provide a programmatic 
interface for any application to interact with iDRAC and 
CMC. The hardware platform management level, on the other 
hand, is based on open standards IPMI (intelligent platform 
management interface) specifications to enable connectivity 
and management of various on-board devices and sensors. 
“The beauty of the solution is standard and custom-specific 
hardware implementation that is exposed via standard 
interfaces. Dell takes care of bridging these two through its 
own software,” notes Raveendra Padala.
Challenges transform into opportunities
As is the case when constructing any complex solution, 
the development of the OOB solution also presented a few 
challenges for the engineering team at Dell. The first challenge 
was identifying the right standards, specifications and 
technologies around systems management. The idea was to 
design and implement Dell’s core solution with its own added 
capabilities that could be exported via standard interfaces 
using open source or Dell software.
“The primary challenge was with open source, since many 
community-based solutions are not fully up to enterprise 
standards,” Rama says, adding that the change management 
through open source solutions was also not in line with actual 
market dynamics. The engineers behind the OOB monitoring also 
found it tough to build a complete solution or software stack using 
open source technologies due to various IP constraints. However, 
Dell considered all this as an opportunity and planned a strategy to 
address customer needs. “We worked with the community to have 
patches for the open source solutions based on real-time field or 
customer use case situations,” reveals Raveendra Padala.
Dell engineers contributed to mod-WSMAN and up-
streamed various patches to the original code. The same 
“Open standards and open source solutions make our 
solutions fit into the theme of RAS (reliable, affordable and 
scalable). We always want to win customers based on the 
value and efficient technology that we provide, not to lock 
in customers with proprietary solutions,” says Ramakrishna 
Rama, director of software engineering, Dell.
Rama is leading the embedded management 
development team in India for Dell EMC that works on OOB 
management systems. The team utilises the Linux kernel 
and various open source drivers to provide efficient systems 
management to enterprise customers. “We build superior 
systems management capabilities on PowerEdge with a 
combination of our own and open source code to make it 
easy for enterprises to deploy, configure, update, monitor 
and maintain their server models in an almost seamless 
manner. This significantly reduces the cost involved in IT 
infrastructure deployment and operations, when compared to 
complete proprietary or closed solutions,” Rama says.
Unlike in the past, when IT admins were required to perform 
firmware updates by physically accessing several different 
servers at their premises, the present environment needs a 
self-regulation system with built-in intelligence and automation 
capabilities. This can become possible by using an advanced 
product mix such as the iDRAC with LC and CMC by Dell.
Server lifecycle management without 
any agent participation
The iDRAC with LC technology supposedly gives 
enterprises a single way to manage their business-critical 
server or IT infrastructures, at all times, from anywhere. 
The technology enables administrators to remotely perform 
lifecycle management of Dell PowerEdge servers from any 
location, without requiring any agent participation. Moreover, 
it accomplishes the given tasks regardless of the operating 
system or the presence and state of the hypervisor.
“Our solutions come with interoperability and, thereby, 
increase their market footprint. Along with reducing the 
cost of development and time-to-market, we have built 
the OOB management solution based on open standards/
open source interfaces to enable customers an easy way to 
integrate applications and environments,” Rama told Open 
Source For You.
Rama works along with Ravindran Chandra, a senior 
engineering manager, and Raveendra Reddy Padala, platform 
software staff engineer, at the Dell India R&D Centre in 
Bengaluru to improve OOB management for enterprise 
customers. “The blend of solving customer problems with 
our own, and the open standards based solutions used for this 
is the engineering culture of our team,” says Chandra.
Open source technologies are the 
key to success
Dell has been using various open source developments 
to make its OOB management solution compatible for a 
Dell India R&D Centre in Bengaluru

approach has also been followed in the case of Redfish DMTF 
specifications and related open source. The engineering team 
has also brought in some OEM extensions of the standards, to 
add features that are not available in traditional standards.
Dell India contributes over 40 per cent
While the iDRAC with LC and CMC products that are 
part of the OOB management solution was the brainchild 
of global Dell engineers, the team based in India accounts 
for more than 40 per cent of the worldwide development of 
this solution. This highlights the Dell India team’s product 
engineering skills related to IP creation, as well as its 
capabilities in contributing to the open source community.
Contributing back to the community
While consuming open source software, Dell’s OOB solution 
teams in India and in the US contribute to nearly 50 open 
source packages by interacting with several maintainers 
directly. There are product development teams that identify the 
potential of available open source packages and pick the most 
efficient ones to enhance server manageability. Further, Dell 
has created an internal server software open source software 
review (SSOR) team that includes volunteers from different 
project units to oversee existing open source integration 
activities. The same team is also responsible for evaluating 
requests for new open source package integration.
The group of engineers under the SSOR team prototype 
and evaluate open source package usage in the product. Also, 
they archive the requests for evaluation and all the related 
material for future references. It is mandatory to stream the 
open source code used in the existing products for community 
consumption within 30 days of the product GA (general 
availability) release. “We contribute to open source through 
various proposals as well as release the code of some of 
our in-house developed modules catering to open standards 
frameworks. We also raise issues and propose various solutions 
by participating in many open source communities working on 
systems and server management standards, Linux, Web servers 
and embedded tools used for manageability,” Rama states.
So, in this way, Dell not just consumes open source 
but also contributes back to the community with its 
innovative solutions.

TIPS
TRICKS
&
Searching the History command using 
Control+R
I strongly believe that what I’m going to recommend may 
well become your most frequently-used feature of History. 
When you’ve already executed a very long command, you 
can simply search History using a keyword and re-execute 
the same command without having to type it fully.
Press Control+R and type the keyword. In the 
following example, I searched for red, which displayed the 
previous command cat /etc/redhat-release in History, which 
contained the word red.
Pressing Ctrl+R from the command prompt will display 
the reverse-i-search prompt shown below:
(reverse-i-search)`red': cat /etc/redhat-release
Note: Pressing Enter when you see your command 
will execute it from History.
# cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS release 6.4 (Final)
Sometimes you want to edit a command from History 
before executing it; for example, you can search for httpd, 
which will display the service httpd stop from the command 
history. Select this command and change the Stop to Start, 
and re-execute it again as shown below.
(reverse-i-search)`httpd': service httpd stop
Now press either the left arrow or right arrow key when 
you see your command, and this will display the command 
for you to edit before executing it, as follows:
# service httpd start
 
Now let us see how we can use the previous command 
quickly using four different methods.
Sometimes, you may end up repeating the previous 
commands for various reasons. The following are the four 
different ways to repeat the last executed command.
1. Use the up arrow to view the previous command and 
press Enter to execute it.
2. Type ‘!!’ and press Enter from the command line.
3. Type ‘!-1’ and press Enter from the command line.
4. Pressing Ctrl+P will display the previous command. 
Then press Enter to execute it.
Examples:
# !ps
ps aux | grep 
apache   25452  0.1  0.2 454232 18524 ?        S    08:58   
0:32 /usr/sbin/httpd
apache   25754  0.1  0.2 454232 18496 ?        S    09:07   
0:31 /usr/sbin/httpd
apache   25783  0.1  0.3 461520 25796 ?        S    09:08   
0:31 /usr/sbin/httpd
Hope you enjoy this trick and I hope to soon share 
more of them with you.

Deleting a lot of files from a Linux directory
When we have a lot of files in a directory, regular 
commands such as rm * fail, giving the following error:
 "argument list too long"
This is because the * is replaced by the list of all 
file names in that directory before the rm command 
gets executed.
If it is okay to rename the directory and create a new 
one with the same name, permissions and ownerships, then 
this is one way of doing it. Ensure the relevant services 
which use this directory are restarted in this case.
If it is not okay to rename the directory, we can use the 
Find command as follows from within that directory:
find . -delete
The above command is much faster than the following:
find .  -exec rm {}  \;
If we want to remove only the files but not directories, 
use the command given below:
find . -type f -delete
One common scenario in which this is helpful is when 
removing a lot of spam mails from a mail directory.

Setting a process for CPU affinity
CPU affinity means binding a process to a given set 
of CPUs.  Let us check the CPU affinity for a process. 
First, let’s find the PID of the process to be checked. In the 
case of my example, the PID is 22353 and its CPU affinity 
is set to CPU 0.
[root@Linux-Test1 ~]# ps -a
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
22353 pts/1    00:00:02 dd
Now let’s check the affinity, using the following code:
[root@Linux-Test1 ~]# taskset -cp 22353
pid 22353's current affinity list: 0
The example below shows how to change the CPU 
affinity of a running process to CPU 1.
[root@Linux-Test1 ~]# taskset -pc 1 22353    
pid 22353's current affinity list: 0
pid 22353's new affinity list: 1
To run a new program on a specific CPU, use the 
following commands:
#taskset -c 0 myscript.sh              <-- This will run the 
script on CPU 0.
#taskset -c 0,1 myscript.sh          <-- In this case it will 
use multiple cores[CPU 0 &1].
#taskset -c 0-4 myscript.sh         <--  It will run on 
multiple cores [CPU 0,1,2,3]. 
Hope this information on CPU affinity will help you 
run an application on multi-core processors.

Back up and restore file permissions
Here is a tip to back up and restore file permissions 
in Linux.
To take a backup, go to the required directory (here we 
take /) and use the following command:  
getfacl -R . > permissions.txt
To restore a file, use:
setfacl --restore=permissions.txt

What is a live DVD??
A live CD/DVD or live disk contains a bootable 
operating system, the core program of any computer, 
which is designed to run all your programs and manage 
all your hardware and software.
Live CDs/DVDs have the ability to run a complete, 
modern OS on a computer even without secondary 
storage, such as a hard disk drive. The CD/DVD directly 
runs the OS and other applications from the DVD drive 
itself. Thus, a live disk allows you to try the OS before 
you install it, without erasing or installing anything on 
your current system. Such disks are used to demonstrate 
features or try out a release. They are also used for 
testing hardware functionality, before actual installation. 
To run a live DVD, you need to boot your computer 
using the disk in the ROM drive. To know how to set 
a boot device in BIOS, please refer to the hardware 
documentation for your computer/laptop.
