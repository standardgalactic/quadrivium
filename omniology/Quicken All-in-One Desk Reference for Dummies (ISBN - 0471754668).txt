Introduction
I
have a few paragraphs here to tell you what makes this book different
from other Quicken books and to encourage you to add this book to your
library. I’ve been a devoted Quicken user since the 1980s. Sometimes I
wonder how I managed to keep track of my finances at all before Quicken
came along. I can’t think of a better way to remain totally aware of all
aspects of my personal finances than by using this program.
Not only does Quicken provide you with an electronic storage area for all of
your bank account transactions — and trust me, saving more than 10 years
worth of financial data in one place, with easy access to comparative reports
and charts is not something you can re-create out of the boxes of cancelled
checks gathering dust in your closet — but the program is so much more
than that.
Quicken is an investment tracker, a retirement planner, a home budget
minder, a bill payer, a monitor for credit cards, a business organizer, a tax
saver, and, oh yeah, a bank account supervisor — all rolled into one neat
little package. And using Quicken, you feel like you have a firm grip on all of
the numbers that flow through your accounts.
But there’s another side to Quicken: financial savvy. Not only do you want 
to know how much money you have in the bank and in your investment
accounts, but you also want to know how you’re going to plan for the use of
that money 10, 20, or 30 years from now. Maybe you want to send your kids
to college, save for your retirement, buy a house, or experiment with the
stock market. Or you want to raise your credit rating, take a trip every now
and then, keep your bills under control, and still pay your taxes.
With the help of this book, you can look at the big picture. You can stop
tracking results of past financial activities and start planning for the results
you want to see in your financial future. “A personal finance manifesto” is
how my editor and I described this book when we first discussed the vision
we had: a book that would transcend the “how-to” and delve into the “why”
of financial record-keeping.
I hope you find that this book has lived up to that vision. And I hope you
decide to add this book to your library.

About This Book

About This Book
The Quicken All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies is a reference book,
not meant to be read in any particular order. Just as you would pick up a gar-
dening book and look to the Table of Contents and the Index for the particu-
lar flowers or shrubs about which you want to know more, I envision you
picking up this book and seeking a path to the financial topics you want to
study.
You’ll notice that, unlike many other Quicken books on the market, this book
does not refer to a specific version of the Quicken program. Although I’ve
used the most up-to-date version of the program for my illustrations and
examples, I’ve tried to make the book all-encompassing and useful to owners
of any version of Quicken. After all, the rules for basic data entry in Quicken
programs over the years have changed very little. I’ve tried to encompass
that continuity and produce a book that can be read by more than the small
group who happened to purchase the current model.
When it comes to finding your way around, I hope you’ll refer to the Table
of Contents and the Index extensively, as they have been constructed with
logic and significance in mind. They should lead you directly to the parts of
the book that provide you with the information you need.
I strived to avoid redundancy in this book, and yet there are certainly times
when one topic requires material from another topic to make an explanation
understandable. In these cases, I included cross-references to other parts of
the book where you can flip to if you want related or, in some cases, more 
in-depth information.
Foolish Assumptions
I made only a handful of assumptions about the readers of this book (that
means you). I don’t make any assumptions at all about the state of your per-
sonal finances. And I don’t expect you to be financial experts, CPAs, CFOs,
AARPs, PETAs, Republicans, Army veterans, or members of any other group.
I do expect the following:
✦You have some finances. Maybe you have a checking account, a savings
account, and a retirement plan at work. Maybe you are thinking about
buying some stock. Maybe you’re worried about being able to afford col-
lege or wondering how you’ll ever survive when you want to retire. It
doesn’t matter what kind of financial scenario you have; it only matters
that you have some money that you want to keep track of.

How This Book Is Organized
3
✦You have a PC with enough memory to run Quicken. An Internet connec-
tion is handy but not an absolute necessity.
✦You own or are about to acquire a version, any version, of Quicken, and
you plan to use that program to keep track of your finances.
That’s it.
How This Book Is Organized
The Quicken All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies is a compendium of eight
separate books, each covering a completely different aspect of Quicken and
personal finances. The minibooks all get along together and freely talk about
each other behind their respective backs, but you might find that some books
are more to your liking than others, and nobody’s going to mind if that hap-
pens. Here’s a rundown of what you can expect in each of the books.
Book I: Personal Finance Basics
I take back everything I said about your needing to have Quicken. You don’t
even need Quicken for Book I: This is all about finances and nothing about
computers. The idea behind Book I is to get you up to speed on a variety of
basic areas of personal finance — areas that can then be translated into
Quicken in later books. This personal finance minibook provides you with
essential information about earning and spending your money, borrowing
money, improving your credit score, budgeting, shopping for insurance, and
saving for college and retirement.
Book II: Quicken Basics
It doesn’t matter if you’ve never used Quicken before. Book II provides all
the basic how-to information necessary for setting up your finances in
Quicken and learning the ropes. You discover how to install Quicken, set up
your bank accounts, enter transactions, and reconcile your bank account.
You also find out about the world of online banking and how to get your own
accounts set up for online services, if that interests you.
Book III: Investments
One of the main reasons people purchase Quicken software is to track their
investments. In Book III, you see how to do just this. You can enter all of your
investment holdings in Quicken, monitor the performance of your invest-
ments, and even use Quicken to keep an eye on investments you’re consider-
ing for future purchases.

Book IV: Household Finances
Discover how you can use Quicken to help keep your debt to a minimum,
stay on top of your credit card spending, reconcile your credit card
accounts, save money on your mortgage, and keep track of your personal
belongings for insurance purposes. Find out about Quicken’s online bill pay-
ment services, and see how you can create a budget that really works.
Book V: Taxes
You’re going to love owning Quicken when it comes time to prepare your tax
return. Book V shows you how to enter information in Quicken that can be
readily transferable to your tax return. No more burning the midnight oil in
mid-April. Your tax return can be completed in January if you take advantage
of the tax features offered in Quicken. See how to produce reports that pro-
vide the information you need for your tax return, and, if you like, find out
how you can transfer your Quicken data right over to TurboTax to produce
your tax return right on your own computer. Tax-planning tips round out this
book that is all about individual income taxes.
Book VI: Retirement Planning and Other Saving
In Book VI, you see how to monitor your retirement saving in Quicken and
receive some basic planning tools to help determine how much money you
need for retirement, and how long it’s going to take you to acquire that
money. You also get familiar with the rules for withdrawing money from
your tax-deferred retirement accounts and find out about receiving Social
Security benefits and other joys of retirement. Book VI also presents infor-
mation about saving for college, including 529 plans and other long-term
savings opportunities.
Book VII: Quicken Reports
One of the primary reasons for using Quicken is to assemble all of your
financial information in such a way that it can be easily accessed. When you
produce reports in Quicken, you provide the tools for real financial planning
and analysis. Find out about the standard reports that come with Quicken
and how those reports can be useful to you. Then discover how you can cus-
tomize Quicken’s reports so that you get the exact information you need to
make informed decisions about your finances.
Book VIII: Small Business Finances
Quicken is the first choice of many small businesses when it comes to track-
ing business finances. You can create customer invoices in Quicken, prepare
estimates and track individual job performance, record and track accounts
receivable and accounts payable, generate a payroll for your employees,

record fixed assets, and produce reports that show you how your business
is doing.
Appendixes
These tips and tools really relate to all of your Quicken use, so I decided 
to create a series of appendixes on the Web for this information. The Web
site for Quicken All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, which is located at
www.dummies.com/go/quickenaio, includes the following appendixes:
✦Backing Up Data: Find out how to back up data on-site and off-site, and
about online storage of your backed-up data files.
✦Aggravating Things About Quicken: I love the program, but that 
doesn’t mean Quicken is perfect. Here are a few of my pet peeves, and
an opportunity for you to submit your own.
✦Resources for Personal Finance: The Internet is full of outstanding
resources for personal financial information. Here are a few noteworthy
and useful sites.
✦Getting Help with Quicken: If you’re looking for answers to sticky 
questions, and can’t find them here, try the variety of support sources
offered by Intuit, the folks who brought you Quicken.
Icons Used in This Book
Watch for these little pictures; they point the way to important information
as you go along.
Tips can help you work smarter and faster. Look for the Tip icon to tell you
short cuts and easy ways to make your Quicken experience more fun and
more productive.
This icon saves you the trouble of digging out your yellow highlighter. The
Remember points are important little tidbits that I want to make sure you
don’t overlook.
If you neglect to pay attention to these bits of important information, I get to
say, “I told you so!” when things go wrong!
These technical points tell you why Quicken is doing what it’s doing, or why
certain rules exist. There’s not a lot of nerdy technical information in this
book, but where it exists, I’ve tried to set it aside with this icon.

Quicken, and good luck with your future of excellent financial planning!

Chapter 1: Earning Income
and Investing
In This Chapter
 Earning income from your job
 Getting income from a job you invented
 Collecting earnings from your savings and investments
F
anny Price, the protagonist of Jane Austen’s novel Mansfield Park, knew a
thing or two about income: She said, “A large income is the best recipe
for happiness I ever heard of.” The information presented in this chapter may
not guarantee you happiness or a large income, but you figure out the ins and
outs of where income comes from and how to keep track of it all. And that, at
least, is a good first step in a recipe for managing your personal finances.
Making Money at Your Job
Work. We spend our childhood merrily going to school, playing in the yards
of our youth, practicing scales and etudes, pitching balls on sandlots, making
and losing friends, collecting our allowance money, getting tucked in at night,
and doing it all over again, day after endless day. When we’re really little, the
concept of work is limited to something our parents do when we’re not look-
ing. Later, work gets thrown in our face as an empty threat: “Someday you’ll
have to work for a living, and then you’ll understand . . . .”
Then comes the day when the allowance ends, there are no more exams, the
yards all need mowing, the piano keys are dusty, the sandlots have been
turned into parking garages, and our friends have moved on. Seemingly
overnight, that idyllic youth is replaced with the need to go out and earn a
living, whatever that is. So we choose a path, master some skills, and get a
job, taking our place in a society of worker-bees. We collect our paychecks,
and do our jobs all over again, day after endless day, with the goal of amass-
ing enough green stuff so we can enjoy our time off, buy things that make us
happy, have a cool place to live, and with luck, have enough left over so we
don’t starve in our old age.
Not only do you have to fund your lifestyle with the money you get from your
job(s), but you have to keep track of it all, make sure there’s enough to pay
the bills, and figure out how to finance the larger expenses in life. It may seem

Making Money at Your Job

like a daunting task, but trust me, the task is even more daunting if you leave it
to chance. Fortunately, you can follow the paper trail explained in this chapter
to keep track of all the money you earn from various sources, and then use the
nifty Quicken program, explained throughout the rest of this book, to keep up-
to-date financial information only a few clicks away.
Filling out the W-4 form
One of the first tasks you perform whenever you start a new job is the chore
of filling out the W-4 form, shown in Figure 1-1. W-4 is another name for
Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. You use this form to advise
your employer, and more particularly the person who writes the checks at
your place of employment, of useful details such as
✦The correct spelling of your name
✦Your real address
✦Your date of birth, so they can schedule the appropriate office party
(just kidding)
✦Your unique Social Security number, so that your paychecks made out to
Dolores Schnazeldorf won’t get mixed up with the checks for that other
Dolores Schnazeldorf down the hall
✦Your marital status, so people know whether to invite you to the singles
parties
✦The number of allowances you are claiming
✦Any extra amount above and beyond the regular tax amount that you
want your employer to send to Uncle Sam on your behalf
Back up to that one about the allowances because that’s the item that usu-
ally throws people for a loop. You can use one of four methods to decide
what number to put on this line:
✦Pick a number that sounds reasonable.
✦Calculate the number using the Personal Allowances Worksheet that
comes with the W-4 form.
✦If you don’t like the result you get on the Personal Allowances Worksheet,
you can use the Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet.
✦If all else fails and you’re not yet hopelessly confused, you can use the
Two-Earner/Two-Job Worksheet.
All of these worksheets come with the W-4 form, so you don’t have to go any-
where to find them. Here’s a summary of how each of these methods works.

Book I
Chapter 1

Choosing a reasonable number of allowances
If you’ve “been there, done that” for a few jobs already, this W-4 form is noth-
ing new to you, so just fill out the number of allowances you always claim,
and turn in your form so you can start collecting your paychecks.
Using the Personal Allowances Worksheet
The Personal Allowances Worksheet is an easy fill-in-the-blank worksheet
where you answer some simple questions about whether you have children
and a spouse, and which options you plan to choose on your tax return this
year. Based on your answers in this worksheet and your responses to a
quick Rorschach test, you find out if you get the corner office or a damp
room in the basement. All kidding aside, you add up the numbers on the
right side of this worksheet, and the total is the maximum number of
allowances you are supposed to claim on your W-4.
Keep in mind that this is a maximum number. You don’t have to claim all
those allowances. If you would rather have more tax withheld, you can go
with a smaller number of allowances. Some people like to get a fat refund
when they file their tax return in the spring, and, in the spirit of Fanny Price,
that’s not necessarily a bad thing. So if your worksheet tells you to claim six
allowances and you only want to claim three, claim three. The IRS will be
happy because they get more of your money to play with during the year.

Using the Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet
The Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet gives a different approach to
increasing the number of allowances you can claim on your W-4 form. This is
designed for
✦People who take advantage of the tax laws to itemize their deductions
✦People who reduce their income on their tax return with adjustments or
credits
✦People who actually know what everything I just said means
Math is required for this worksheet — you have to add, subtract, and divide
to figure out the form. And you’re supposed to enter information from the
Personal Allowances Worksheet, so go back and fill out that worksheet, and
then come back here.
Follow along in the Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet, noting these
key issues:
✦Step 1 may be a deal-breaker: You have to estimate how much your total
itemized deductions are going to be on the tax return you prepare next
spring. So, if you’re filling out the W-4 form in January 2006, you have to
guess what your itemized deductions will be on the tax return that you’re
going to prepare in April 2007. Go ahead; take a stab. Use an old tax return
and round the numbers up or down, depending on what seems right. You
only need a ballpark figure here.
✦Do some math, and then you get to step 4, where you have to estimate
the adjustments that will be on that tax return you file a year from now.
Adjustments include alimony you have to pay, deductible contributions
you make to an Individual Retirement Account (see Book VI for more on
this), deductible moving expenses (more on this in Book V), health
insurance costs, and one-half of your self-employment tax if you’re self-
employed, interest paid on student loans, and tuition and school fees
you may be deducting. The best way to estimate all of this is to repeat
what you reported for adjustments on last year’s tax return.
✦For step 6, you need to estimate any taxable income you expect to earn
this year that is not from your job. This includes the boring income like
dividends and interest, as well as the edgier sorts of income such as jury
duty fees, fees for sitting on some company’s board of directors, income
you earn (or amounts you lose) from second guessing (or not) the stock
market, income from illegal activities that you plan to report on your tax
return, and so on.
✦The rest is math. Do the calculations, and then take the final number and
use it for your W-4 allowances. Or not. If you and your spouse both have
jobs, or if you have another job, or if you’re just a glutton for punishment,
move on to the Two-Earner/Two-Job worksheet.

Using the Two-Earner/Two-Job Worksheet
You’ve made it this far, and you’re still trying to figure out what number of
allowances to put on that pesky W-4. You’re probably rethinking the whole
job idea at this point, but hang on — you’re nearly finished. Soon you’ll start
collecting paychecks and amassing great wealth.
Even greater math skills are required to fill out this worksheet because now
you get to subtract, divide, and multiply, and you get to compare numbers
and take the lowest, or the highest, depending on which way the wind is
blowing, and you’re no doubt thanking your parents for pushing you to take
those higher math courses in high school.
If you haven’t figured it out yet, the various worksheets that accompany the
W-4 form are designed to
(a) confuse the living daylights out of you
(b) persuade you to go to court and change your name to something other
than Dolores Schnazeldorf
and
(c) provide a rough estimate of how your tax withholding should be computed
in order to come pretty close to the actual amount of tax you will owe for the
year.
So do the best you can, and don’t fret if your calculation isn’t perfect. If
you’re worried about owing tax on your tax return, do the worksheets, and
then subtract 1 from your final number, just to have a little extra withheld
so you’ll be safe.
If you start getting paychecks and your personal situation changes in such
a way that your answers on those worksheets might be different, ask your
employer for another W-4 form and start all over again. You can change
your withholding at any time during the year.
Your paycheck
People just starting out in the workforce are always shocked when they
see their first paycheck. That large amount of money they were expecting
to receive from their job is depleted by income taxes, Social Security
taxes, Medicare taxes, “benefits” that the employee has to pay for, and 
more.

Making Money at Your Job
14
The pay stub that comes with your check breaks down all of the various
amounts that have been taken from your earnings. The key elements to
notice are as follows:
✦Gross pay (or Total Wages, or Salary, or some similar description —
usually the top line on your pay stub): This is the amount you earned
from all of your hard work. It’s nowhere near the amount you see on
your check, but this is what you started with before your employer
withheld money to pay for all the other stuff.
✦Federal income tax: This is the amount that goes to Uncle Sam.
✦Social Security (or FICA): This is the other amount that goes to Uncle Sam.
✦Medicare: This is yet another amount that goes to Uncle Sam.
✦State income tax: This is the amount that goes to Uncle Sam’s little helper.
✦Deductions: This area can include amounts for union dues, health
insurance, life insurance, contributions to a flex plan, or pretty much
anything else your employer offers that you are allowed to pay for from
your paycheck.
Usually your pay stub provides information about your current paycheck
and also year-to-date totals, so you can see at a glance how much you’ve
given to the government so far this year and how much you’ve been allowed
to keep.
Benefits you get at work
A job comes with all sorts of benefits. Not only do you get paid real money
(after taxes) to do what you love, but, depending on the type of job you
have, you may get a fancy uniform to wear, special tools to play with, built-in
friends to share coffee and gossip with every day, a free place to park, a big
truck to drive, free food, a cubicle to decorate with pictures of your pets, or
the occasional trip to faraway places like Des Moines or Pittsburgh to attend
free training.
Some benefits are called benefits even though you pay for them. This type of
benefit is often billed as a tax-free benefit, which means that you get to pay
for the benefit, but the amount you pay gets deducted from your gross pay
when it comes to figuring out how much income tax you owe.
Here are some important things to keep in mind regarding the tax-free bene-
fits you get at work:
✦The benefits recorded on your pay stub represent amounts paid for cer-
tain perks that are offered by your employer. Every employer offers dif-
ferent types of benefits (some employers don’t offer anything), so this
section of your pay stub varies from job to job.

Book I
Chapter 1
Earning Income
and Investing
Making Money at Your Job
15
✦You probably can’t take a deduction for the cost of the benefits on your
tax return. If you have a certain amount withheld from your paycheck
for health insurance, for example, chances are excellent that no tax is
being withheld on this amount. When you prepare your tax return next
year, you can’t deduct the amount you paid for health insurance because
the income you report on your tax return (see the section entitled “The
W-2 form” later in this chapter) has already been reduced by the amount
you paid for health insurance. In effect, you’ve already deducted the
health insurance, and deducting it on your tax return would amount to
deducting the health insurance twice.
✦On the other hand, some deductions from your pay are not taken out
before taxes and do indeed generate a tax deduction. Contributions to
organizations such as United Way are a good example of amounts that
appear on your pay stub that you can also deduct on your tax return.
Union dues are another.
✦The benefits you see on your pay stub may not appear on your W-2 form
at the end of the year. The pay stub may be the only place where you see
how much you’ve spent on the various goodies offered at work. So don’t
just toss the pay stub in the trash. Use this stub to record and keep track
of how much money you have paid for the various benefits. In particular,
hang on to the last stub of the year because it shows you the year-end
totals of all of your payments.
Bonus time
Some businesses pay bonuses to their employees in addition to the regular
pay. The IRS expects you to keep track of the bonus you receive and, of
course, share a little bit of it with the federal government.
To make this whole sharing process easier, many employers simply withhold
tax on the bonuses they give. It’s common for employers to withhold a flat
25 percent income tax from the bonus amount. Trust me, it’s kind of a let-down
to have the boss tell you your hard work was worth an extra $500 bonus but
here’s a check for only $375.
Some bonuses are small enough that the IRS is actually willing to let you
keep the entire bonus without sharing anything. These bonuses fall under
the general heading of, “Turkeys, Hams, and Other Items that are Difficult to
Tax.” The IRS rules specifically state that employees whose excellent service
to their employer resulted in a bonus of a turkey or ham or “other item of
small or nominal value” do not have to report the value of such gifts on their
tax returns, nor does the employer have to withhold a portion of the gift to
send to the government.
You’re relieved, I’m sure, to know that you don’t have to cut off one of the
turkey legs and package it up for delivery to the fine folks at the IRS. However,
if instead of a turkey or ham or other item that is difficult to tax, your boss

Making Money at Your Job
16
decides to give you cash, or worse yet, a gift certificate or some tickets to 
an athletic event that you might be able to easily convert to cash, it’s your
responsibility to report the value of such a gift on your tax return, “regardless
of the amount involved.”
The W-2 form
Each January, every employer you worked for in the previous year is
required to send you a W-2 form. The W-2, or Wage and Tax Statement, 
summarizes all of the money you earned from that job in the year that just
ended, along with all of the taxes you paid and sometimes other information.
Every job, no matter how minimal the pay, is a catalyst for a W-2 form at the
end of the year. Even if your entire job consisted of one midnight to 6 a.m.
shift as the night waitress at the Hour House Café, and your total wages for
the night were only $8.00 (not counting the $.36 in tips you received and not
taking into account the cost of the shoes you had to replace when a drunken
customer threw up on your feet), you still should expect a W-2 form from the
employer. If you move during the year, be sure to contact employers you
worked for earlier in the year, even if you never want to speak to them again
because they wouldn’t pay to replace your shoes, and let them know your
new address.
The W-2 form should include the same information that appeared on your
last pay stub for the year, so there shouldn’t be any surprises.
What to do if the dog eats your W-2 form
You can try your best to hang on to that W-2
form, but sometimes uncontrollable forces are
at work, like vacuum cleaners, overzealous
housekeepers, children who need to apply their
artistic skills, and yes, underfed or drooling dogs.
Fortunately, you can easily circumvent many of
life’s little mishaps, and in the case of W-2
forms, it’s a snap. First of all, if you’re only miss-
ing one copy of the W-2 form, just photocopy
one of the remaining pages. For example, if you
lose Copy B of the W-2, the page that’s sup-
posed to go with your federal tax return, photo-
copy Copy C or Copy 2, and attach that to your
tax return instead.
If all the copies of your W-2 form are lost or
destroyed, call the payroll department at your
place of employment and ask that they make
you a copy of the W-2 form. There’s no mag-
netic ink on these forms, nor does the color
matter, so a photocopy is an easy solution.
If all else fails, copy the income and withhold-
ing information from your last pay stub of the
year onto a piece of paper, include your name
and Social Security number, and attach that to
your tax return along with a statement saying
the original was lost or destroyed.

17
The information on your W-2 is used when you prepare your income tax
return. In fact, as you probably know if you’ve ever filed an income tax
return, the IRS asks that you attach the W-2 form to your tax return, so don’t
throw this form away when it comes in the mail.
You’re Self-Employed: You’ve Created Your Own Job!
Just because you don’t work as an employee for someone else, doesn’t
mean for a minute that you don’t have to keep track of your income and
the amounts you spend for your job. In fact, the record-keeping chore can
be rather overwhelming if your work entails getting income from lots of
places and buying lots of things for your job.
The advantages of working for yourself and basically creating your own job
can sometimes be overshadowed by the paperwork, the sporadic nature of
your income, and the sheer personal responsibility for making the job a suc-
cess. If you’ve got the bug to work for yourself, here are some points to keep
in mind when it comes to tracking your finances.
Getting paid
When you are self-employed, it’s up to you to stay on top of how much you
earn, where that money is coming from, and how quickly you receive your
payments. A record-keeping system is imperative so that you don’t lose
track of money owed to you. If your business involves customers who don’t
always pay in a timely fashion, you should develop some sort of collection
system so that you not only know who owes you and how late they are, but
so that you can successfully recover the money that’s owed to you.
You find out more about using Quicken to account for your business receiv-
ables in Book VIII. For now, here are some pointers for keeping track of and
collecting the money you’ve earned. (If your business is a cash business
where you get paid immediately, you can ignore this list.)
✦Use paper or electronic invoices to send to your customers, and keep
a copy of each invoice yourself.
✦Keep a list of your receivables, either on your computer or even on
paper. Don’t rely only on your memory. Record the receivables, along
with the date on which the invoices were issued, so none of them slip
by unnoticed.
✦Send monthly statements reminding your customers of unpaid amounts.
If you relax the rules and don’t send statements, even the best of cus-
tomers is likely to relax a little too much and send payments late, or not
at all.

You’re Self-Employed: You’ve Created Your Own Job!
18
✦Consider assessing finance charges for hard-to-collect amounts. If you
have customers who regularly pay late, the mere threat of a finance
charge may be just what it takes to get those customers on a better
schedule.
✦Be aggressive. It’s your money, so don’t be afraid to ask for it. You
wouldn’t expect to receive the goods or services you offer and not
pay for them promptly, and you have the right to receive the same
respect from your customers.
✦Have a serious collection plan in place. For those times when conven-
tional methods just don’t work, you should have a relationship with a
collection agency or an attorney to pull out the big guns and go after
customers who simply won’t pay.
Issuing 1099 forms
Because you are a responsible businessperson, you probably already know
the rules for issuing 1099 forms. But if you’re new to business, or if this is the
first time you made payments that require a 1099 form, you may not be on
top of the rules.
Here’s the breakdown of who needs to receive a 1099 form from you. Oh,
and by the way, don’t send a 1099 form whenever you hit the threshold for
required forms. Wait until the end of the year and send out your 1099 forms
all at once. The IRS requires that the 1099 forms be mailed by January 31 of
the year after the payments are made. See the “Sending 1099 forms to your
workers” sidebar for the complete rules for preparing and mailing 1099
forms.
✦1099-MISC: You are required to send a 1099-MISC to any person or part-
nership to whom your business paid $600 or more for service or for rent
(not for stuff you buy) during the entire year. Included in the definition
of person or partnership is any attorney, even if the attorney is incorpo-
rated. If you paid $599 or less, no form is necessary.
✦1099-INT: Send a 1099-INT to anyone to whom your business paid $10 or
more in interest during the year.
✦1099-DIV: If your business pays dividends, you must send a 1099-DIV to
anyone to whom you paid $10 or more in dividends during the year.
✦1096: Form 1096 is the cover sheet that needs to accompany all of your
various 1099 forms when you send them to the government.
Filing 1099 forms is serious business. You can be penalized up to $50 per
form for each form you neglect to file.

Book I
Chapter 1

and Investing
You’re Self-Employed: You’ve Created Your Own Job!
19
If your business sends out a lot of 1099 forms, you may already have a system
in place for processing these forms and may be doing so electronically. If you
only need to send out a few forms, poke around the Internet — you can find
some great online services that take care of all of this paperwork for a really
small fee.
Offsetting income with expenses
In addition to keeping track of how much money your business rakes in,
you’ve got to keep track of how much you spend. There are several reasons
why you might want to have this information.
✦Taxes: The more you spend on your business, the more you can write off
on your tax return, thus lowering the income on which your tax is calcu-
lated (and possibly encouraging a personal visit from the friendly auditors
at the IRS). There’s really nothing to worry about when it comes to IRS
examinations as long as you can (a) justify the expenses you deduct on
your tax return as legitimate business expenses, or (b) schedule a lengthy
trip out of the country when it’s time for your examination. When you
start taking deductions for dog food, toys for the kids, and that business
(wink, wink) trip to see your old high school buddies at a posh resort, the
IRS inevitably starts taking a closer look at your expense deductions.
Sending 1099 forms to your workers
If you have a service take care of preparing and
sending your 1099 forms, you’ve succeeded in
avoiding a major headache each January. If
you prepare and send the 1099 forms yourself,
follow these steps in order to avoid raising the
ire of the IRS.
1. Acquire blank 1099 forms.
If you don’t have any blank forms, contact
the IRS at 1-800-TAX-FORM (give them
about two weeks’ notice) and ask for the
blanks, or visit your local IRS office and
pick up the forms yourself. Be sure to get a
1096 form while you’re at it.
Although most IRS forms can be down-
loaded from www.irs.gov, forms 1096
and 1099 are exceptions. You must submit
scanable versions of these documents, so
be sure to get these forms directly from the
IRS or from an office supply store; other-
wise, you might be fined by the IRS.
2. Prepare the 1099 forms and the 1096 sum-
mary form.
3. Mail the recipient copies of the 1099 forms
to the people whose names appear on the
forms by January 31 of the year after the
payments were made.
4. Send the 1096 and the government copies of
the 1099 forms to the IRS by February 28th.
(This deadline is March 31st if you’re filing
the forms electronically.)

You’re Self-Employed: You’ve Created Your Own Job!

✦Knowledge: When you’re operating a business, no matter what kind of
business it is, you need to know how much money you have. Keeping
track of what you earn is one part of the picture. Keeping track of what
you spend is another. If you don’t monitor your spending (see Book I,
Chapter 3 on budgeting for more on how to monitor your spending) and
just hope there’s money in the bank every morning, you’ll probably learn
soon enough that you have a lot more to worry about than whether or not
the IRS is going to disallow your dog food deductions.
✦Investors and lenders: At some point, you may want to expand your
empire and bring some outside investors into the mix. In order to
encourage people to invest in or loan money to your business, you need
to show them how well your business is doing, and this means you need
to provide detailed and accurate reports (see Book VII for more on
reports) of how much you make and how much you spend.
✦Future planning: Crystal balls may not really exist, but you can get a
pretty good prediction of how your business is going to do in the future
by looking at how much you earned and how much you spent in the past.
To keep track of your expenses, you should keep a paper trail of what you
spent by writing checks or using a charge card instead of paying cash. You’ll
get bank statements and charge card statements each month itemizing all of
your transactions, and then you can have the fun of reconciling those state-
ments to make sure everything was recorded properly.
Fortunately, the days of bank statement reconciliation headaches are a thing
of the past thanks to the wonders of Quicken. You’ll see in Book II that recon-
ciling bank and credit card statements can actually be fun!
Estimating taxes
Somewhere between the days when you are an employee and the days when
you are so wealthy that you can hire someone else to take care of paying
your taxes for you, you’re going to have to pay your own taxes on your self-
employment income. Employees have it easy because their bosses pay the
taxes for them. When you’re self-employed, you not only have the chore of
making the tax payments yourself, but you also get to pay way more tax than
employees do thanks to the wonders of our federal stealth tax system.
If you’re an employee, you have the regular tax withholdings of federal
income tax, Social Security tax, Medicare tax, state income tax, and maybe
city income tax too. You may be lucky enough to live in a state or city where
there is no income tax, in which case you either pay a higher sales and prop-
erty tax than the rest of the country, or you have a lot of holes in your roads.
The upside of being an employee, from a tax point of view, is that you get to
work for an employer who matches your Social Security and Medicare tax
payments with equal amounts out of his own pocket.

Book I
Chapter 1
Earning Income
and Investing
You’re Self-Employed: You’ve Created Your Own Job!
21
Self-employed people don’t have those employers hanging around to pick up
the slack, so they have to pay double the Social Security and Medicare taxes
themselves. These Social Security and Medicare taxes, which are called self-
employment taxes when you’re self-employed, get combined with your federal
income tax and paid to the government in the form of estimated taxes.
You should pay one-fourth of your estimated tax for the year with each pay-
ment. The estimated taxes for self-employed individuals are supposed to be
paid quarterly, based on following schedule:
✦First quarter payment: Due April 15
✦Second quarter payment: Due June 15
✦Third quarter payment: Due September 15
✦Fourth quarter payment: Due January 15 after the year ends
For our purposes, due means postmarked by, and if the 15th falls on a Saturday
or Sunday or federal holiday, you get until the next business day to get the
postmark.
Note that the rules for making estimated payments are different for corpora-
tions. The January payment is due on December 15th.
Consider making monthly payments. The IRS won’t object if you want to
make your payments early. Sometimes it’s easier to budget tax payments if
you pay 1⁄12th of your estimated tax each month instead of paying 1⁄4th of the
tax four times a year.
The amount you’re supposed to pay for estimated taxes is calculated with
one of the following formulas:
✦Your estimated payments should add up to at least 90 percent of your
current year’s income tax, or
✦Your estimated payments should add up to at least 100 percent of your
previous year’s income tax, keeping in mind that,
✦If your taxable income is more than $150,000 ($75,000 if you’re single or
married filing separately), your estimated payments should add up to at
least 110 percent of your previous year’s income tax.
It probably goes without saying that it’s easier to calculate what your esti-
mated tax should be if you keep track of your income and expenses during
the year. By keeping good records, you are also prepared for any tax you
owe in the spring and won’t have any nasty surprises that involve having
to go into hock to pay your tax bill.

Keeping Track of Earnings from Your Investments
22
Keeping Track of Earnings from Your Investments
When you think of investments, you probably think of things like bank savings
accounts, money market funds, brokerage accounts, shares of stock, savings
bonds, retirement funds, Swiss bank accounts, that stash of cash hidden in
your parents’ freezer, and so on. These are all called cash investments because
the only thing you can do with them is turn them into cash (or in the case of
Enron stock certificates, make a nice campfire). Other types of investments
include stamp and coin collections, artwork, antiques, jewelry, rare books,
classic cars, vintage Mr. Potato Head kits, and just about any kind of tangible
object you might own that is worth more today than what you paid for it.
It’s important to know how much money you are making off of your invest-
ments, or by how much your investments are increasing in value, so you can
make decisions about whether you want to keep your money tied up in
those investments or change your investing strategy.
Besides knowing how much your investments earn, it’s useful to know how
much your investments are worth. Although the financial institution holding
the money usually insures cash investments, the insurance on tangible
objects is your responsibility. Make a list of all of your valuable stuff and
how much it’s worth, and then pay a visit to your insurance agent. Find out
what is covered by your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance and decide what
other type of insurance coverage you might need.
For cash investments, the banks, stockbrokers, and other companies that
process and hold your investments send you regular statements showing
how your investments are doing. Be sure to hang on to these statements —
especially the one you get at the end of the year — so you’ll have a record 
of your progress. If your cash investments aren’t making particularly stellar
progress, at least you can use the statements for packaging material around
your precious (and much more valuable) collection of Monkees memorabilia.
In addition to statements, each of these organizations will send a 1099 form
to you in January showing your earnings for the previous year. The informa-
tion on your 1099 forms must be included on your tax return.
The IRS gets a copy of your 1099 forms, and they check to make sure there
are like amounts on your tax return, so no cheating!
You don’t have to attach the 1099 forms to your tax return — they are for
your records. The exception to this rule is that if there is a record of taxes
withheld on your 1099 form, you should attach the form to your tax return.
Earning interest on your savings account
Money deposited in a savings account earns interest, which increases the
amount of money in the account. The bank gives the depositor interest in

Book I
Chapter 1

and Investing
Keeping Track of Earnings from Your Investments
23
exchange for the letting the bank have the use of the money. The bank can
lend out the money at a higher rate of interest, and thus make a profit on the
use of your savings money. Meanwhile, you are required to pay tax on the
interest that the bank gives you.
At the end of the year, your bank statement reflects the amount of interest
you earned for the entire year and that amount is also reported to the IRS.
(Unless of course you earned less than $10 for the year, in which case the IRS
doesn’t get a statement, but you’re still supposed to abide by the honor
system and report the earnings on your tax return.)
If you use a paper passbook and record your interest the old-fashioned way,
by writing down the amount of interest every month when your bank state-
ment comes, or if you’re more modern and use Quicken to automatically
record the interest each month, you already know how much interest you
earned and won’t have to wait for the bank to summarize the interest for you.
If you bank online at your bank’s Web site, or if you use Quicken’s funds
transfer features, you can move money into your savings account right from
your computer. Saving money doesn’t get any easier than that.
Money markets and mutual funds
One of the best ways to get involved in investing is through money markets
and mutual funds. These investment vehicles are conduits whereby a group
of investors pools their available money and the fund invests all of the
money together on behalf of the participants.
Savings, 1950s-style
Back in Leave It To Beaver-land where I grew
up, we had a program at my school called Bank
Day. On Bank Day, all of us kids would bring the
spare change we had collected by mowing
lawns (standard rate, 50¢) and taking pop bottles
to the corner store for the deposit refund (2¢ per
bottle), and we’d give the money to our teacher,
who would record our deposit in our savings
account passbooks. Somebody from the school
would take the money from all the classes to the
bank. These nickel and dime deposits would
earn a little bit of interest, and in exchange, we
learned a little bit about saving.
Meanwhile, our parents belonged to Christmas
Clubs at their jobs where they turned in a fixed
amount each week. They’d get the money back
early in December, plus interest, and that was
what they were supposed to spend on pres-
ents. It was an easy way of saving so that holi-
day spending didn’t break the budget.
You don’t hear much about those programs
anymore, and it’s kind of a shame. In the 1950s,
saving money was a way of life, just another
part of going to school or work.

You don’t have to know a lot about investing to choose an investment fund,
and your risk is minimized because the fund can buy a wide variety of invest-
ments instead of putting all of its investment eggs in just one basket.
I’ve lumped money markets and mutual funds together in this section
because the record-keeping for both types of investments is similar.
However, there are distinct differences between money market investments
and mutual funds.
Money market accounts and money market funds
A money market account, also known as a money market deposit account, 
is an interest-bearing account offered by a financial institution (otherwise
known as your friendly neighborhood bank, credit union, or savings and
loan). Much like a savings account but with a higher minimum balance, the
money market account is insured by the FDIC. Money market accounts pay
interest, typically at a rate higher than a savings account.
If you’ve got plenty of money to invest, you need to know this important info
about the FDIC. FDIC insurance only covers the first $100,000 in a covered
account, so investments that exceed $100,000 should be spread among mul-
tiple institutions to benefit from the FDIC protection.
The banks and other institutions that offer money market accounts limit the
number of transactions you can have in the account each month, so you can’t
use the money market account like an interest-bearing checking account,
paying all of your bills from the account while you earn the nice interest rate.
You don’t own shares in a money market account — you just put in a certain
amount of money and watch it grow. Typically the interest rate on a money
market account is stated up front and is non-fluctuating.
You need to keep track of the interest you receive on your money market
account because the interest is taxable and must be reported on your
income tax returns.
A money market mutual fund is sold in shares, with each share costing $1, and
usually you must buy a minimum number of shares on your initial investment.
The fund purchases short-term debt instruments, such as treasury bills and
other government securities, as well as corporate money market securities,
and typically the money market investments mature in 13 months or less.
Money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC, but don’t let that
be a deterrent. This is one of the safest investments around.
The interest rate on a money market mutual fund changes depending on the
fund’s investments, so no interest rate is stated up front.

Money market mutual funds often work like checking accounts in that you
can have check-writing privileges and then you have the added joy of recon-
ciling your account each month. But never fear. Reconciliation isn’t a dirty
word when you use Quicken.
Mutual funds
Mutual funds make the stock market and other types of investing accessible
to nearly anyone. One mutual fund might invest in hundreds of stocks or
bonds, and with your investment, you own a little piece of each of the fund’s
holdings. By joining a mutual fund, you don’t have to have buckets of money
to invest in blue chip stocks, international currency, government bonds, or
whatever other type of investment interests you.
The advantage to investing in a mutual fund over investing directly in the
stock market is that you get the chance to spread your money over a great
variety of investments, thus presumably minimizing your risk. And for a very
low fee (which is typically taken out of your earnings, so you don’t actually
see the cost of participation in the fund), you get to benefit from the expert-
ise of the fund manager, who, with luck, won’t take your money and run
away to a private island in the Caribbean.
There is a slim chance that your mutual fund manager actually will take a
hike with a bundle of cash from the fund, or, a more likely scenario is that
a fund that looked good when you bought into it doesn’t do too well and
loses money. For these reasons, it’s always prudent to spread your investible
cash over a variety of investment options.
For a small initial investment, you can open a mutual fund account and con-
tinue making regular investments. Over time, if the fund is successful, your
investments will continue to increase in value. Many mutual funds require an
opening investment of $500 or $1,000 (some high roller funds require much
more), but some funds let you open up an account for as little as $50 if you
agree to a monthly automatic withdrawal from your bank account for contin-
ued investment.
Rumor has it that even though some funds publicize their opening invest-
ment at $1,000 or $2,000, if you call them on the phone and plead your case,
you can negotiate a lower initial deposit. The negotiation probably goes
more smoothly if you agree to a monthly investment schedule.
Unlike with stock investments, where it’s probably more common to take
your dividend earnings in checks (see “Playing the stock market” below),
most mutual fund participants leave their earnings in the fund to grow and
to be reinvested. So instead of receiving little checks in the mail each time a
dividend is declared by one of the stocks owned by the mutual fund, your
share of the dividend is added to the value of the fund and the value of your
investment in the fund increases.

Keeping Track of Earnings from Your Investments
26
Usually, mutual funds send monthly statements showing how much your
shares earned in the last month, how much you invested in the fund (or
withdrew from the fund), and how many new shares you now own due to
your investment or your reinvested earnings.
Hang on to all of your mutual fund statements. You may want to be able to
recall all of your investment and reinvestment activity when you take money
out of the fund. Taking cash out of a mutual fund has the same effect as sell-
ing individual shares of stock, only in this case, you are selling shares of
your mutual fund. See Book V for more information on how to report the
redemption of mutual fund shares on your tax return.
Playing the stock market
Companies sell stocks, or ownership shares, to raise money for their busi-
ness. The shareholders of a company actually own the business and have an
opportunity to vote on certain business decisions.
If you want to buy stock, you can’t just go up and knock on the front door of
General Motors and ask to purchase a share of stock. You need to use the
services of a stockbroker who makes the purchase for you. You can work with
a brokerage company and deal with a real person who helps you make invest-
ment decisions, or you can use the Internet to acquire the services of a stock
trading service, and make your own trading decisions right at your computer.
When you buy and sell stocks, the most important thing to remember, at least
from a record-keeping standpoint, is to keep track of the dates on which you
make purchases and sales and the amounts you spent and collected. You are
expected to be able to reproduce this information on your tax return.
The purchase information for stocks is also important if you give the stock
away, either to another person or as a contribution to an organization.
So find a safe place to keep your stock purchase information because you
might have to hold on to this information for many years. In the good old
days, everyone had a safe deposit box at the bank, and that is where they
kept the deeds to their houses, savings bonds, and stock certificates.
Anymore, many people do their banking online or over the phone and pur-
chase stocks through an Internet service such as e-Trade or Ameritrade, so
the regular trip to the bank to sequester important documents in a safe
deposit box seems to be less of a tradition.

Investing For Dummies by Paul Mladjenovic (Wiley).

Bonds and treasury bills
A bond is another word for a loan — by purchasing a bond, you in effect 
loan money to the company or government entity from which you make the
purchase. A bond has a fixed life expectancy and when you make the pur-
chase, you expect to have your money returned to you when the term of the
bond ends.
Typically, bonds pay interest over the course of the bond’s term. Then, when
the bond obligation is fulfilled, the bond is retired and you receive your orig-
inal investment back.
Bonds are rated based on how likely it is you will actually get your money
back. The higher the rating, the safer the risk. Likewise, the lower the rating,
the riskier the bond. The riskier bonds are usually offered at a higher inter-
est rate, in order to attract investors who are willing to gamble and take the
higher risk.
You can purchase bonds in one of several ways:
✦Buy bonds at banks. U.S. government savings bonds are available at
your bank in increments as small as $25. These bonds are sold at 50 per-
cent of face value, so $25 gets you a $50 savings bond. When the bond
matures, you get $50. If you purchase series EE or series I savings bonds
and redeem them to pay for higher education costs, there is no tax on
the difference on the bond’s interest.
✦Buy U.S. Treasury bonds and savings bonds online at the Treasury
Department’s Web site, www.treasurydirect.gov.
✦Buy bonds from a broker.
✦Some employers offer a payroll withdrawal program that allows you to
purchase bonds at work.
✦Buy bonds by buying shares in a mutual fund that specializes in bonds.
Treasury bills, like government savings bonds, are purchased at a discount.
Instead of receiving payments of interest over the course of the bill’s life, the
bill itself increases in value until it reaches its stated value. At that time,
the bill is redeemed and you receive the full face amount of the Treasury bill.
The interest you receive on bonds and treasury bills is taxable, so it’s impor-
tant to keep track of your earnings throughout the year. Some bond interest
is taxable on both your federal and state income tax returns, other interest is
taxed only on your federal return, and still other interest is only taxable on
your state return. Here are the general rules:
✦Interest on U.S. savings bonds and other federal government invest-
ments is taxable on your federal income tax return but not on state 
and local income tax returns.

Keeping Track of Earnings from Your Investments
28
✦Interest on corporate bonds is taxable on all of your income tax returns.
✦Interest on municipal bonds is tax exempt on your federal income tax
return, but may be taxable on your state tax return. If the bond was
issued by a municipality or tax exempt organization (such as a school)
in your own state, the bond interest is probably not taxable on your
state tax return. Check the instructions that accompany your state tax
return for more information about municipal bond interest.
Earnings in retirement funds
You’ve got plenty stashed away for your nest egg, right? Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, 402(c)s, 609(y)s, whatever.
And of course there’s that Rumplestiltskin pile of gold called Social Security
waiting for all of us. Just knowing you have all this money waiting for you in
your waning years should be security enough. But actually knowing how
much you can expect to have when you’re ready to retire and how much
your long-term investments are earning would be pure heavenly bliss, or at
least common-sense satisfaction.
Keeping track of earnings in your retirement funds can be a sticky area. 
Not only is it possible that you own several funds, but the possibility also
exists that some of your retirement fund money is tax-free, some of it is tax-
deferred, and some of it will be fully taxable. All of those tax rules affect how
much money will actually be yours to keep.
It’s imperative that you keep track of all of your retirement money, know
where it is invested, know how it will be taxed, and maintain some control
over the investments, so that you don’t jeopardize your financial future.
You’ll find Book VI on retirement planning to be quite useful in figuring out
how you can take advantage of all that Quicken has to offer for helping you
stay on top of your retirement investments.
For now, here are some basic descriptions of the various types of retirement
funds that may be available to you.
401(k), 403(b) tax-deferred retirement plans
Many employers offer 401(k) plans to their employees. A 401(k) is a long-
term savings plan funded by automatic withholdings from your paycheck
and often enhanced with matching funds provided by your employer.
If you work for a school or church or government, you may have a 403(b)
instead of a 401(k), but the idea is basically the same. These plans are tax-
deferred, meaning you can fund them with money on which you pay no
income tax, and the earnings in the plans grow, untaxed, until you’re ready
to take the money out.

Book I
Chapter 1
Earning Income
and Investing
Keeping Track of Earnings from Your Investments
29
When it’s time to get your hands on the money in a tax-deferred retirement
plan, usually when you turn age 591⁄2 (the minimum age for penalty-free with-
drawals), or a bit older if you decide to wait awhile, the amounts you take
out of the plan are taxed at your current rate of income tax.
Try not to take the money out of a tax-deferred plan before the plan says you
can do so without a penalty. The penalty for taking money out early is 10 per-
cent of the amount you withdraw. This is on top of the income tax you pay.
Typically, participants in a 401(k) or similar plan have a variety of options
from which to choose for investing their plan money. The options will be a
choice of mutual funds, some riskier than others. You can split your invest-
ment if you like so that some of the money goes in safe funds and some in
the riskier but potentially higher earning funds.
Monitor your 401(k) money closely and consider changing your mix of
investments to take advantage changes in the stock market. Also, as you get
closer to your own retirement, you’ll want to think about moving your 401(k)
money into more conservative investments that may not earn as much but
are less risky.
Traditional Individual Retirement Accounts
The traditional IRA (“traditional” is used to differentiate from the IRA’s baby
brother, the Roth IRA) is a tax-deferred retirement account you can open
yourself. Contributions to the IRA of up to $4,000 per year may be tax-
deductible if you meet certain picky requirements (see Table 1-1).
The annual IRA contribution limit of $4,000 is good for the years 2005-2007.
In 2008 the amount is scheduled to increase to $5,000. Starting in 2009, the
amount is scheduled to increase each year based on an annual inflation
adjustment. Table 1-1 applies to taxpayers who are covered by a retirement
plan at their job.

If you’re 50 years old or older, you can contribute another $500 each year to
your IRA ($1,000 starting in 2006), also deductible if you fit the descriptions
above.
No matter what your age or filing status or income level or whether you prefer
Original Recipe or Extra Crispy, you can contribute the maximum amount to
an IRA each year and not take a deduction. So don’t use the restrictions from
the tables above as an excuse to not sock any money away for retirement. You
won’t get to take a deduction for your contribution, but the earnings in the
account will continue to grow, tax-deferred, until you are ready to retire.
When you retire, you can take the money out of your IRA based on convo-
luted schedules provided by the IRS that may make the hairs on the back of
your neck stand up because they tell you when you’re expected to die. Any
amounts you withdraw from the IRA are taxed at the time you take the
money. The exception to that rule is that if you contributed money to the
account but did not take a deduction for your contribution, you’ve already
paid the tax on that amount so you don’t have to pay tax again. 
Roth Individual Retirement Accounts
Former U.S. Senator William Roth invented the Roth IRA, a hybrid IRA that
encourages people to contribute to savings without the benefit of a current
tax deduction for their contribution. The pie in the sky with the Roth IRA is
that you never pay tax on the money you take out of the account.

Book I
Chapter 1

and Investing

So if you invest successfully and your Roth IRA contributions grow astro-
nomically, you can take the money and spend it on yourself, guilt-free, not
ever having to share a dime with the IRS.
Setting up a Roth IRA is not quite as easy as it may sound. As with anything
touched by the IRS, there are restrictions and hoops to jump through.
Table 1-3 shows who gets to contribute to a Roth IRA.

*If you don’t live with your spouse at all during the year, you should use the guidelines for Single.
You should note that with both types of IRA, the amount of your annual con-
tribution is limited to lower of the maximum contribution amount or the
amount you earn from a job. So if you only made $1,500 at your job during
the year, the most you can contribute to an IRA is $1,500, no matter how
much more the tables may suggest you can contribute.
If you don’t make any money at a job but you are married to someone who
does, the spousal IRA rules kick in, and you can “borrow” earned income
from your spouse to qualify for your own IRA contribution.

magine a life without spending money. You could earn and earn and earn,
and never spend a dime. Just think how wealthy you would be! Just think
how hungry you would be! Just think how bored you would be! We spend
money to keep ourselves fed and housed and to ensure our comfort and to
fill our lives with the material possessions and intangible items that give us
pleasure. The trick to spending well is to not spend more than you make,
pay your bills on time, and still have some money left over. This chapter
is about spending, keeping track of your spending, and how that spending
affects your economic life.
Spending Money on Required Expenses
The really boring part of spending involves spending money for things that
you have to buy, like rent and milk. A lot of areas of spending are simply
considered requirements of your chosen lifestyle.
Alternatively, the fun choices you make for spending beyond the require-
ments are personal and differ from one person to the next. Whether you
choose to spend your extra money for vacations, books, tickets to sports
events, or fancy hats, it’s your choice and it’s your extra money.
But this chapter is concerned with the necessities: the expenses that you
probably pay first, before the fun stuff. Keeping track of those expenses and
making sure you have the money to pay them may not be entertaining, but it
beats the alternative of not having enough money when the bills come due.
Necessary expenses include the Big Three (food, shelter, and clothing), as
well as other important spending like electricity and water, doctor bills, car
expenses, and stuff for your kids and pets.

Spending Money on Required Expenses
34
The Big Three: food, shelter, and clothing
Known as the basic necessities of life, or, the expenses that seem to cost way
more than they ought to, are taxes, gas for the car, and health insurance. Or
at least that’s the way it seems.
Seriously, the traditional big three expenses, the things we can’t live without,
are food, shelter, and clothing. And although we each define these items dif-
ferently, they are a completely necessary part of our ongoing expenses. At
first glance it might seem like these expenses cannot be changed. But upon
closer examination, you may find many ways that you can cut costs, if that’s
your desire, even with these necessities.
Keeping records of your spending is the first step to being able to analyze
your costs and, perhaps, alter your spending habits so that you have more
for the fun things you want to do.
You are what you eat
There are a variety of reasons for keeping track of your spending on food
items. Your food costs are manageable and can be controlled to a certain
extent. For example, when you add up all of your family’s food costs, includ-
ing groceries, school lunches for the kids, restaurant lunches for the workers
in your family, dinners eaten out or carry-outs, midnight taco runs, fancy cof-
fees and teas, and between-meal snacks, the amounts can be staggering. If
you’re trying to cut costs, try these tips for saving on food:
✦Limit your restaurant spending to a fixed amount each month, and keep
track of your spending. When you reach your limit, stop going out and
stick to food prepared at home.
✦Pack lunches for school and work. Make a little more for dinner in the
evening and use the leftovers for lunches.
✦Choose your favorite type of restaurant and invest in a cookbook that
features that type of food. Learn how to make your favorite dishes at
home.
✦Use coupons. Wait for double or triple coupon days at your local grocery,
then stock up on the essentials at great savings.
✦Shop at a cooperative or wholesale club. If the 20-pound bag of potatoes
is too much for your family to consume, shop with a friend and split the
items you buy and the cost.
Save your receipts and keep track of your food expenses (Quicken is great
for this!) to see how much you save when you implement some of these
ideas.

Your home is your castle
Although your housing expenses may seem fixed, as in a monthly rent or
mortgage payment, there are ways you can take control of this necessary
expense.
✦Make extra mortgage payments. Book IV on household finances explains
in detail how paying even just a little extra in principal or altering the
timing of your mortgage payments can have a significant impact on the
total amount you owe for your home. In the short run, you’re paying
more, but in the long run, you save bundles.
✦Ask your landlord if you can do your own repairs and improvements in
exchange for a reduction in your rent payment.
✦Refinance your mortgage. Often people refinance their mortgage with
the intention of taking equity out of the house. The result is sometimes 
a new mortgage payment that’s even higher than the old payment.
Consider refinancing without increasing your equity, just decreasing
your interest rate. Your monthly payments will decrease too.
✦Consider moving to a less expensive home.
✦Share living expenses. If the cost of your home has simply gotten out of
control, consider living with a friend or other family member and split
the costs.
If you own your home and you don’t have a copy of your mortgage interest
schedule, otherwise known as a loan amortization schedule, ask your lender.
This schedule shows you how much of each payment goes toward interest,
how much goes toward the actual cost of your home, and how much is allo-
cated to insurance and taxes. Knowing how much of your payment goes to
interest and other expenses will help in any decision you make to refinance
or relocate.
The clothes on your back
You might enjoy wearing the latest fashions or trying out a new wardrobe
every season. Or you might be the type who mends old clothes until they’re
threadbare, saving ancient items for sentimental reasons, and only buying
new clothes when it’s an absolute necessity.
Either way, or some way in between, clothes are a requirement in our society,
and the expense can be one to reckon with.
Parents know all about replacing wardrobes every time a child grows an
inch. And, alas, children aren’t the only ones who change size from time to
time. Just take one look at all the diet books in the bookstore and you’ll
know what I mean.

Spending Money on Required Expenses
36
Keep track of how much you spend on clothes so that you won’t be surprised
when it’s time to make those purchases. It’s easy to remember a housing
expense because you pay it every month. And food is a constant cost
because, well, we eat every day. But clothes can sneak up on you, and they
aren’t cheap.
The best way to keep track of your clothing expenses is to do a little research.
Go back through your checking account and charge card records (this will be
a simple process once you get comfortable with Quicken) and summarize a
year or two of clothing purchases. See how much you’ve spent on clothes for
yourself and your family members, and use this as a guide for what you can
expect to spend in the year ahead.
And while you’re contemplating your clothing costs, here are a few tips for
saving money in this department:
✦Look for sales. Most department stores have frequent sales, clearing the
racks of last month’s fashions to make room for the newer items.
✦Shop off-season. Plan ahead and buy your heavy clothes in the spring
when the summer clothes are selling at full price, and look for light-
weight items in the winter when everything is faux-fur and wool. You’ll
find that prices are slashed on the off-season clothes, and nearly every
store has a bargain rack where these items can be found.
✦Go re-saling. The resale shops have great bargains on gently worn items.
If you don’t mind secondhand, you’ll be pleasantly surprised at the money
you can save.
Spending money on utilities
When I was small, the only thing I associated with the word utilities was the
pair of unpopular properties on the Monopoly board, the electric company
and water works. I didn’t know much about what those descriptions meant;
I just knew that landing on them meant I had to pay a small fee and then I
could be on my way.
Real utilities carry the same kind of baggage. They’re kind of a nuisance, but
unavoidable, and must be paid before you can go on about your business.
Take electricity, for example. You can’t say it isn’t worth a smidgen of your
paycheck each month to be able to have lights come on when you clap your
hands. And don’t overlook the importance of paying for water. The benefit of
not having to walk a mile to the well every time we want a drink is worth way
more than the small fee we send to the water company each month. And don’t
forget the alternative of having to take baths outdoors like the Romans did.
It might make for some interesting socializing, but what did those Romans
do about bathing outside in January?

Book I
Chapter 2

Spending Money on Required Expenses
37
Keeping track of your utilities expenses can provide some useful insights.
For one thing, if you own a home and ever hope to sell it to someone else,
you’ll probably be asked to tell how much the utilities cost. Same goes for
subletting an apartment.
You’ll also find it an interesting exercise to monitor your utilities, making
small changes in your lifestyle like turning down the heat while you’re hud-
dled under covers at night, or fixing that leaky faucet in the basement. Make
a change and watch your utilities expenses for six months, or compare the
expenses to the same time period last year, and see if there isn’t a difference.
You’ll be able to collect this information easily with Quicken when you start
recording your expenses and producing analysis reports.
And if you’re interested in cutting those utility expenses, here are a few tips:
✦Turn off lights when you vacate a room.
✦Don’t leave water running when you’re not using it.
✦Have your furnace and ducts cleaned regularly, and replace filters
according to the schedule recommended by the manufacturer.
✦Take shorter showers (or share a shower with someone you love!).
✦Turn off electrical appliances, such as television, stereo, and computer,
when they’re not in use.
✦Enjoy the fresh air and turn off the air conditioner in the summer — 
ceiling and attic fans are excellent alternatives.
✦Switch to florescent light bulbs.
✦Check your home for drafts and then have them repaired.
Try some of these suggestions and see if they make a difference in your
expenses.
The doctor is in
Sooner or later, everybody needs to spend some money on medical care.
If you’re the type who goes in for annual checkups, keeps up-to-date with
health insurance, and rarely gets sick, your medical expenses are of the
more ongoing type. If you ignore the checkups and little signs and wait for
the big illnesses, or if you’re just prone to getting sick or having accidents,
you might be a person who regularly fights with big medical bills. Even if
your medical experiences fall somewhere in between, you probably always
have an omnipresent concern that medical costs are lurking just over the
horizon.

Spending Money on Required Expenses
38
Many types of expenses are lumped into the area of medical expenses. For
example:
✦The normal stuff that comes to mind when you think of being sick, like
doctors, dentists, nurses, hospitals, medicine, and ambulance
✦Health insurance and amounts for health care that gets paid into flex
plans
✦Preventative costs such as vitamins, health club memberships, exercise
classes, treadmills, weights, exercise mats, stretchy exercise outfits, and
bicycles
✦Elective medical care, including plastic surgery, liposuction, stomach
stapling, and teeth bleaching
✦Medical equipment and devices, like glasses, contact lenses, hearing
aids, crutches, splints, walkers, wheelchairs, bars in the bathroom,
ramps, canes, and so on
Try keeping a handle on medical expenses by knowing the provisions of
your health insurance inside and out, lumping elective medical expenses in
the same year so that you have an opportunity to take a tax deduction, and
not letting money in a company flex plan go unused.
Your taxes and medical expenses
The IRS allows taxpayers who itemize their deductions the opportunity to
take a deduction for medical expenses. Sort of. You can deduct any medical
expenses (except for non-prescription medicine and the expenses like health
club dues, bicycles, aerobics and yoga classes, and the tight outfits that go
with those activities), as long as the expenses you deduct exceed 7.5 percent
of the adjusted gross income on your tax return.
In layman’s terms, this means that if you earned $50,000 last year at your
job, and you paid $3,800 in deductible medical expenses during the year, you
can take an itemized deduction for a whopping $50 ($50,000 x 7.5% = $3,750;
$3,800 – $3,750 = $50). You may think this doesn’t seem like much of a return
for all of the out-of-pocket money you spent on doctors and crutches, and
you’d be right.
If you plan on indulging in some elective medical expenses, like tummy tuck-
ing or face lifting or teeth straightening, try lumping all of the expenses in
one year. For example, you can probably prepay your doctor for orthodontic
work that will span a couple of years. Keep in mind that if you charge the
expenses for purposes of calculating a tax deduction, you get to choose
whether to include the medical expenses with the year of the charge or the
year in which you pay off the charge.

Use-it-or-lose-it flex plans
The flex plan is one of life’s little ironies. As an alternative to simply writing
a check to pay for your doctor bills that aren’t covered by health insurance,
the IRS allows employers to entice employees to contribute to a company
flex plan for medical expenses.
With a flex plan, you have a predetermined amount of money withdrawn from
your paycheck each pay period. The employer hangs on to this money for
safe-keeping. Then when you get sick, you either pay the doctor or hospital or
buy medicine and ask your employer to pay you back out of your own money
in the flex plan, or you hand the bill to your employer and ask him to pay it
out of your own money in the flex plan.
Money you put into a flex plan is contributed on a pre-tax basis, meaning you
don’t have to pay income tax on the money. The catch is that if you don’t use
all the money in your flex account to pay for medical expenses by the end of
the year, you can’t have the money back. It’s lost to you, and the employer
gets to keep it.
The moral of this story is that you must keep excellent records of your
spending. Pay careful attention to how much money is in the flex plan and
how you plan to utilize the money. As the end of the year approaches, make
sure you have receipts for all of your out-of-pocket medical expenses, includ-
ing prescriptions and any other medical costs that are allowed by the flex
plan, so you can get your money back.
If it looks like you’re about to lose some of your flex plan money, go on a
medical spending spree. If you wear contact lenses, buy some extra pairs, or
get in to see the doctor for your annual checkup, refill all of your prescrip-
tions, get your teeth cleaned, or whatever it takes. There’s no point in giving
the money away, even if you really like your employer.
If you had to hustle to use up your flex plan dollars at the end of the year,
reconsider your level of participation in the flex plan program for next year.
Reduce your contribution or make sure you plan to have enough medical
expenses during the year to take advantage of the entire amount you put in
the plan.
Planes, trains, and automobiles (and buses,
taxis, and trolleys . . .)
A significant part of our spending money goes towards getting ourselves
from one place to another. If you live close enough to wherever you need
to go each day so that you can walk or ride a bike, you are remarkably
fortunate. If you’re like most people, you fork over big bucks for some sort
of ride to your destination.

Spending Money on Required Expenses
40
You might want to keep track of your transportation expenses because you
travel for work and can arrange to get reimbursed for some of your costs. Or
maybe you split the cost of transportation with a fellow student or coworker
and need to tally up the expenses so you know what to charge your partner.
If your transportation is a tax-deductible expense, you definitely need to
keep track of all of your expenses. Here are some situations in which trans-
portation costs are tax-deductible:
✦Non-reimbursed work-related travel — other than your commute to and
from your workplace.
✦Cost of getting to and from tax-deductible classes, such as classes that
improve your skills at your job.
✦Traveling for medical purposes, such as trips to the doctor or clinic.
✦Traveling for charitable purposes, such as transporting Cub Scouts,
delivering Girl Scout cookies, carrying supplies for the church picnic, or
delivering meals to shut-ins.
✦Moving to a new home to take a job that is at least 50 miles farther away
from your old home than your old job.
When you keep track of the cost of your travel (using Quicken, of course!),
be sure to include not just the cost of your gas and car expenses, or public
transportation fares, but also parking, tolls, and any other related expenses.
Even if you pay cash for these expenses, you can track them in Quicken and
thus have a complete record of your transportation expenses.
Children, pets, parents, and other important people
It’s interesting to keep track of all that you spend on the people and animals
in your life. Not only does this information make for some entertaining con-
versation around the dinner table (“I’ll bet you can’t guess how much little
Sally’s diapers ran us last month — pass the gravy, please”), but there may
actually be some worthwhile reasons why you should know how much it
costs to take care of a family member.
✦If you’re considering adding to the family, you should be aware of how
much it costs to raise a child.
✦You may be considering taking in an elderly family member; you should
have an idea of how much it will cost to add another adult to the family.
✦The next time your child says you never do anything for him, you can be
prepared to put him in his place (at least until the next time he’s feeling
shortchanged).
✦A four-legged family member costs money too — if there’s talk of adding
a dog or a cat or some other sort of beast to the family, you should know
the costs involved.

If you already have a child or another person or a pet living in your household,
it’s not too difficult to calculate what it will cost to add another. You can start
with the specific costs of a current family member, such as clothing, educa-
tion, entertainment, medical bills, spending allowance, transportation. Add to
this a prorated portion of expenses that you pay for the whole family, such as
food, linens, furnishings, and electronic gadgets, and you’ll have a pretty good
idea of how much more it will cost to increase the family size.
The more difficult costs to allocate to individual family members are
expenses like housing, utilities, and insurance, amounts that you spend
anyway and would continue to spend at about the same rate, even if you
added to the family.
If you are new to the process of adding members to your household, your pro-
jections are done with a different approach — guessing. You’ve got no histori-
cal data to determine the cost of formula and baby wipes if you haven’t had a
child before. Likewise, the cost of frequent carpet cleaning and Frisbees is
hard to estimate if you’re considering your first pet. At least if you’re adding
an adult to the household, you can rely somewhat on your own experiences as
to what expenses lie ahead.
Of course, no matter what type of add-on you’re contemplating, you can esti-
mate all you want, but there’s only one certainty you can rely on: diapers (for
the very young or the very old), $39.95 in the economy-size box; dog treats,
$4.95 for a 20-ounce box; the joy of have a new member of the family, priceless!
Borrowing Money
For better or worse, borrowing money seems to be a permanent part of
today’s economic landscape. We borrow to purchase big-ticket items like
cars, homes, boats, and furniture. We borrow money every time we use our
credit cards, whether it’s for a new pair of jeans, a stereo system, dinner at a
restaurant, or a candy bar.
Some borrowing is secured debt, borrowing that is backed up by the item for
which the money was borrowed. For example, if you borrow money to pur-
chase a car, the car secures the debt. If you don’t make your payments, the
company from whom you borrowed the money can take your car.
When you agree to a loan for a specific amount of money, you agree to make
payments on that loan for a specified amount of time. Those payments
include interest as well as a payback of the amount you borrowed.
Before borrowing money, you need to understand what will be expected from
you in return for the loan. Know how much your payments will be and how
often they must be paid. Understand the penalties for making late payments,
and, for that matter, find out if there are penalties for making early payments.

Borrowing Money
42
At times, you may want to pay a loan off early, but the terms of the loan dis-
courage early payment. For example, you might have borrowed money to
make some improvements on your house. The loan is at a high rate of interest,
and the payment schedule stretches the loan out over five years, but you’d
like to pay back the loan in one or two years, thus significantly lowering the
effective interest rate. Be sure to check the terms of the loan before you sign
on the dotted line to make sure you can pay the loan off early. Some loans
come with early payment penalties to make sure the lender gets all the inter-
est even if you pay off the debt faster than the agreed-upon payment schedule.
Calculating loan interest
It probably comes as no surprise to you that borrowing money comes with a
price tag, and that price tag is known as interest. Interest is calculated based
on the amount of money you borrow; it’s a fee for the privilege of borrowing
the cash.
Banks and other financial institution lenders tend to be very up front about
the amount of interest they charge, the amount you will pay in periodic pay-
ments, and the total amount of the loan plus the interest that you have to
pay back. Bankers are capable of telling you with a completely straight face
that the $20,000 you borrow will be repayable in 300 easy installments of
$100, and that sounds completely reasonable to you, even though they also
tell you that comes to a total of $60,000. Hey, that’s $60,000 in tomorrow’s
money, and everyone knows that $20,000 today means a new car in your
garage, which easily trumps $60,000 in tomorrow’s money. There is stability
with a bank loan: You know what the rate of interest is, your payment is
always the same, and you know exactly when the loan will be paid off.
Credit card companies get sneaky with interest
Credit card companies are typically a little cagier than bank lenders. They
offer low interest rates to lure people to their cards, they have the right to
raise the rate, the date when interest starts accruing on your debt may vary
from one card to the next, and, rest assured, if you only pay the minimum
payment on your credit cards, you’ll probably be in debt forever.
The credit card company may tell you they’re offering an incredible 0 percent
interest, and you have to read really small print to see how short a time this
low non-interest rate will be in effect and what the actual rate will jump to
once you start making charges on the card.
There’s interest, and then there’s interest . . .
Two types of interest are most often applied to the amount you owe (and I’m
not referring to the descriptions of merely exorbitant and totally outrageous,
even though that might be what the interest seems like). The two most
common types of interest are simple interest and compound interest.

Book I
Chapter 2
Paying Bills
Using Credit Cards
43
Simple interest is interest applied only to the principal of your loan.
Compound interest is interest that is applied to the principal of the loan
plus any interest that has accrued. Bank loans are most often calculated
using simple interest. Credit cards use compound interest.
Using Credit Cards
Credit card borrowing is a form of unsecured debt. If you charge the cost of a
vacation on your credit card and then don’t get around to making the credit
card payments, the credit company can’t come and take away your vacation.
Even when you purchase something tangible with your credit card, like car
parts or body lotion, the items you purchased are safe from the credit com-
pany. That’s the good news.
The bad news is that credit card companies make their money by charging
interest. And lots of it. Each credit card company determines its own rate
and method for applying interest, so it makes sense to shop around for the
best deal.
Comparing rates
There are nearly as many credit card interest rates as there are credit card
companies. Every company has its own way of computing the interest, so
take the time to read the paperwork that comes with a credit card agree-
ment, even if it means getting out your magnifying glass. One credit card’s
15 percent interest rate doesn’t necessarily mean the same as 15 percent at
another company.
Some companies start charging interest the same day you make a purchase
on your credit card; others wait a certain number of days after you make a
charge before they begin assessing interest. Some companies assess interest
on a daily basis, others charge monthly. The worst-case scenario is the
credit card that assesses interest the day you make a charge and continues
to compound interest on a daily basis.
When shopping for a credit card, or, if you already have several, when decid-
ing which one to use, compare these features to determine which card gives
you the best rate:
✦Choose the card that carries the lowest interest rate (and not just for a
few months, but the lowest rate overall).
✦Choose the card that has the longest grace period between when you
make a charge and when they start assessing interest.
✦Choose the card that assesses the interest on the statement date instead
of daily.

Using Credit Cards
44
Making minimum payments
Your credit card statement includes a tempting offer to make a minimum pay-
ment. Beware of the minimum payment! Historically, the minimum payment
has been set at 2 percent to 5 percent of the amount you owe. So if your
credit card balance is $1,000, your minimum payment might be as low as $20.
If the credit card company assesses 21 percent interest, your payment of $20
may only knock off $2–$3 from the principal balance, and the rest of the pay-
ment will be used to pay interest. At that rate, if you only pay the minimum
payment, you will never pay off the loan.
Actually, if you pay nothing but the minimum balance, you would eventually
pay the credit card off, but, unless there is an incredible medical break-
through in the next few decades, you would have died long before that hap-
pens. Say you pay the minimum balance until the balance gets to $5.00, and
then you decide to pay off the remaining balance. You would have been
making payments for 164 years and would have paid $6,527 in interest on the
$1,000 balance.
For the record, credit card companies have been under pressure to raise the
minimum payment amount. Within the next 7 to 10 years, credit card compa-
nies are expected to increase the minimum payment to an amount that will
ensure the cardholder can make a dent in the principal balance.
Alternatively, say you use that $20 as your regular monthly payment, and you
never charge another amount on the card. It will take you 10 years to pay off
that $1,000, and your total interest will amount to about $1,400 if compounded
monthly, and about $1,450 if compounded daily. Yes, you read that correctly.
Paying only the $20 minimum payment each month means your interest alone
is about $1,400, not including the $1,000 in charged purchases.
On the surface, 21 percent interest on $1,000 sounds like it ought to be about
$210. Instead, the interest totals nearly half again as much as the entire
amount you charged.
Another way to think of the 21 percent interest is in terms of earning power.
Pay off the credit card that’s racking up 21 percent interest, and it’s like get-
ting 21 percent return on your investment (actually more, when you take the
compounding into consideration). That’s right. Save yourself the 21 percent
interest and it’s like investing your money and earning 21 percent. For this
reason, most analysts suggest that if you have extra cash on hand, you
should use it to first pay back your credit card balances before you invest it
in a savings account that’s earning a measly 2 percent or 3 percent interest.
It’s hard to beat a 21 percent return on investment.

Chapter 2

Using Credit Cards

Make late payments on your credit card, and your interest rate increases.
Credit card companies can also charge a late fee in addition to the interest
that keeps accruing (and that interest then starts accruing on the late fee as
well as the rest of the balance in the account).
The bottom line is, credit cards are convenient, no doubt, but don’t think
that credit card money is cheap. The cost can be astronomical.
Refinancing credit cards
In order to lure new customers, many credit card companies offer especially
low rates if you transfer a balance from another credit card. This can be a
great way of reducing the interest you pay on your credit card debt. But
once again, be sure you read the fine print. Here are some danger signals
to watch for:
✦Sometimes the credit card company charges a balance transfer fee, a
percentage of the amount you transfer. This fee is added to the trans-
ferred amount and interest is assessed on the fee.
✦The initial interest rate for transferring a balance may be quite attrac-
tive, but there may be a time limit on this rate, and then a higher rate
kicks in if you haven’t yet paid off the balance.
✦Although balances transferred from another credit card get assessed a low
interest rate, any new charges on the new credit card might get assessed a
rate even higher than you were paying on the previous credit card.
✦If you begin charging on this new credit card and make monthly pay-
ments that are less than the total, read the fine print to see how your
payments are applied. Often payments are applied to the transferred bal-
ance (the low-interest) balance first, and the new charges remain on the
account, getting assessed at the higher interest rate.
If you are considering transferring a balance to a new credit card, do the leg-
work. Create a spreadsheet that demonstrates how your payments will be
applied, how interest will accrue, and how new charges will be treated.
Compare these two scenarios over a period of however long you think it will
take to pay off the balance:
✦Scenario 1: Keep your charges on your old card and continue to pay at
the same rate you’ve been paying, estimating new charges based on past
performance.
✦Scenario 2: Transfer the charges to the new card, continue to make the
same payments you’ve been making, and estimate new charges based on
past performance.
Make sure you’re getting a bargain before making the transfer. Sometimes
those transfer deals really are too good to be true.

Mastering Good Credit
There’s no trick to having and keeping good credit. All you have to do is
borrow a little money or use credit cards from time to time to show you can
meet obligations, not take on any more debt than you can handle, and pay
your bills on time.
If you apply for a credit card or try to borrow money, the lender or the credit
card company will examine your credit history to determine if you are a
good credit risk. The better your credit history, the more likely it is you will
get the loan, the higher line of credit, or the new credit card.
Continue to maintain good credit, and credit card companies and banks will
come knocking on your door, trying to lend you more money.
If you have never borrowed money and never owned a credit card, chances
are you don’t have a credit history. Even though you might be the best credit
risk in the world, it’s possible you won’t be able to get a loan if you don’t
have a credit history.
If you’re the type of person who prefers to pay in cash, consider getting a
charge card just for the purpose of establishing a credit history. Charge a
few things, and make the payments on time. That’s all it takes to establish
yourself in the credit system. Then when the time comes, if you want to
borrow money for a house or car, you should be in good shape.
The credit agencies and their reports
If you have had any credit transactions in your own name, including stan-
dard credit cards like MasterCard and Visa, department store credit cards,
filling station cards, bank loans, and so on, you have a credit history. The
stores and businesses report your activity to credit agencies, and then the
agencies issue reports about your credit.
You have to authorize the issuance of a credit report. Whenever you apply
for credit, you sign a document that gives permission for the lender or com-
pany to request your credit report.
The credit report contains plenty of information about you:
✦The name of every company that you owe money to, the amounts you
owe, and your payment history including information about any late
payments and the date of your most recent payment
✦Your credit limit with the companies with which you have credit cards
✦Your mortgage company, if you own a home, the amount owed, and your
payment history

Book I

✦Your spouse’s name, if you are married, and information about which
debts are owned jointly
✦Your real weight (not the weight you put on your driver’s license) (just
kidding!)
✦Public records of liens, repossessions, foreclosures, and bankruptcies in
which you have been involved
There are three primary credit agencies in the U.S., and different lenders rely
on the information from any of the three agencies:
Experian
888-397-3742
P.O. Box 2002
Allen, TX 75013

Equifax
888-873-5392
P.O. Box 105851
Atlanta, GA 30348
www.equifax.com
You can request a copy of your credit report from any or all of these agen-
cies at any time for a fee. If you have been turned down for credit, ask the
lender which credit agency provided the report that resulted in your being
turned down, and that credit agency will provide you with a copy of the
report at no charge.
Get your credit reports for free
Recent legislation known as the Fair Credit
Reporting Act requires that each of the three
major credit reporting companies provide you
with a free copy of your credit report once each
year. You can request your free credit reports
online at www.annualcreditreport.
com. There you can either obtain online copies
of your reports or download request forms that
you can mail. You an also get information about

It’s worth the small fee (usually around $10) to see a copy of your credit
report from time to time, so you know what lenders are looking at when they
consider you for a loan or as a credit card candidate.
Your FICO score
In addition to the detailed credit reports, potential lenders look at your FICO
score. The FICO score is similar to the high score you got on the video game
down at your favorite pizza place last week, but not quite the same. And it’s
a darn shame that we can’t improve our credit ratings by practicing up on
video games.
FICO stands for Fair Isaac & Company, and this company has a secret mathe-
matical program (probably a lot like a video game) that analyzes the infor-
mation on your credit report and produces a score. The higher your score,
the better risk you are, at least as far as credit card companies and other
lenders are concerned.
FICO scores range from 300 to 850. A score of 300 means you’d better start
selling stuff on eBay if you need cash because you certainly aren’t going 
to get a loan. A score of 850 means you can charge anything you want: The
sky’s the limit. Most people fall somewhere in between.
FICO scores are updated continually, just like your credit reports, so anyone
who requests your credit report gets a current up-to-the-minute FICO score
to go along with the report.
You can find out your FICO score (for a small fee) on the FICO Web site, at
www.myfico.com, or you can order a copy of your score by phone at
800-342-6726.
FICO scores are not written in stone. If you’re disappointed with your FICO
scores, you can take steps to improve your score:
✦Don’t make late payments. This rule seems like a no-brainer, but in case
it hasn’t occurred to you, companies are more likely to lend you money
if they think you’re going to pay it back on time.
✦Don’t charge to the max on your credit cards. You don’t have to pay
the whole balance off each month, but leave yourself some wiggle room.
This keeps you from looking desperate.
✦Don’t take every credit card offer that comes your way. Too much
credit is too much of a good thing, and the FICO people start lowering
your score when you have “too many” credit cards. How many is too
many? FICO doesn’t say, but I’m guessing if you can’t fold your wallet
because of all the plastic, you probably have too many cards.

✦If you don’t have any credit cards, get one or two, use them, and make
the payments on time. This helps establish your reputation as a good
credit risk.
✦Give it time. If you haven’t had credit for long, or you’re trying to repair
bad credit, you need to work at establishing your good credit. Pay your
bills and keep your credit cards current, wait a year or two, and try for
that loan again.
✦Check for errors and get them corrected. Credit report companies
don’t know you — they just report what has been sent to them. A recent
study performed by PIRG (Public Interest Research Group) found that 25
percent of credit reports contain errors.
Correcting errors on credit reports
Examine your credit reports for errors and misrepresentations. It’s up to you
to stay on top of your credit history and make sure the reports contain accu-
rate information. If you find an error on your credit report, here’s what you
should do:
✦Contact the credit bureau and inform them of the mistake. The credit
bureau will send you a correction form that you need to fill out, explain-
ing the error and giving evidence of the correction. For example, if you
paid off an account and the credit bureau shows an amount still owing,
make a copy of your statement showing the last payment and send that
along with your correction form.
✦Notify the creditor. If the incorrect information on your credit report
was submitted by one of your creditors, get in touch with the creditor
and ask that corrected information be sent to the credit agencies.
✦Examine all three of your credit reports. Chances are good that if there
is a mistake on one credit report, there is a mistake on one or both of
the other reports too. Correcting the mistake with one credit agency
doesn’t automatically flow through to the other agencies — you might
need to send corrections to the other agencies as well.
✦Follow up. Give the credit agency (or agencies) two or three months to
get your records straightened out after you make a correction request,
and then request copies of your credit report(s) again to make sure the
corrections have been made.
There is a seven-year statute of limitations on credit information. If an
account has been closed or late payments were made or anything else nega-
tive about you appears on your credit report (like that thing about the fake
weight you put on your driver’s license), after seven years, the record must
be purged. If unfavorable information on your report is more than seven

Mastering Good Credit
50
years old, contact the credit agency and ask them to remove the outdated
information. Likewise, if unfavorable information appears on your report and
you’re coming up on seven years, get ready to celebrate: Your FICO score is
about to improve!
You can add comments on your credit report. If you think the presentation of
information on your report is misleading, you are entitled to add a 100-word
statement explaining your side of the story.

ere’s a working definition of budget: (`b j• t) Noun. 1. A plan to show
how much money a person or organization will earn and how much
they will need or be able to spend. 2. A plan for the coordination of resources
and expenditures. 3. The amount of money you have available to spend.
Setting Goals
Everyone knows what a budget is. A budget is the way some people, like
parents, for example, try to make you believe you can’t have something you
really want because there are more important things to buy, like Stove Top
Stuffing and car engine repairs.
“Sorry dear, it’s just not in the budget,” is a common refrain heard through-
out childhood, but what kids don’t know is that, chances are, there actually
is no budget.
Technically, everyone can be said to have a budget in that we all make con-
scious decisions about whether we can afford to buy something. And, for
most people, that’s what a budget is — all in the mind.
Budgeting, after all, is a process of knowing what you can afford and spend-
ing accordingly. Or not. Many people use budgets as an excuse for not
buying boring things they’re supposed to buy (“Gee, I wish I could afford to
get that noisy squeak in the air conditioner repaired, but it’s just not in the
budget”) when in the next breath, they’re busy proposing something fun and
much more useful to do with their “extra” money (“Hey, let’s go to the river-
boat and drop a few hundred bucks at the blackjack table!”).
To create and use a budget successfully, a budget should be a formal plan,
printed out on paper, designed to help you control spending, monitor income,
and plan for future expenses so they don’t creep up and bite you. And if your
dreams include gambling on the riverboat, replacing the air conditioner, a

college education, a comfortable retirement, or even a lifetime supply of Stove
Top Stuffing, no problem. Just make your dreams part of the budget and map
out a plan for how and when you can afford to realize your goals.
P.S.: If your dreams seem out of reach, all the more reason for a budget.
You’ll get yourself a dose of financial reality, be able to assess the likelihood
of achieving your goals on your current income, and figure out how much
more you will have to earn or how much longer you will have to work to
have the things you want.
If you live alone, your budget creation is a personal event. But when you live
in a family, and the budgeting affects all family members, there should be
some planning in which all family members can participate.
Parents should resist the temptation to try to make their children feel guilty
about the fact that certain individuals (that is, the grown-ups) go out and
work hard and earn a living so that certain other individuals (that is, those
who stay home and wear diapers and watch Nickelodeon) get to reap the
benefits of that labor. Such discussions end up being battles over the relative
merits of television programming like SpongeBob SquarePants, and parents
always lose these arguments.
Instead of getting trapped in the mire of intellectual discourse with your five-
year-old, as parents (and rulers of the family unit), you have the right not to
have to share every detail about your finances with the children. However,
keep in mind the fact that by allowing children to participate in or at least
listen to the financial decision-making process, they learn a valuable lesson
to take into their own adult lives (aside from the knowledge that some day
they too will get to make the rules). Also, if the kids know up front what the
family has agreed upon as necessary as well as luxury expenses, there might
be less whining when they start lusting after expensive items.
Budgeting, Family-Style
Few things in life are more fun than sitting around with your family mem-
bers, cheerfully discussing how to spend a limited amount of money. Getting
teeth drilled comes to mind as a pleasant alternative.
In spite of the fact that some people have difficulty discussing money issues,
the time spent creating a budget with the other members of your family pays
off, so to speak, in an organized and meaningful approach to both short-term
and long-term financial goals. Working with your family members to see the
big picture means the entire family can take pride when financial goals are
achieved.
Goal-setting is most effective when there is some element of realism con-
nected with the goals you choose to strive for. If your family income is limited

to $20,000 per year, a plan to live in a Beverly Hills estate with a vacation
home on the French Riviera and a Park Avenue condo for those occasional
trips to New York City may be a little far-fetched.
But the nicest part about the initial goal-setting family meeting that you’re
going to schedule is that all wishes can be heard and considered. Gather the
family, set out some nice snacks or order everybody’s favorite take-out, and
start making lists. The first list everyone should make is a wish list. Go ahead:
Pull out the stops, list everything you can think of that would truly make you
happy. You don’t have to go nuts with lists of extravagant items just for the
sake of seeing the names of these items in print. Consider what you really
dream for, what would truly make your life complete, and put it in writing.
Your family goal-setting meeting should have the following characteristics:
✦Time should be set aside specifically for the meeting
✦All interested family members should attend
✦There should be paper and a writing instrument for each person present
✦Keep an open mind when listening to ideas of other family members
The one rule you need to follow when making initial budget-session wish
lists is that no family member should be made to feel bad about something
on his or her list. The first wish lists are for fun, and there’s nothing wrong
with dreaming a little. Furthermore, you’re certain to learn something about
your family members. It can be very informative to learn the true desires of
your siblings, spouse, or parents.
Prioritizing your goals
After you’ve created lists of the financial goals each family member hopes 
to achieve, you need to assign priority values to those goals. Have each
person go through his own list and number the goals on the list starting with
number one as the most important goal.
Share your ideas with one another, discussing which goals are the most
important to each of you and what makes those goals important. Help each
other decide which goals belong at the top of each person’s list and why.
Pricing your goals
How much do these goals cost? You’ve got to examine the lists, and estimate
how much each goal costs. Don’t worry if your estimates are off base. The
idea is to get a general sense of how much money is at stake with these
goals. That information is helpful when you start thinking about how long it’s
going to take to actually achieve these goals.

Creating Your Budget
54
Setting a price on goals can be a difficult task for children, so parents, here’s
where you have to take charge. Tell your children how much money is
involved in order to achieve the goals they have on their lists. This might
be extremely eye-opening, especially for children who have a sense of the
value of money.
As you discuss each of the goals on your lists, consider how important those
goals are to you. Do you really need all these things, or would just some of
them suffice? You may be able to cross some of the goals off your lists before
you continue to the next step.
Determining the length of time for achieving goals
In addition to assigning priorities to your goals, you must determine how long
each goal will take to accomplish. Again, this is just an estimate. Give your best
guess in which category each of the goals on all of the lists should fall:
✦1 year: Goals that need to be achieved within one year. For example,
tuition for a family member who is currently in college, a new bicycle for
a child who has outgrown her current model, or replacing the furnace
that died at the end of last winter.
✦2–5 years: Goals that you want to achieve within five years. Examples
might include orthodontic work for a family member, an expensive
vacation like a cruise or a trip overseas, a new car, or elimination of
existing debt.
✦6–10 years: Goals that you hope to achieve within the next ten years.
For example, a college education for a child currently in grade school,
a move to a new home, new furnishings, an investment in some stocks
with an eye toward retirement.
This goal-setting exercise is an important part of budgeting. It’s one thing to
budget for your current and ongoing living expenses — those items of
course are a necessary part of budgeting because they are required
expenses. But the real fun in budgeting comes not from having money to pay
the electric bill, but in finding the ability to make your dreams come true.
Creating Your Budget
You probably have a pretty accurate idea of how much money you earn on a
monthly or yearly basis. You probably also have a fairly good idea of how
much you spend, based on how much you have left in the bank at the end of
each month. But do you have a clear sense of specifically how you spend
your money, month in and month out?
The first part of budgeting involves developing an estimate of your cash
inflow and outflow on a monthly basis. After you know how much you make

Book I
Chapter 3
Budgeting
Creating Your Budget
55
and how your money is spent, you can see clearly where changes can be
made, if changes are needed. You can also use your income and expense
summary to examine what you have to work with so that you can create a
budget that enables you to start planning for your goals.
Your budget starting point
The best starting point for a budget is a recap of past activity. If possible,
you should go back a whole year, or even two years, and make a detailed list
of your monthly income and expenses for that time frame. As you’ll see in
Book IV, Chapter 5, if you already use Quicken, you’ll find that collecting this
information is quite easy. If you are new to Quicken, you’ll have to spend
some time going back over your paper bank records for the past year or two
if you want to get detailed information.
Your goal in this exercise is to create an estimate of your income and
expenses for the next 12 months.
An alternative to collecting the detail from the past year or two is to start from
scratch, doing the best you can to estimate what you think your monthly
income will be going forward, and taking a stab at your monthly expenses.
You may need to spend a couple of months keeping detailed records of
your spending in order to get a grasp of how your money is actually spent.
Especially if you’re the type of person who spends a lot of cash without record-
ing how the money is spent, you may not realize where you spend all your
money. Carry a notebook or PDA with you for a month or two and record every
expenditure. Then work these expenses into your list of personal expenses.
Don’t hesitate to get picky when recording your cash expenses. You may think
that $5 spent on coffee and a newspaper each day is negligible, but when
you’re trying to figure out where all your money goes, $5 times five days a
week times 52 weeks per year is $1,300, and that’s an amount worth tracking.
At this point, you can probably excuse the children from the room. Unless
you’ve raised a son like the Alex P. Keaton character in the old Family Ties
television show, your children probably won’t be terribly interested in the
intricacies of budgeting, especially the costs of running a household.
Furthermore, you may feel that some of the budget information, like how
much you make at your job or how much is spent on the household, is not
necessarily relevant to your children.
Particularly young children might not be able to exercise discretion regarding
private family financial information. And while you may be perfectly willing 
to share information with your children, you may not want the information
shared with the neighbors, parents of your children’s friends, or teachers at
their school.

Determining average monthly income
When considering your monthly income, include any of the following items
that apply to you:
✦Income from your job and your spouse’s job, net of any taxes that are
withheld. If you are self-employed, reduce your net business income by
the amount of taxes you expect to owe on this income.
✦Interest you earn on bank savings account and other interest-bearing
investments.
✦Dividends on stocks that you own and earnings on mutual fund
investments.
✦Tax-deferred amounts earned in your retirement fund. Even though you
don’t have immediate access to this money, the earnings are yours and
should be included with your budgeted earnings.
Determining an average monthly amount of income is easy if you earn the
same amount of money each month. But if your income varies from month
to month, or is seasonal, or is just completely unreliable, there is some addi-
tional work involved in determining a monthly amount of income.
Do your best to estimate. For purposes of this exercise, you can either esti-
mate an annual amount of income and divide by 12 to get a monthly estimate
of your income, or you can estimate your income month by month, allowing
for the seasonal or other fluctuations that you expect to occur.
Determining average monthly expenses
The other start-up part of creating a budget involves estimating monthly
expenses. Again, keep in mind that some expenses do not occur each month.
For example, you might pay automobile insurance only once or twice a year.
When drawing up a 12-month estimate, you can either average expenses
evenly throughout the year, or place the infrequent expenses in the month
where they belong.
Everyone’s monthly expenses are different, but here is a list of the most
common household and personal expenses you might encounter and should
consider for your budget:
✦Rent or mortgage.
✦Utilities: Electricity, gas, water, sewer, trash service.
✦Transportation: Gas and oil, public transportation, auto payments, auto
repair and maintenance, auto insurance.
✦Medical care: Health insurance, doctor and dentist visits, ongoing med-
ications, contact lenses.

Book I
Chapter 3
Budgeting

57
✦Children: Education fees, day care, diapers, school lunches.
✦Clothing.
✦Job-related costs: Tools, books, dry cleaning, uniforms, union dues,
lunches, parking, professional dues, professional liability insurance.
✦Debt service: Loan payments, interest on credit card bills (the actual
amounts you charge on your credit card should go in the proper cate-
gories such as food, clothes, and so on).
✦Insurance: Life insurance, property insurance, any insurance not
included elsewhere.
✦Pets: Food, boarding, veterinarian, equipment.
✦Charity: Religious organizations, other not-for-profit organizations.
✦Gifts: Birthdays, other holidays, graduations, anniversaries, showers,
weddings.
✦Entertainment: Movies, restaurants, sporting events, concerts, CDs,
night clubs, vacations, videos, newspapers, magazines, books.
✦Personal: Hair care, makeup and other toiletries, fitness.
✦Savings: Short-term and long-term savings investments including contri-
butions to retirement funds. Include the amount you recorded in the
income section that is being routed to a retirement fund at your job.
The items on the above lists are not meant to appear in any particular order
but instead are presented to give you an idea of the kinds of things you want
to consider when creating your budget.
If you’re uncertain about how much to enter in your budget for some items,
err on the side of overstating expense and understating income. That way
you’ll be covered if the bills come in higher than expected or your income
takes a drop.
Budgeting for unforeseen events
No matter how well you plan, there is always the risk that some unexpected
event occurs and completely throws off your financial plans. For that reason,
financial analysts recommend keeping an emergency fund on hand, a cash
reserve representing three to five months worth of living expenses, designed
to get you through rough times and unexpected setbacks.
The emergency fund is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book. For
now, the important thing is to remember your emergency fund when creating
your budget. If you already have an emergency fund, you don’t need to budget
an additional expense to provide for this fund, but if you don’t have such a
fund, or if you have used up some or all of your emergency fund, you need to
add an amount to set aside for your emergency fund into your budget.

Budgeting for your goals
Finally we get to the fun part of creating a budget (unless of course you’re a
numbers geek, in which case everything you’ve done budget-wise so far has
been fun). The really fun part is getting to incorporate your goals into your
budget.
Keep in mind that there has been no discussion yet of making ends meet.
That’s OK. Right now we’re just listing income and expenses as they exist
today, without any concern as to whether or not you have enough money to
meet your monthly expenses.
For each of your goals that fall into the 1-year category, take the total cost of
achieving that goal, divide the cost by 12, and add that item to your budget
with 1⁄12th of the cost in each month of your monthly budget.
For longer-term goals, such as 5- or 10-year goals, divide the estimated cost
by the number of years you anticipate it will take to achieve that goal, divide
the resulting number by 12, and add that item to your budget as well.
The idea is that you start now to save for your long-term goals, putting aside
a little each month, so that when you’re ready to enjoy those goals, the
money will be available.
The suggestion that you budget for the entire cost of your goals is based on
the assumption that you have not yet begun to save for these goals. If, for
example, you already have a college fund in place for your child, or if you
expect to receive a quantity of money in the future, perhaps from an inheri-
tance, and plan to use that money to fund your goals, you don’t need to
budget for those goals currently.
All of this long-range budget planning is being done in today’s dollars, without
any adjustment for the future value of the money. In truth, if you start saving
today for an expenditure that is 10 years away, you can put aside less than
1⁄120th of the total cost (1⁄120th = total cost divided by 10 years, divided by 12
months in a year) because you plan to invest your money each month and the
earnings on the money add to the total available for the goal.
You may be wondering what you should do with the money you set aside for
your savings goals. If your budget works the way you want it to, you’ll have
additional money to put aside for mid-term and long-term goals. Consider
investing the money so that it earns interest or dividends and thus provides
even more income toward your goals.
If some of the money you’ve saved is earmarked for long-term goals, you
have the flexibility of investing not just in the liquid investments that can be
accessed quickly like mutual funds or savings accounts, but in long-term
investments such as bonds, treasury bills, or certificates of deposit.

Balancing your budget
After you’ve created a breakdown of your anticipated income and expenses
for the coming year, look over the entries in your budget and determine how
reasonable those amounts are. Look for errors and omissions, keep an eye
out for unreasonable amounts, and remember that you’re trying to imagine
what your financial life is really going to be like for the next year.
Finally, get out the calculator and see how close you come to having enough
income to meet all of your expenses and your goals. Add up all of your
income for each month, add up all of your expenses for each month, cross
your fingers, and subtract. If you’re left with a positive number, you can cele-
brate! If your budgeted expenses are greater than your income, it’s time to
start figuring out how you’re going to make ends meet.
Say that all of your expenses are enough to use up all of your monthly
income and there is nothing left for future goal planning. This is frequently
the case, as many people adjust their lifestyles so that they can live pay-
check to paycheck, leaving nothing or very little left over for saving.
This is where budgeting gets interesting. It’s time to analyze your spending
and decide what’s really important, where you can make changes, and, pos-
sibly, what has to go. Here are a few important considerations to remember:
✦Your financial lifestyle is not written in stone. If you suddenly experi-
enced a drop in pay or a loss of a job, you would have to make changes
in your lifestyle. You can make lots of little changes that together have a
big effect on the bottom line. See “Living within your means” later in this
chapter for tips on making adjustments that really add up.
✦Ease into your budget. If you’re new to saving, you’re going to feel like
you are making a sacrifice by tucking money away in savings instead of
spending the money.
✦Start small. If you’re new to setting money aside for saving, start by
trying to put away 5 percent of your income each month for saving. After
you get used to making saving a regular part of your lifestyle, you can
try to increase this amount. Five percent may not be enough savings to
cover your goals. Save 1–2 percent for a few months, and then work up
to a higher level of savings.
✦Consider ways to increase your income. Expenses aren’t the only flexible
part of your budget. See the section called “Increasing your earnings” later
in this chapter.
Using your budget
OK: You finished creating a budget that meets your financial needs, allows
enough money to cover your operating expenses and, with luck, leaves some
left over for saving. Now what?

Creating Your Budget

The idea is not to stash the budget in your desk drawer, but to actively use
the budget by referring to it often, comparing your real performance with
the budget plan, making spending decisions based on the information in
your budget, and, if necessary, working toward improving the budget so that
you can ultimately meet all of your financial goals.
Here are some tips for making use of your budget:
✦Each month, summarize your actual income and expenses, and then
compare the real activity to your budgeted activity. Quicken helps you
do this effortlessly.
✦When differences arise between actual and budgeted amounts, note the
differences and determine what caused them. You don’t need to change
your budget each month; just know why you aren’t in agreement, and save
that information for later, when it’s actually time to make some changes.
Sometimes budget differences are simply differences in timing. An
expense you thought you would incur next month actually came in this
month instead. Or income you were expecting this month is delayed
until a later date. There’s certainly no reason to amend your budget for
simple changes like this. Just take the little timing differences in stride,
knowing things will even out in a month or two.
✦Keep track of your spending during the month and try not to let yourself
spend more than the budget permits. If you decided to budget $100 a
month for eating out, and you’ve already spent that much three weeks into
the month, stay home for the rest of the month and don’t eat out. When it
comes to discretionary spending, using your budget is just that simple.
✦Remember to keep track of your cash spending as well as checks, credit
card spending, and debit cards. All of these spending options need to be
tracked and compared to your budget.
✦After a few months have passed, if your budget is not working out, it’s time
to reassess the amounts you put in your budget to determine if they are
reasonable. After you have a bit of a track record to compare your budget
to, you can start fine-tuning the budget so that it works with your lifestyle.
The budget can’t help you control your spending by itself. If your spending is
out of control, don’t just change the budget to match your spending. Carefully
analyze your spending and determine how you can improve your habits.
✦Spending isn’t the only part of a budget. Remember to compare your
income to the amounts recorded in the budget and make sure you are
earning and bringing home the amounts you budgeted. Analyze any dif-
ferences and determine where any problems might lie.
✦If income exceeds your budgeted amount, determine how you want to
use the additional income, or adjust your savings goals so that perhaps
you can speed up the time in which those goals are to be achieved.

Living within your means
Sometimes budgeting means cutting expenses. But cutting expenses doesn’t
have to translate into changing your lifestyle. Try some of these tips for
adjusting your spending without cutting into your way of living.
Cut back on utilities
Go beyond the obvious habits of turning off lights when you leave the room
and dialing down the heat while you wear extra layers. Here are some ideas
for saving on the cost of utilities:
✦Consider upgrading insulation and storm windows and also check for and
repair drafts. Some states give tax credits or deductions for this type of
expense, so not only do you improve the efficiency of your utilities and
the comfort of your home, you can save money on taxes too!
✦Try turning down the temperature on your water heater, especially when
leaving home for several days at a time.
✦Don’t go nuts with air conditioning in the summer or heat in the winter.
Use these utilities frugally and just when you need them. Consider
installing ceiling and attic fans to move the air around instead of relying
on the furnace and air conditioner to do all the work.
✦Turn off music and television when you’re not watching/listening, or
when you leave the house.
✦Time yourself in the shower and try to beat your previous times. Turn
off the water when shampooing or shaving, and then turn it back on
again to rinse.
✦Check furnace filters and have regular cleaning and maintenance done
on the furnace and air conditioner. Consider upgrading to a more energy
efficient system if you’re still operating on an old system. Call an HVAC
service person to get a free estimate of how much a new system costs
and the relating savings on utilities. Modern systems can pay for them-
selves in a very short period of time.
✦Switch to cold water in your washing machine.
✦Wait until the dishwasher is full to run a load. Wash the big items by
hand in the sink so that you can accommodate a greater quantity of
smaller items in the dishwasher.
✦Close vents and doors in rooms you don’t use so that the heat and air
conditioning aren’t wasted.
✦See if your utility companies offer a year-round average cost program.
This is a useful budgeting tool to help even out your costs throughout
the year. You don’t pay any extra under this program, but the exorbitant
costs for winter heat and summer air conditioning get spread throughout
the year.

Creating Your Budget
62
✦Check out the possibility of installing a timer on your thermostat so that
turning down the heat or air conditioning at night or when you’re away
from home is taken care of automatically.
✦Use timers or motion detectors on outside lights so that they’re not
turned on all the time.
✦If you don’t make a lot of long distance calls, consider canceling your
long distance service and buying phone cards for your long distance.
That way, you only pay for the calls you make. Another option for saving
on long distance is to take advantage of any available long distance serv-
ice on your cell phone.
✦Read your telephone bills and make sure all of the auxiliary charges are
correct and that the long distance calls are to numbers you recognize.
Test the results of your changes. Check your utility meters to determine
your usage before implementing some of these changes. Then try one or two
adjustments at a time for a month or two and check the meters at the end of
each month to see if your utility usage has changed.
Don’t operate in the dark (no pun intended). Read your utility bills rather
than just paying them, and do the math to determine how much your utility
usage actually costs. Then when you notice changes in the usage on your
meters, you really know how much you are saving.
Cut back on other expenses too
Utilities aren’t the only area where you can trim expenses. Here are some
general tips for cutting daily living expenses.
✦Save money on postage and envelopes by paying bills online. You’ll
see in Book IV, Chapter 4 that it’s easy to pay bills through Quicken.
Also, many banks offer their own online bill payment services.
✦Install a smoke detector and a security system. Not only do these items
afford protection, but their usage may enable you to reduce your home-
owner’s or renter’s insurance costs.
✦Buy in bulk. Shop with a friend; look for bargains often found by buying
food, cleaning supplies, and other common items in bulk. Share the sav-
ings, and then split the items with your friend if you don’t need the
entire bulk amount.
✦Make sure you’re getting all the savings to which you’re entitled on
your automobile insurance. If you have been ticket-free for several
years, you should qualify for a rate reduction. Use the same company for
homeowner’s/renter’s insurance, personal health insurance, long-term
care insurance, and life insurance as you do for auto insurance, and your
overall rates can be reduced because many insurance companies give
discounts for multiple policies. Teenage drivers get lower rates for high

grades in school. If you live in a large metropolis, your insurance rates
can be reduced if you don’t drive into the city for work. Make sure your
insurance agent knows how you use your vehicle.
✦Do all of your errands for the week in one trip. You’ll save both time
and gas money.
✦If you’re paying for your bank checking account, shop around. Many
banks offer free checking, and sometimes you can even get cash incen-
tives to move your money to a different bank.
✦Pay your bills on time! Avoid late fees! Duh!
✦Increase the deductible amounts on your insurance policies. The sav-
ings on premiums can usually offset the increase in the deductible
within a couple of years.
✦If you’re paying for daycare so two parents can work, consider switch-
ing one parent to a different shift so that there is always one parent at
home. You’ll do away with the daycare costs and might even increase
the household income if one parent switches to a shift that pays more.
✦Stop eating out. Eating out can really get expensive, and you can eat
more and better food for less at home. Learn some new recipes, or cook
and freeze meals for busy nights when there’s no time for food prepara-
tion. If you enjoy a particular type of restaurant food, invest in a good
cookbook for that style of food, and teach yourself how to cook your
favorite dishes.
✦Cut the cost of magazine subscriptions. If you like to have a lot of maga-
zines to read, consider waiting a month or two and buying them cheap
at book sales or used book stores. Also look online for bargains on new
subscription costs.
These are just a few tips to get you started. See what you and your family
can come up with to save additional money, and try to keep track of how
much you actually save.
Do you prepare your own income tax returns? If so, you might want to con-
sider meeting with a professional tax preparer to have your previously filed
tax returns analyzed. Find out if you’re preparing the returns correctly and if
there are any cost-saving measures you can employ that will help you cut
your taxes. If the advice you receive is beneficial, you might want to have the
professional prepare your tax returns in the future.
Increasing your earnings
Cutting expenses is one way to improve on your monthly bottom line.
Another way is to increase income. Your first reaction might be that your job
pays what it pays, and there’s no way to bring more money into the home. If
more money is what you want, try experimenting with some of these ideas
for adding to the family coffers.

✦Think ahead. What would it take in terms of effort, time commitment,
and skills to advance to a higher paying position at your job? If it’s a 
promotion or raise you want, ask your employer how you can learn the
skills you need for the next level of income or advancement.
✦Find out what other employers are offering for the same skills. Do you
like what you’re doing but think you could earn more money elsewhere?
Shop around discreetly and maybe you’ll find a better situation, doing
the same work but for higher pay.
✦Look into overtime opportunities at your job. Alternatively, ask if there
are additional responsibilities you can take on that can improve your
position and eventually your pay. Maybe switching from days to
evenings or nights for awhile can result in a bigger paycheck.
✦Consider taking another job, at least for a short time. Many retail
employers hire part-time workers during the holiday season in November
and December. Other employers have different busy seasons and might
offer various types of seasonal or shift work.
✦Invest and save. The more you save, the more your money works for
you. Invest your savings from various cost-cutting measures that you
implement and watch your income grow.
✦Sell personal possessions you no longer want. Perhaps you can sell a
collection you no longer want, or items you inherited that aren’t special
to you to bring some income into your home.
✦Pursue continuing education. You might want to return to school at
night or take courses online to improve your skills and make yourself a
candidate for a better-paying position.
There are plenty of opportunities to make money out of your hobbies and
interests. If you love gardening, see if you can help others in the neighbor-
hood with their gardens, for a fee. You can even bring your children along
and let them help, and give them part of the fee as a reward. Do you love to
read? Maybe writing book reviews for the local newspaper can pay off. Are
you good with children? Nanny/babysitting services are always in demand.
Are you a good cook? Consider catering small parties as an additional source
of income. Ask your family members for suggestions. They might recognize
skills of yours that you don’t even realize you have!
When budgeting fails
Sometimes the budget you made just doesn’t do the job. Don’t give up on
your budget if things aren’t working out for the first few months. Give your-
self a chance to make the budget work; try various methods of increasing
earnings or cutting back on expenses if necessary. By all means, analyze
your experiences carefully and make sure you understand why the budget
isn’t working.

Top ten reasons why a budget fails:
✦Unanticipated costs. You thought you planned for every contingency,
but then there was that car accident and you needed to buy a new car,
or the dog bit a neighbor’s child and you’re stuck with the medical bills,
or your daughter gets married and brings the new out-of-work husband
home to join the family. You get the picture. (See “Starting an Emergency
Fund” in Chapter 4 of Book I.)
✦Unreasonable expectations. You were certain you could cut your spend-
ing by 20 percent, but it’s just not happening.
✦Change in lifestyle. You lose your job, you have a baby, you’re ready to
retire, there’s a death in the family, you get married, you get divorced,
you move, you go back to school, you join the armed forces, you have a
midlife crisis, or, oh my God!, all of the above!
✦Investments don’t work out. That oil well turned out to be a dry hole.
✦Forgotten items. Oops! What about birthday gifts for the nieces and
nephews? How about those school tuition bills? Or that annual life insur-
ance renewal that sneaks up on you each year? And oh yeah, there’s the
money you give to charity. Sometimes it’s hard to think of everything the
first time you make a budget. Don’t worry — you’ll get the hang of it.
✦Giving up without trying. Budgeting seemed like a good idea at the 
time . . . Maybe next month we’ll try again, after we go on the vacation . . .
✦Failure to keep track of spending. It’s soooooo hard to remember to
write down everything. Especially out-of-pocket cash expenses.
✦Cheating. If you cheat on your budget, there’s not much point in having
one, is there?
✦Not understanding how a budget works. A budget is a tool, not a rule.
Use the budget to learn more about your spending habits and your
income potential. Work with the numbers so they provide a reasonable
representation of your financial lifestyle. Then compare real life to the
budget and analyze the differences. Use that information to fine-tune
your budget so that the budget works for you and provides you with a
workable financial plan.
So what do you do when your budget doesn’t work? You have three choices:
✦Start over, this time with more determination to make the budget plan
stick.
✦Take some time off, rethink the budget, try again in a few months.
✦Fix it.

Notice that “Give up” is not among the options listed above. Yes, you can
give up if you really don’t think you’re cut out for budgeting. But there are
better choices. Instead of giving up, try to figure out how to make the budget
work for you. A careful analysis of the problem areas should provide you
with the information you need to make some useful changes.
Budget time, take two
If at first you don’t succeed . . . you can always start over again. If you’ve
never used a budget before, the first few months can be daunting. But if
you’re confident that the amounts you put in your budget are truly work-
able, a few months of practice may be all it takes to get you and your family
on track.
Remember to really examine your budget each month, comparing your
actual income and expenses to those listed on the budget. But don’t stop
there. Analyze what went wrong (and what went right) and make a con-
certed effort to correct the problems next month.
Maybe some of the changes you tried to institute were too drastic. Giving up
daily trips to Starbucks or Friday night drinks at your favorite watering hole
or the latest bestseller in hardback can be a difficult lifestyle adjustment. So
ease into the change, and commit to getting yourself on track within a few
months instead of all at once.
Consider the possibility that your budget might need adjusting. See
“Changing your budget” below for information on how to tweak the budget.
Prepare yourself for the possibility of your income not being enough to
cover your expenses. If possible, set aside a bit of extra cash to meet unex-
pected expenses or deal with emergencies. And don’t just prepare yourself
monetarily. Understand that budgets aren’t perfect and they often need cor-
recting. Don’t feel like you’ve failed if the budget doesn’t work out the first
time. If you’re dedicated to making the budget work, you’ll figure out how to
get it right.
Maybe all you need is a budget breather. If you’re confident that the reason
your budget isn’t working is a problem with the execution and not with the
numbers in the budget, take a break, and then dig in again and see if you
can’t make it work the next time.
Changing your budget
A budget is a work in progress. Even if your budget works perfectly for you
in the beginning, you’re going to need to make changes as your income and
expenses change over the years.

Chapter 3

At least once a year, and more often if you’re still working at getting your
budget right, take the time to seriously analyze your actual income and
spending compared to the budgeted amounts you started with. Reassess
goals with your family, and determine the root of any changes in spending
and income expectations.
If you find yourself with more money than you originally budgeted for, don’t
take that excess as an excuse for extravagance. Instead, consider your list of
goals and see where the money can be best utilized. You can chip away at
some of those long-term goals, or fund your emergency reserve.
Borrowing and your budget
No matter how well you plan for the future, unexpected events can occur. If
your budget won’t handle certain expenses, you can work borrowed money
into the budget scheme.
Record borrowed money as additional income coming in, and set up a repay-
ment plan as an expense of your budget.
Charging purchases on your credit cards is a form of borrowing. If you
charge expenses on credit cards and don’t pay the amounts off in the same
month, be sure to increase your budgeted expenses to allow for the repay-
ment of those charges.
If borrowing is out of control, or if the debt repayments including credit card
payments are eating away at your ability to put money away and save, con-
sider debt counseling. A professional debt counselor can help you organize
your debts, negotiate payment plans, and generally stay out of trouble.
Budgeting for life
Probably the most important benefit that comes from budgeting is that you
know how much money you have, where the money is scheduled to go, and
you can determine when and how you are going to achieve your goals.
Instead of hoping that someday your financial goals will be achieved, you
know which ones you’re going to reach and when they will be reached.
After you’ve settled on a budget that works, you have a plan in place that
enables you to reach your goals.

 Setting up an emergency fund

T
aking care of yourself and your family involves more than keeping your
door locked, letting the dog outside frequently, and setting curfew hours
for your children. For some, protection comes in the form of a shotgun or a
Rottweiler. But this kind of protection only goes so far. The shotgun, for exam-
ple, might protect you if you walk in on a robber in the act of cleaning out the
silverware drawer, but it won’t get you a new heart when your Timex stops
ticking (although that gun trick worked pretty well for Denzel Washington in
John Q). So the point is, no matter what your preferred manner of watching
your back, financial protection should be part of the big picture.
Creating an Emergency Fund
There are many types of insurance, and most are purchased through an
insurance broker or arranged for by your employer. But the one type of
insurance that you can provide for yourself is an emergency fund.
Purchased insurance policies cover specific types of emergencies: auto acci-
dents, poor health, damage to property, and even death. With an emergency
fund, you name the emergency. The only limit to what your emergency fund
can cover is the amount of money you put in the fund. There’s no paperwork
to fill out, and no one’s permission to ask when you want to take the money.
Envisioning the emergency scenario
For most people, life goes on, day after day, with very little change. Especially
when it comes to finances, we become accustomed to a routine — paychecks
at regular intervals for a predictable amount, the same bills each month,
allowances for the kids. Occasionally, an unexpected expense crops up, but
we usually find a way to get that paid.
Then an emergency strikes. “Restructuring” at the office means you lose
your job, and suddenly that regular paycheck disappears, as does your
health insurance, your afternoon trips to Starbucks, and your self-esteem.
While you’re trying to pull your life back together, who’s going to pay the
bills? A little rainy day money would come in quite handy.

Creating an Emergency Fund

Determining how much to save
Financial analysts suggest a cash reserve of at least three months worth of
living expenses, and a reserve of five months of expenses is recommended,
especially for couples. This emergency reserve doesn’t have to be enough
money to cover all of your monthly expenses, just the necessities. Expenses
that are optional, such as tickets to events or dining out, do not have to be
covered by your emergency fund.
To determine what constitutes necessary living expenses, go back to the
budget you drew up in the previous chapter. When you constructed your
budget, you listed your monthly living expenses, costs like rent or mortgage
payment, utilities, insurance, food, and so on.
Examine the list, and just write down the expenses that are absolutely neces-
sary. Then add up those amounts. The total represents one month of emer-
gency expenses.
If you do not already have an emergency fund in place, determine how much
you need and how long it will take you to save the money for this fund, and
then add a monthly amount to your family budget to start saving for your
emergency stash.
Some people intentionally skip creating an emergency fund because they
know they have good borrowing power and think they’ll just borrow money
if they get in a bind. Although this may work for some, sometimes a situa-
tion, such as a job loss, negates your borrowing power or your ability to
make repayments, and you could be stuck with nothing.
Finding a place to park your emergency fund
Look for these three characteristics when searching for a place to invest the
money in your emergency fund:
✦Little or no risk
✦Easy access to the money
✦A chance to earn some money on the investment
The last thing you want to do with your emergency fund money is put it at
risk in a speculative investment. The idea behind an emergency fund is that
the money is there for you, when you really need it. So find a safe place to put
your money, a place where you can get access to the money on short notice.
Because your emergency money might be sitting idle for some time (ideally,
you won’t have any emergencies and the money can sit idle for a long time),
the money should be invested so that it earns some interest.

Book I
Chapter 4
Protecting Yourself
Creating an Emergency Fund
71
A bank savings account is risk-free and earns a little interest, although little is
the operative word. A step up from a bank savings account is a money market
fund. These funds are still completely safe, usually earn more interest than
the bank accounts, and you can find money market funds that have check-
writing privileges so that you can get your money right away if necessary.
Other totally safe investments are U.S. Treasury bills and bank certificates of
deposit. These investments pay a little more than the bank saving account,
but the problem with Treasury bills and CDs is that you lose the ability to
get the money whenever you need it. At the very least, you need to sell or
cash in the certificate or the bills, and, in some cases, you may face a
penalty or a loss if you don’t wait until the investment matures.
Other investment choices get progressively riskier. Usually, the higher return
an investment pays, the riskier it is, and when it comes to your emergency
money, that situation just won’t do. So stick to the banks and money mar-
kets. You may not earn a lot of interest, but you can always be sure that you
have access to your money.
Distinguishing real versus made-up emergencies
When you establish your emergency fund, you should also probably set up
some rules regarding how that fund is to be used. If you know you have the
emergency money available, it can been quite easy, maybe too easy, to take
money out of the fund for situations that may not really qualify as requiring
emergency spending.
Only you can decide what constitutes a financial emergency in your life, but
if you make the rules in advance, when it comes time to consider drawing
money from the emergency fund, it’ll be easier to resist using the emergency
money for an “emergency” family vacation, or a high-end “emergency” stereo
system that just went on sale.
The rules are for yourself and anyone else who has access to the fund. If you
are the only person in your family who controls the money, the rules you
create are just for you.
Make a list of all the types of situations you can think of that might require
use of emergency money. Examples might include
✦Loss of a job, either permanently or temporarily (for example, due to
a temporary disability), with not enough money available to pay the
required living expenses. Job loss is the leading reason for use of emer-
gency funds.
✦Unanticipated, large, unbudgeted expense, such as the unscheduled
need for a new car, a significant home repair, the breakdown of a fur-
nace, or major appliance.

Purchasing Insurance
72
✦A relative or really close friend gets in financial trouble and needs a
short-term loan.
✦Necessary but uninsured and unanticipated medical costs, such as psy-
chiatric care after a devastating event, or the need for modifications to
your home due to a disability.
Dealing with emergency expenses
you might not anticipate
When an emergency situation arises, particularly if there is a job loss involved,
there can be additional expenses that you didn’t count on, expenses that you
don’t normally have when you’re not in a state of emergency.
Examples of emergency expenses related to a job loss include
✦Job-hunting expenses: You might have to spend money on traveling to
interviews, creating a resume, printing, and postage. You might also
need to acquire new job-hunting clothes for your interviews.
✦Benefits: You might have to pay for certain benefits that you were
receiving from your employer, in particular health insurance and related
medical benefits.
✦Education: You might need to acquire additional skills in order to obtain
a new position.
Restocking the emergency fund cookie jar
Whenever you dip into the emergency fund, whether you deplete the entire
fund or just a portion of the money, remember to add an emergency fund
item back into your budget so that you begin restocking the fund as soon as
the emergency has passed.
At your next family budget-planning meeting (you are scheduling these regu-
larly now, right?), be sure to discuss the fact that you are using some of your
emergency fund, and after your lifestyle stabilizes, make plans to begin
rebuilding the fund.
If you have a family that includes children, discuss the existence of the emer-
gency and the need to tighten up on expenses in the family meeting. The family
meeting setting gives your children an opportunity to ask questions and gives
you an opportunity to explain how the emergency is impacting your lives and
how you expect the family to work together to get through this rough period.

you (or the other guy that you crashed into). But if you’re lucky and none of
those things happen, the insurance company just keeps the money, eventu-
ally paying your money to someone else who’s not as lucky as you are.
When you think about it, insurance is kind of weird.
Insuring your car
If you drive, you need insurance. Your state license bureau may require insur-
ance before it issues your driver’s license. Your auto insurance agent can 
tell you what your state requires in terms of the different types of coverage. 
In addition, your agent can offer advice on what amounts of coverage are
reasonable — and that may be more than the state minimum requirements —
and what those amounts cost. These are the types of auto insurance that are
generally available:
✦Basic liability insurance: If you look on your auto insurance policy,
you’ll see something like 25/50/10 as the description of how much liabil-
ity insurance you carry. Although this may sound like the instructions a
quarterback gives in the huddle, the numbers actually refer to an amount
of insurance coverage. The first number (25, which stands for $25,000) 
is the amount your policy covers for injuries and loss of wages for any
person hurt by you in an accident. The second number (50, or $50,000)
represents the total amount the policy will pay for all the people you
hurt. The final number (10, or $10,000) is the total amount your policy
pays to the person you hit for property damage.
✦Uninsured motorist insurance: Maybe it’s just me, but it seems to me
like there are more and more uninsured drivers out on the roads lately.
Maybe that’s because auto insurance costs have gotten higher, or maybe
it’s because drivers can get away with it. In my state, you have to have
auto insurance to get your driver’s license. As soon as you walk out of
the license branch with your license in hand, you can cancel your insur-
ance and seemingly nothing can be done to prevent this from happen-
ing. If you carry uninsured motorist insurance, your insurance pays for
the injuries, lost wages, and even pain and suffering that would have
been paid for if the other guy had been covered.
✦Personal injury insurance: This may be required by your state as part
of your auto insurance. This coverage is like extra medical insurance. It
covers some of the costs associated with injuries and ambulance charges
if you or your passengers are hurt in a car accident. Other insurance
that you carry might provide the same coverage, so ask your agent if
there is duplication of your other coverage. Some states require per-
sonal injury insurance; others do not.
✦Collision insurance: This type of insurance covers damage to your own
vehicle and is optional. The collision party of your insurance policy is
subject to a deductible amount, so you pay the deductible part of the
repairs and the insurance pays what’s left. You choose the amount of

Purchasing Insurance
74
deductible you want to have in your policy — the higher the deductible,
the more risk you take on yourself and the lower the cost of your
insurance.
✦Comprehensive insurance: This covers damage to your car from some-
thing other than a crash. This would include damage caused by hail or
tree branches that fall on your car, vandalism, flood water damage, and
so on. Like with collision insurance, there is a deductible that applies to
comprehensive coverage.
✦Extra coverage: This includes towing, replacement value coverage (nice
for vintage cars), high-risk driver coverage for when you or another
driver of your car has had previous moving violations (for example, tick-
ets for speeding, running red lights, or other accidents).
Shop around. Auto insurance rates vary from company to company, so com-
pare rates and don’t be hesitant to change insurers if you get a better deal
elsewhere.
Insuring your home and other possessions
If you own a home and have a mortgage, the lender requires that you carry
homeowner’s insurance. This protects the lender’s investment in your prop-
erty. After you’ve paid off your mortgage, the decision to have homeowner’s
insurance is not so much one of necessity as it is a common-sense decision.
Homeowner’s insurance covers damage to the home, theft, and liability for
injuries caused to others in your home or on your property. Often specific
types of damage such as damage caused by flood, hurricane, tornado, and
so on, are extras on the policy, costing more than the basic rate.
Your possessions inside the home are protected by homeowner’s insurance
as well, and if you take those possessions outside the home, they can still be
covered.
The more valuable the home and the possessions, the more expensive the
policy. Sometimes you need a separate add-on, or rider, with the home-
owner’s insurance policy to cover specific items, like expensive jewelry,
computers, musical instruments, and so on.
As with auto insurance, there is a deductible with homeowner’s insurance
that controls how much you have to pay on an insurance claim before 
the insurance company is required to make a payment. The higher the
deductible, the lower your insurance rate.
Discounts on homeowner’s insurance are available if you place fire extin-
guishers and smoke detectors in the home.

Book I
Chapter 4

Make a lot of claims against your insurance, and your premium rate increases.
Mortgage companies are picky about wanting to make sure you’re home-
owner’s insurance is up-to-date. To make sure you don’t skip town and forget
to make payments, mortgage lenders typically include an amount for insur-
ance with your monthly mortgage payment, and take care of making the pay-
ment directly to the insurer themselves.
A variation of homeowner’s insurance is renter’s insurance: It’s like home-
owner’s insurance, only for rented property. The same type of coverage
applies.
Insuring your life
OK, it’s time to talk about dying. Although this might be an uncomfortable
subject for you when you’re still very much alive, it’s easier to discuss now
than it would be, uh, later.
Life insurance stands alone as the most misunderstood type of insurance.
Some people view life insurance as a contract that gives another person incen-
tive to have you dead. Others think life insurance is designed to provide gifts
to those you leave when you die. Although these may be valid reasons for
some people to buy life insurance, they are not the most practical reasons.
The primary reason for buying life insurance should be to provide monetary
protection for someone who would suffer financially if you were to die. Most
often this refers to children or a non-working spouse. Another common life
insurance scenario occurs in the case of certain high-level corporate execu-
tives. Their company will insure them, naming the company as a beneficiary
in the event of the person’s untimely death.
We often hear the phrase “untimely death.” I’m not sure I understand what
constitutes a “timely” death, but no matter what the timing is, if you have life
insurance, there is a payout when you die.
Therefore, single people might not feel the same necessity for life insurance
that married people and particularly parents of young children do.
When considering whether or not you need life insurance, and how much 
to buy, keep in mind this list of suggestions offered by the New York State
Insurance Department as the types of expenses your life insurance proceeds
should be expected to cover:
✦Pay off debts that are in your name, including your mortgage
✦Pay for expenses that are incurred as a result of your (untimely or
timely) death, such as uninsured health care, funeral expenses, estate
taxes, legal fees pertaining to your estate

Purchasing Insurance
76
✦Provide for education and living expenses for your surviving children
✦Provide income for your surviving spouse or at least some money to
help hold over your spouse while he or she is adjusting to a new level
of income
✦Provide retirement funds for your surviving spouse
There are several types of life insurance. Here’s a rundown of the options:
✦Term life insurance: Term has no cash value while you are alive, so if
you stop paying your premiums, the policy lapses. This is the cheapest
form of life insurance, although as you get older, the rate increases.
There are also higher rates for smokers. Some companies offer a level
premium term insurance policy that lets you lock in a fixed rate for a
lengthy period of time such as 10 or 20 years. Sometimes an insurance
company offers you a discount for converting term to a different type of
life insurance policy with the same company.
Keep renewing your term policy each year and don’t let the policy lapse
until such time as you decide you don’t want term insurance at all any-
more. Many companies let you continue renewing an existing policy
without having to have a physical examination each year. If you start
and stop up again, you need to undergo another medical exam.
✦Whole life insurance: Typically considered an investment you make
over the course of your lifetime, a whole life policy offers a fixed amount
of insurance for a fixed premium, paid for as long as you live. After you
have paid a certain amount of premiums, you have an option of ceasing
your own payments and letting the earnings on the previously paid pre-
miums cover the future premiums for you. This policy has a cash value,
so if you decide you no longer want to provide for your beneficiaries,
you can cash in the policy while you’re still alive.
✦Variable life insurance: A variation on whole life wherein you get to con-
trol how the premiums you pay are invested and thus the amount of div-
idends you earn on the premiums.
✦Universal life insurance: Yet another variation on whole life insurance.
This time you have the ability not only to choose how premiums are
invested, but you can increase your premiums to increase the value of
the policy. You also have the right to borrow against your universal life
insurance policy.
✦Variable universal life insurance: What will they think of next? Universal
whole term insurance? Term variable whole insurance? The names get
pretty confusing. This particular type of policy combines all the best fea-
tures of variable and universal insurance. The policy holder controls how
much is paid in premiums, the amount of the face value of the policy, and
the way in which the money is invested. And you can borrow against the
policy.

Book I
Chapter 4

And by the way, in case you’ve lost sight of the purpose of all of these insur-
ance policies, they all pay a benefit when you die. Also, dividends earned by
the invested amounts of these insurance policies are tax-deferred until such
time as you actually receive the cash.
Insuring your health
Many employees are lucky enough to have health insurance provided by
their employer. Even if the employee has to pay for the insurance, the lower
rates that are available to groups go a long way toward making the insurance
desirable.
The cost of health insurance, if you’re not part of a company plan, can be
exorbitant. Youngsters get to piggyback on their parents’ insurance policies,
so it can be a significant financial shock when they finish school and have to
start buying their own insurance.
There are three types of health insurance: basic health, major medical, and
disability. Here’s a brief summary of each type of plan:
✦Basic health insurance: Includes both hospitalization and medical/
surgical. As the name implies, hospitalization covers hospital expenses
including the charge for the room, nursing services, the use of the oper-
ating room, medications administered by the hospital, x-rays, and lab
tests. Medical/surgical insurance takes care of the doctor bills during a
hospital stay.
✦Major medical insurance: Covers the rest of your medical costs, includ-
ing doctor visits, out-patient surgeries (although sometimes these fall
under the basic health plan), prescription drugs, private nurses, ther-
apy, and rehabilitation expenses. Usually there is a co-pay or a specific
percentage that the patient is expected to pay. Also, there is a
deductible associated with major medical, and usually there is a maxi-
mum dollar amount that the policy will cover.
✦Disability insurance: Replaces lost income when you are forced to
refrain from working for medical reasons. Disability policies differ signifi-
cantly from one provider to another, so if you’re purchasing a policy
yourself, as opposed to having a policy provided by your employer,
determine up front what features you require from the coverage, and
read the policy closely before making a decision as to which type of dis-
ability plan to purchase.
Don’t forget Medicare, the government-provided health care policy we pay
for with a portion of our earned income. Medicare is available through the
Social Security Administration to citizens over age 65 and some disabled
citizens as well.

Purchasing Insurance
78
If you’re purchasing your own health insurance, be sure to shop around. The
most important thing to consider when looking for a health insurance plan is
to decide before you start shopping what it is you’re looking for. Make a list
of the types of coverage you want to have in your plan, and the amount of
deductible you’re interested in paying. You may not end up with a plan that
is exactly what you think you want, but this gives you an excellent starting
point for analyzing and pricing plans.
Here are some other tips to think about when shopping for a health plan:
✦Ask about payments options for your insurance premiums. Some compa-
nies lower the premium rates if you agree to pay quarterly or yearly
instead of monthly.
✦Know the COBRA rules (even if you can’t remember what it stands for).
When you leave a job where you were covered by health insurance,
COBRA can be activated and give you the right to continue on the com-
pany health plan for 18 months or more. Check with your employer to
find out the rules for your company. (COBRA stands for Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, by the way.)
✦Look into the possibility of a group health plan through an organization
that you belong to (or that you might be interested in joining). Many
professional organizations offer health insurance to members at the
reduced group rates.
Insuring your future
Long-term care is the continuous skilled nursing care and custodial care nec-
essary to assist certain people with daily living activities. The people who
qualify are those who have a chronic disease, disability, or frailty. Long-term
care can last for a few months to a year, several years, or indefinitely. The care
can be provided in a nursing home, community setting, or in the home.
Don’t shy away from investigating the possibility of investing in long-term care
insurance. Analysts estimate the average annual cost to Americans in need of
long-term care as $50,000. This amount varies geographically, with care recipi-
ents in larger cities paying as much as twice that amount, and care in rural
areas not as expensive. By 2020, when the baby boom generation will be
among the ranks of the nation’s retired, the cost of long-term care is expected
to double, not only due to ongoing rising medical costs but also an anticipated
shortage of available caregivers.
If you’re in your 40s or 50s and expect to have a measurable amount of
wealth by the time you retire, long-term care insurance is something you
should consider.

Book I
Chapter 4

79
The primary alternative to long-term care insurance is Medicaid, a combined
federal and state government welfare program designed for people who can’t
afford their care costs. To qualify for Medicaid, you must first spend down
all of your assets and personal savings. This is an unattractive alternative for
people who have accumulated assets of at least two or three hundred thou-
sand dollars and would like to live comfortably or leave some of their assets
for their heirs.
If one spouse is in need of long-term care, that spouse is required to deplete
the family portfolio in order to qualify for Medicaid. This can leave the sur-
viving spouse a pauper when the first spouse dies. The undesirability of this
scenario leads many people to look into long-term care insurance.
Long-term care insurance is not prohibitively expensive if you’re in your 50s.
The problem is that many people don’t start thinking about the need for this
insurance until they’re in their 70s, at which time the cost of a policy might
make it unaffordable.

College education costs rise each year. However much college costs today,
you can be sure it will cost lots more in five or ten years or whenever you plan
to send yourself or a family member off to school. Not only does tuition rise
every year, so does the cost of housing, food, books, activity fees (required
even for inactive students), sweatshirts, basketball tickets, fraternity paddles,
and any other items that are necessary for a complete education.
Some lucky people can just write checks for the costs when it’s time to pay
for college. For the rest of us, a little advance planning is in order so that we
parents don’t end up living in a box on the street corner while our kids are
living it up on campus.
Saving the 529 way
If you’re planning on sending a family member to college any time soon (say,
in the next 25 years or so), or if you would like to contribute to someone
else’s college education, take a look at the 529 college savings plans.
The nifty little 529 programs were introduced in 1996, the year when the
members of the baby boom generation looked over their collective shoul-
ders and saw that their little boomlets were about to head for college, en
masse. Not known for their ability to plan for the future, baby boomers
turned to Congress for help and got it, albeit too late for the first wave of
baby boomer offspring, but at least in time to help those whose children
were still playing Hide and Seek and watching Nickelodeon in 1996.

How 529 plans work
Money is contributed to 529 plans on behalf of a particular beneficiary who,
one day, is expected to become a college student. The contributions can come
from anyone — parents, grandparents, family friends, or even the student
himself.
You don't get a tax deduction for the money contributed to a 529 plan, but
the money that is earned in the plan is tax-deferred. As long as the money
from the plan is used as intended, for the beneficiary's school expenses
(including room and board), the earnings in the plan are not taxed.
If it turns out the beneficiary does not go to college, or does not use all the
money in the plan, another member of the beneficiary's family may be named
as a beneficiary. Alternatively, the balance in the plan can be returned to the
person who made the contributions and the earnings are taxed to that person
when they are withdrawn.
Earnings in the 529 plan that are withdrawn and not used for education-
related costs are hit with a 10 percent penalty. However, if a child receives
scholarship money, an equivalent amount of money up to the total amount
of the scholarship money can be withdrawn from the plan and returned to
the plan contributor, and there is no penalty on that withdrawal.
All 50 states offer 529 programs; each state offers its own version(s) of the
tax-deferred savings plan. In most cases, it doesn’t matter which state you
live in or in which state your student attends or plans to attend school —
you can participate in a 529 plan from nearly any state.

A small number of states have residency restrictions for 529 plan partici-
pants. See the “Saving for college with a 529” sidebar for Web sites where
you can find out more about the rules for 529 plans in each state.
Usually the payout from the 529 plan is made directly to the school. You 
provide the bills you receive from the school to the plan sponsor, who 
cuts checks payable to the school.
Investing in 529s
Typically, each type of 529 plan offers different options for investing, some
riskier than others. Depending on the age of the beneficiary, you may want to
choose an investment plan that features long-term growth (for younger bene-
ficiaries who don’t need the money in the near future), or you can choose a
short-term program that provides less risky and more stable investing.
The 529 plans try not to invest in anything terribly risky: We’re talking about
money for a college education, not mad money you can afford to put at risk
and possibly lose. However, the possibility does exist that the fund you
choose for your 529 investment could lose money, so it’s important to moni-
tor your investment closely.
Each state invests its 529 plan money in a different mix of mutual funds.
Usually there are three or more funds from which you can choose, and you
can move your investment among the funds. Analyze the investment options
from all states, and then pick the program(s) you want to sign up for. Compare
not just the rate of return on the plans, but the administrative costs as well.
Prepaid tuition plans
Some colleges offer prepaid tuition plans. Similar to the 529 plans that are not
associated with specific educational institutions, the college tuition plans are
designed to provide an opportunity to spread school payments over a lengthy
time period. It’s in the schools’ interests to hook you early, not only to have
the use of your cash but to line up future students. Sometimes these plans
lock in a specific tuition rate if you go to that school.
The prepaid tuition plans are only tuition plans. You’re still on the hook for
room and board and other costs.
If you decide not to go to the school that offers the tuition plan, or if you are
not accepted to the school, you can still use your money at another school;
you just lose the benefit of the pre-agreed-upon tuition rate. Prepaid tuition
plans are transferable to younger siblings.

Planning for College
84
You should be fairly certain you want to send your child to that school
before choosing a prepaid tuition plan. Many plans are designed to penalize
you if you use the money for a different school. For example, you might only
get your contributions returned to you without any earnings, and you might
even have to pay a penalty.
With a prepaid tuition plan, you don’t have any choices as to how your
money is invested. What you are arranging for is a fixed rate of tuition. After
you turn your money over to the school, the school can use or invest the
money however it wants.
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts
Formerly known as the Education IRA, until someone in Washington decided
that name was way too simple and easy to remember, the Coverdell Education
Savings Account provides you with the opportunity to create a savings
account with favorable tax treatment, targeted for education costs.
Distinguishing itself from 529 plans, the ESA lets you actually save for high
school and grade school education as well as college costs in a tax-deferred/
tax-free environment. When you take money out of the ESA for school costs,
the earnings portion of the money you withdraw is tax-free. If you don’t use
the money for qualified school costs, you have to pay tax on the fund earn-
ings when they are withdrawn from the ESA.
Qualified school costs, for purposes of the Coverdell Education Savings
Accounts, means the expenses required by the school where the plan
beneficiary attends. Such expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies,
equipment, room and board, and expenses for special needs services. High
school and grammar school students get to include tutoring fees, uniforms
(if required by the school), transportation to and from school, a computer,
software (except games and fun stuff), and Internet access, home schooling,
and after-school care.
You are allowed to contribute up to $2,000 per year per beneficiary. The
Coverdell ESA contribution is not available to married taxpayers who file a
joint tax return and whose adjusted gross income on their tax return is over
$220,000, or to single taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $110,000.
The money that is contributed to the ESA must be deposited with a bank or
other financial institution that administers ESAs. The person making the con-
tributions controls how the money in the account is invested.
If the beneficiary reaches age 30 and hasn’t used all the money in the account,
the rest of the money must be withdrawn at that time.

Borrowing for college
If you decide to wait until your child is ready to start college to figure out
how to finance the college education, all is not lost. There are several types
of federal grants and loans available to parents and students who need assis-
tance in meeting college costs.
These financial aid awards are determined based on information provided by
students and parents in the annual Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) form. All of these programs are funded by the federal government
through our tax dollars.
✦Federal Pell grants: The nicest thing about a Pell grant is that you don’t
have to pay the money back. Pell grants are awarded based on need,
with an upper limit of $4,050 per school year. The maximum Pell grant
for the 2004–2005 school year is $4,050.
✦Federal work-study: Students who participate in the federal work-study
program receive wages, just like any employee, for jobs on or near their
college campus. The federal government reimburses the employer for
50 percent to 100 percent of the wages (a 75 percent reimbursement is
most common).
✦Federal Perkins loan: Jointly funded between colleges and the federal
government, Perkins loans are awarded to qualifying college students
who receive a low interest loan of up to $4,000 per year for undergradu-
ate study or $6,000 per year for graduate study.
✦Federal Stafford loan: These loans have higher interest rates and lower
award amounts than the Perkins loans. Subsidized Stafford loans, like
Perkins loans, accrue interest throughout the college years, but the fed-
eral government pays the interest until the student completes the edu-
cation. Unsubsidized Stafford loans accrue interest during the time the
student is in school, and the interest is added to the principal after grad-
uation. Perkins and Stafford loans are issued in the student’s name.
✦Plus loan: Plus loans are issued to parents of college students. These
loans are unsubsidized, so interest begins accruing immediately.
These federal programs are the tip of the financial iceberg when it comes to
financing college education. There are plenty of state and community schol-
arship and grant programs available to the industrious student who seeks
out available sources of college money and does what it takes to get the
money. Many books have been published that provide information on how
to get college money, and most high school guidance departments have
reams of brochures and information about money that is available.

Using your assets to fund a college education
Many people choose to refinance their home or cash in their Individual
Retirement Accounts when it’s time to pay for college for the kids. There’s
certainly no problem with taking either of these steps if it is part of your
master financial plan. It makes sense, however, before liquidating assets 
that you might need later on in retirement, to go ahead and fill out the 
FAFSA form to see if you qualify for federal aid.
✦Home equity loans: Equity is the difference between how much your
house is worth and how much you owe on your mortgage. Banks like to
give home equity loans because the money is secured. You can borrow
against the unencumbered value of your home, increasing your monthly
mortgage payments, and the bank is protected because it holds a lien
against your house. Of course, the downside is that if you can’t make the
payments, the bank can take your house.
✦Home equity line of credit: An alternative to an outright loan against
the equity in the home is a line of credit secured by the equity. You don’t
have to take all the money at once. You just take what you need and can
draw on the balance whenever you want. You only make payments and
pay interest on the actual amount you have borrowed, not the entire
credit line.
✦Selling the family house is also an option come college time. Some par-
ents decide that when it’s time to send the kids away to college, they can
downsize to a smaller home, take out the equity that has built up in their
house over the years, and use that money to pay for college.
✦Withdrawing money from an IRA: Taking money out of an Individual
Retirement Account (IRA) before age 591⁄2 is usually a costly way to get
money because of the penalties involved, but there is an exception to
the penalty rule when it comes to using the money for college. You can
take money from an IRA to pay for tuition, books, fees, supplies, and
equipment for yourself, your spouse, your child, or your grandchild and
incur no penalty. Note that room and board are not included. Keep in
mind, however, that you do have to pay income tax on any amounts
taken from the IRA that have not been previously taxed.
Make sure the amount you take out of the IRA corresponds exactly to (or is
less than) the amount needed for the tuition and other expenses listed above.

Planning for Retirement
It’s easy to think of retirement in the abstract. Or for that matter, it’s easy not
to think of retirement at all. For those of us in the baby boom generation,
confronting retirement is not a concept with which we were raised. Our par-
ents aged in a generation where they worked at one company for most of
their lives and could count on a company pension to provide them with a
regular paycheck throughout retirement. Also, they weren’t expected to live
as long as we are, so it didn’t take as much money to fund retirement as it’s
going to from now on.
Look at it this way: If you are offered an early retirement package today from
the company where you work and are given the opportunity to retire at age
55, there’s a possibility you will live more years as a retiree than the number
of years you worked.
Do you have enough money to cover your living expenses for the next 20
years or more? It’s a scary thought, and one most people ignore.
A more likely scenario is that people will continue to work long into what
used to be thought of as retirement years. A number of studies have been
done on our country’s aging workforce, and most of them have reached the
conclusion that complete retirement is not practical.
So, while you’re considering what type of work you might want to do when
you’re not as agile as you are today, think about putting away as much money
as you can in all of the attractive retirement savings plans that are available.
You might plan on working until you take your last breath, but in case that’s
not a viable scenario, better get busy and start (or continue) saving.
Investing in 401(k) plans
Today’s most popular retirement plan, the 401(k), and its clone, the 403(b),
are employer-sponsored plans that enable you to save a percentage of 
your income in a tax-deferred investment account. As explained in Book I,
Chapter 1, 401(k) money is taxed when it is withdrawn.
Many employers offer matching contributions to encourage employees to
add to their 401(k) plans. This is like getting free money. When you add to
your retirement fund, the employer kicks in a percentage as well.
When trying to make room in your budget for contributions to a 401(k) plan,
the best way to proceed is to put as much money as you possibly can in the
fund, and have the payments taken right out of your paycheck, so that you
don’t even notice they’re missing. Payroll withdrawals are the most painless
way to invest.

Planning for Retirement
88
Unlike company pension plans that often require you to work a certain
number of years before you are entitled to take the money, the 401(k) money
is yours and you can take it with you whenever you leave your job.
Enron employees learned the hard way that putting all of their retirement
money in one investment (particular when that investment was Enron stock)
can backfire. Spread your investible retirement money over a mix of funds so
that if one fund goes bad, it won’t take all of your future income with it.
Investing in tax-deferred annuities
A tax-deferred annuity is a type of long-term retirement investment that pro-
vides a fixed payment either for a certain amount of time or for the rest of
your life. You can customize the annuity plan based on how much and for
how long you want to contribute.
An annuity isn’t an employer benefit. This is something you choose to pur-
chase on your own.
You can purchase an annuity with a lump sum, or you can arrange for peri-
odic payments, most easily made through payroll withdrawals.
Lump sum annuity purchases are a nice way to tuck away an inheritance or
monetary gift that you receive — money that isn’t part of your regular bud-
geted spending so you won’t miss it or notice its absence.
Credit card companies have gotten into the annuity act too. You can pur-
chase an annuity from a credit card company and have monthly contribu-
tions charged to your account. Easy peasy retirement planning.
Types of annuities
There are fixed-rate annuities and variable-rate annuities. You get to pick
which kind you want when you purchase an annuity.
With a variable rate annuity, you choose the way the money will be invested,
and thus have some control over how much will be available to you when
you begin withdrawing funds.
If you choose a fixed-rate annuity, where the investments are chosen by the
annuity company, and you are guaranteed a particular return on investment,
you can shop around for the best deal you can find.
Payout of annuity funds
When it’s time to take money out of your annuity, either because you pur-
chased an annuity for a fixed period of time and the annuity has matured, or

Book I
Chapter 5
Planning
for the Future
Planning for Retirement
89
because you decide you’re ready to take the money, there are some tax con-
siderations to remember.
The tax you’ll pay on withdrawing funds is the tax on the earnings that have
accumulated, not the amount you invested. Prorate the amounts you with-
draw to split the amounts between taxable and non-taxable funds.
For example: Say you invested a total of $10,000 in an annuity and it is now
worth $15,000. Two-thirds of your money ($10,000) had been previously
taxed and is not subject to income tax now. The remaining third is taxable. If
you withdraw $300 per month, $200 will be tax-free, and the other $100 is
taxed at your current income tax rate.
This is a simplified example, because as you withdraw $300 per month, the
rest of the money keeps growing and your proportion of tax-free and taxable
money alters a bit each month. Your annuity company will be glad to help
you figure out the taxable portion of your payments.
Investing in Individual Retirement Accounts
Individual Retirement Accounts come in two flavors — traditional IRAs and
Roth IRAs. Both plan types are self-administered, meaning you get to make
all the decisions about how much you invest and how the money is invested.
The most IRA money you can invest in one year is $4,000 as of 2005, plus an
additional $500 if you’re at least age 50. In 2006, the age 50+ contribution
goes to $1,000, and in 2008, the regular IRA contribution amount goes to
$5,000. Congress is always futzing with these amounts, so just ask your bank
or financial institution (the place where you park your IRA money) to give
you the latest scoop on how much you are allowed to contribute.
Like so many other retirement plans, an IRA is a tax-deferred investment, so
any earnings that accumulate in the fund do so without having to show up
on your tax return — until such time as you take the money out.
Putting money in a traditional IRA
A traditional IRA gives you the option of taking a tax deduction for your con-
tribution. You don’t have to take the deduction, but if you want to, it goes
on the front page of your federal tax return and reduces your taxable income
in the year of the deduction.
You can make an IRA contribution all the way up to the due date of your
income tax return. So if it’s April 14 and you suddenly realize you owe way
more tax than you thought you would, plan a trip to the bank on the 15th
and make an IRA contribution. Not only do you get the benefit of tucking
away extra money for retirement, you get to reduce your taxable income 
and thus your tax.

Planning for Retirement
90
There are some limitations on who gets to take the tax deduction, based on
whether you’re married, whether you have a retirement plan in place at your
job, how much money you earn, and what time zone you live in (skip that last
one, unless of course you live in Indiana, where none of us know what time
zone we live in and our clocks, not to mention our dairy cows, are in a con-
stant state of confusion). These limitations are listed in Table 1-1 of Book I,
Chapter 1.
Putting money in a Roth IRA
No tax deduction is available for contributions to a Roth IRA, yet at the same
time, the Roth may be the best investment in town. You control the way in
which the money is invested, and when it comes time to withdraw the funds,
there is no tax on the earnings. Ever.
Your annual contribution to a Roth IRA, assuming you qualify (see Table 1-2,
Book I, Chapter 1), faces the same limit as the traditional IRA annual limits
listed above.
Those IRA contribution annual limits apply to all IRA accounts combined. So
if you have a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, you can only contribute a total
of $4,000 for 2005 (plus an additional $500 if you’re older than 50).
Investing in retirement funds designed 
for the self-employed
Self-employed people whine a lot about all the tax they have to pay, and as
a self-employed person myself I can empathize. But say what you will about
the extra taxes we face, the self-employed workers have it all over the
employees when it comes to making retirement contributions.
A self-employed worker has several options for investing in tax-deferred
retirement accounts. Take a look at these examples:
✦IRAs: Just like the employees, self-employed workers can contribute to
IRA accounts up to the annual limits (same limitations as employees).
✦Individual 401(k): Designed for the self-employed, the individual 401(k)
enables a self-employed worker to set up a 401(k) plan and contribute
just like the employees do. In addition, the self-employed person can
make employer matching contributions to the plan.
✦SEP-IRA: The self-employed person can contribute a percentage of income
up to a maximum of $41,000 annually to this type of pension plan.

Book I
Chapter 5

91
Like with anything when the IRS gets involved, the rules for self-employed
retirement plans can get kind of confusing, especially in situations where the
business person has employees. Be sure to consult with a tax professional to
make sure your contributions match the IRS guidelines.
Participating in company pension plans
Company pension plans aren’t as prevalent as they used to be, but some com-
panies still offer their employees these benefits. There are two common types
of pension plans — defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. If
you’re lucky enough to have such plans available at your workplace, you
already know that you don’t have to do anything to opt into these plans, but
there are lots of rules about when you get to claim the money and how much
you will be paid.
Participating in a defined benefit plan
As you might imagine, a defined benefit plan is a pension plan that spells 
out exactly how much the employee will receive in monthly payments at 
the time of retirement.
Typically the benefit is based on the employee’s wages and how long the
employee worked for the company.
The employer makes contributions to the plan over the course of the
employee’s years with the company. There’s no individual account like there
is with a 401(k) plan: Your benefits are part of a large fund that is responsible
for paying benefits to all retired employees. It is the employer’s responsibil-
ity to contribute enough money to the pension plan to meet the plan’s com-
mitments to current and future retirees.
In order to qualify to receive the retirement benefits of the pension plan, you
must be vested in the plan. Vesting is defined by the company you work for,
but generally refers to a predetermined number of years that you are required
to work.
It’s possible to be partially vested in a company pension plan. Many compa-
nies vest employees over a number of years so that, if you were to retire from
the company before you are fully vested, you would still receive a pension —
it would just be smaller than the amount you would receive if you were
100 percent vested.
Participating in a defined contribution plan
The reverse of the defined benefit plan is the defined contribution plan. This
type of plan includes stock, profit-sharing, and fixed annual contributions

Planning for Other Big Expenses
92
made by the employer. Also, you are entitled to contribute to the plan with
tax-deferred payroll deductions.
With a defined contribution plan, a separate account is maintained for each
employee. The amount you receive when you retire is based on the value
of the investments in the account and the value of the company stock you
receive.
As with other contributory retirement plans, it is in your interest to con-
tribute as much as you are allowed to. Years from now, your retired self 
will thank you.
Planning for Other Big Expenses
Big expenses warrant room in your budget. Just as you wouldn’t wait until
the last day you work to try to figure out how to fund your retirement, you
should give some budget consideration to other big expenses so they won’t
catch you off guard.
Some of the big expenses work easily into the budget because they come with
automatic monthly payments. A house purchase, for example, is typically
paid for with a mortgage, and most cars are purchased with the help of a car
loan — more monthly payments.
But you’re on your own for some big expenses, such as these:
✦Weddings
✦Travel
✦Caring for family member
The list can continue, depending on the types of items that are important to
you. Some expenses are just too big to simply write a check for. You can turn
to credit cards, but the best way to approach the really big expenses that
you know are waiting down the road is to add them to your budget now and
start planning.
You’ll find information in Book VI about how to use Quicken to create and
monitor savings goals. When you get an early start, adding a small amount to
your monthly budget, the savings can increase and the large expenses won’t
seem so insurmountable.
And if it turns out your daughters elope, your parents stay in good health, and
you decide you’re happy at home and don’t want to travel — well, there’s no
harm in having a little extra stash to add to your retirement savings.

Setting realistic goals
One of the most difficult tasks of planning for events that won’t occur for
many years is determining how much to save and what those events are
really going to cost.
Here are some guidelines that financial analysts suggest using when planning
for the big expenses.
✦Retirement: Experts suggest that you can expect your living expenses 
in retirement to be about 30 percent lower than your living expenses
while you’re working. Analysts tell us that, on the average, men are
expected to live to about age 71, women to age 75. So do the math, 
figure out how much you spend now, what you can expect to spend at
whenever you think you will retire, and determine how much longer
you’ll live. Compare the result with the amount of retirement money you
have saved already, and figure out what that translates to in terms of a
monthly contribution starting today.
P.S.: Don’t forget to figure in Social Security with your available retire-
ment income. Or not. Only time will tell if the government’s social insur-
ance program will survive the deluge of baby boomers.
For retirement planning and planning for other large expenses, Quicken
provides little calculators that help you determine how much you need
to save. These planners are discussed in Book VI.
✦College: One point to consider as the years go by, is that the more you
make, the more you need to save for college costs. (The higher your
income, the less financial aid you qualify for.) Another point to consider
is whether you plan to send your child to a state school, an out-of-state
public school, or a private school. Start early searching for scholarships
and positioning yourself or your child so you qualify. Many civic organi-
zations offer scholarship money to children of members who volunteer.
And get those college savings into your budget. The more you save, the
more comfortable the whole process is.
✦Travel: This type of expense is much easier to determine. Collect travel
brochures, contact agencies, write away for information, and determine
to the best of your ability the exact cost of your dream vacation. Add in
money for souvenirs and some new clothes for the trip, and start saving.
The trip you long to take will taste even sweeter if you don’t have to pay
off the credit card bills for the next ten years.
✦Care for elderly relative: When dad comes to stay with you, he will
bring more than his favorite easy chair and a list of complaints. He’ll
bring Social Security, Medicare, and maybe some savings and pension
money too, so the burden won’t fall entirely on you. Nevertheless, it’s
wise to start planning for a new family member. Do some planning and
get some savings lined up for the costs you expect to incur.

Planning for Other Big Expenses
94
Paying yourself
The analysts always say, “Pay yourself first.” What they mean is, each month
when you sit down to pay the bills, start by siphoning off money for your
savings. In fact, if you really want to save money based on the out-of-sight-
out-of-mind philosophy, set up an automatic payroll deduction, move money
into savings before it ever moves through your fingers, and you’re much
more likely to leave the money where it is.
It’s a lot harder to write a check or transfer funds yourself than it is to have
your employer take care of the job for you.
So start saving, and the future will seem like less of a financial challenge and
more of a chance to pride yourself on how well you take care of your family.

what to expect: This book should enable you to stretch the boundaries of
your program and find out about lots of new ways to have fun watching your
money grow.
Getting Quicken Set Up on Your Computer
As a bit of introduction, let me just say that the version of the Quicken pro-
gram used for the descriptions and images in this book is Quicken 2006
Premier. If you have a different version of Quicken, your screens may look
slightly different from those presented here. The logic of the program, 
however, has not changed over the years, so you should be able to quickly
extrapolate the information you need to apply to your own version of the
program. This book is not meant to be version-specific, so what you dis-
cover should carry across to whatever version of Quicken you have on 
your computer.
That said, when you place your Quicken CD in the CD-ROM drive of your
computer, you should see a screen asking whether you intend to install your
Quicken for the very first time or upgrade from an earlier version (Figure 1-1).
Choose your option and click Next to proceed.
If you don’t see the installation screen when you load your CD, click the
Start➪Run➪Browse, and then locate the CD drive letter and click it. The
Quicken files appear onscreen. Click the Setup file, and then click OK to
close the Browse window. Click OK again to close the Run window.

Using Quicken for the very first time
Quicken stores your financial information in a file on your computer. Your
data file is automatically given a name, QDATA, which is sort of reminiscent
of that android guy on Star Trek, without the Q.
The data file used for storing your personal financial information is
encrypted, which means that if someone tries to open the file by himself,
without using Quicken, all he sees is weird little hieroglyphics instead of
information about how much money you have in your bank account.
Quicken walks you through the initial setup steps so that you can enter
some basic information and get ready to use the program. Just follow along,
doing what you’re told, and nobody will get hurt.
Answering personal questions
When you’re new to Quicken, you need to answer some simple questions
that identify you to the program. Fill in the blanks with basic stuff like your
name, rank, and serial number.
The makers of Quicken know that you’re going to be using Quicken to record
your most private personal information, like how much you make at your
job, how much you paid for your brother’s birthday gift, and when you got
that face lift. See the sidebar entitled “And the password is . . .” later in this
chapter for the lowdown on how to give your program a password so that no
one else can sit down at your desk and find out your secrets.

In the next setup screen (Figure 1-2), you’re asked to check boxes for what
you want to use Quicken to accomplish. I recommend checking everything;
that way, the program is ready to go with all its bells and whistles. Just
because you check a box doesn’t mean you have to use that feature later,
but it’s easier to have everything in place right from the start.
Gathering the info you need during setup
You can wait for each question, and then run around trying to collect the
stuff you need to get yourself set up in Quicken, or you can gather all of
these items in advance, and then relax at your desk while you shuffle
through your documents and answer the questions. It’s your call.
For each type of account you want to set up, click the Add Account button
on the setup screen (Figure 1-3), and then enter the information requested.
Skip any buttons you don’t want to deal with now. You can always set up
information later.

Here is a checklist of documents you’ll need for Quicken setup (just pick the
information you want to set up now):
✦Customer ID and PIN number for Quicken online banking services: You
need to request this from your bank, and it may take a couple of days. (If
you don’t want to use the online banking services, choose Manual when
asked if this account is Online or Manual.) (See Book I, Chapter 2 for a
detailed example of setting up a new bank account.)
✦Your most recent bank statement for each account you plan to set up.
✦Your bank account number and bank routing number, if you want to sign
up for the online Quicken Bill Pay service.
✦The names, amounts, and due dates of each regular payment you make.
Entering useful start-up stuff
With Quicken, you can enter as much or as little as you want when you start
using the program. The more information you enter up front, the less you
have to do later. That’s really the only difference. But setup time is a nice
time to enter basic financial information, like the name of your bank, how
much is in your checking account, which bills get paid on a regular basis,
where your savings are invested, and so on.
Figure 1-3:

Book II
Chapter 1

101
Click through the introductory screens, entering what information you have
available, saving other entries for later on, whenever you’re ready.
When you get to the screen for setting up bills, if you choose to pay bills
online, you’ll be asked to sign up for Quicken’s Bill Pay service. The first
month is free, so it can’t hurt to give it a try and see how you like it. After
that, it’s $9.95 per month (at least, that was the fee as of this writing). This
isn’t a bad price if you are used to writing a lot of checks and paying postage
for your bill payments.
But if you don’t pay a lot of bills, or if your bank gives you an online bill
paying service for free or a lesser charge, you may not think the $9.95 is
worth it. Give it a try, see what you think, and cancel later if you don’t want
to pay. Book IV, Chapter 4 covers the online bill payment service in detail.
Entering ongoing bills
If you chose the manual bill payment option instead of the online Bill Pay
service, the screen shown in Figure 1-4 pops up, asking you to check off each
of the bills you pay on a regular basis. Check all the appropriate boxes, and
then indicate how many of each type of bill you pay. Click Next when you’ve
entered everything.
Next you see a list of all the bills you indicated in the check boxes (Figure 1-5).
Enter the name of each company that you pay the bills to, and the amount
you normally pay.
Figure 1-4:
Check
boxes for
each type of
bill you pay.

Getting Quicken Set Up on Your Computer
102
If the amount varies from payment to payment, just leave the amount area
blank and you can fill it in each time you pay a bill.
Enter the frequency with which you make these payments, and then enter
the due date for the next payment of each bill. From now on, you get a
friendly reminder from Quicken to pay your bills on time. Isn’t that sweet?
Converting from earlier Quicken versions
If you’re already a Quicken user, most of this setup information is wasted on
you. All you need to do is get your Quicken files moved over to the new
version.
Indicate at the beginning of setup that you’re already a Quicken user. Then
the search begins and Quicken finds your old Quicken data file. Click OK in
the window shown in Figure 1-6, and Quicken turns your rusty old data file
into a shiny new data file, ready to use in the latest version of Quicken.
Note that an old version of your data is saved in your Quicken folder, so if
you change your mind and decide you want to go back to the old version of
Quicken, or if for some reason there’s a problem with the conversion, your
old data is safe and sound.
Switching between data files
If you need to set up another data file in Quicken, go to the File menu and
choose New, and then do all the setup stuff over again for the new file.

You don’t need to set up a new file for each different account you own. Files
most commonly go with people, so if you plan to track finances for another
person, like your parents (couples can count as one person in Quicken-land),
or a client for whom you do bookkeeping, choose File➪New and restart the
setup process.
After the new file has been created, you can easily switch between files from
the File menu. Click File and choose one of these options:
✦If both of your filenames are listed at the bottom of the File menu, click
on the name of the file you want to open, and Quicken makes the switch
for you.
✦If the name of the file you want to open doesn’t appear on the File menu,
choose Open, and then click on the filename and click OK.
Finding Your Way Around in Quicken
The easiest way to get frustrated with Quicken is to not know where to find
the tasks you want to do. This section is designed to familiarize you with
the menus, keyboard shortcuts, Quicken activity centers, and other special
features.
This is an overview, highlighting interesting and popular menu features. I
give actual examples of the menu options throughout the book when it’s
appropriate to use these features.
Navigating Quicken’s menus
Sometimes the most frustrating thing about understanding how to use a new
program is figuring out where all the features are hidden. You may know
Figure 1-6:
One click 
of the OK
button 
and the

Finding Your Way Around in Quicken

what the program is capable of doing, but that doesn’t help if you can’t find
the commands. This little intro to the Quicken menu system should help you
get over the hump in finding your way through the program.
Using the File menu
Just as you’ve seen in many other Windows programs, the left-most menu is
File, followed by Edit, with Help over on the right. Quicken is no exception 
to the rule, and if you’ve ever used a Windows program, you’ll find you’re
already pretty familiar with the items on the File menu.
All of the file management tools can be found on the File menu (Figure 1-7),
including options for starting a new data file, opening an existing file, and
finding lost files on your computer.
The File Operations choice on the File menu enables you to make copies of
your Quicken file for transfer to another computer, delete the file, or change
its name. The validation option checks the integrity of your file in case
you’ve been having problems like lost data (very rare). And there is a nifty
feature called Year-End Copy that makes a separate data file at the end of the
year with just the past year’s transactions in it. That’s a nice file to save
somewhere away from your computer in case of an emergency.
Figure 1-7:

The File menu also includes the usual backup and restore features, as well as
import and export for transferring information from one program to another.
You can choose the Passwords menu option to set password protection for
your Quicken program, or to password-protect an individual transaction.
The Printer Setup command lets you set default features for your printer,
and there are familiar commands for printing information from your
Quicken file.
Just like in most Windows programs, you can get to the menu choices with
your keyboard if you’re tired of playing with the mouse. Press the Alt key
on your keyboard and, presto! Little underlines appear under the keyboard
shortcut letters in the menu (the “F” in File, the “E” in Edit, the “S” in Tools,
and so on). Release the Alt key and type the underlined letter to see the
whole menu. Type the underlined letter in the menu choice you want, and
you’re in business.
And the password is . . .
Passwords aren’t a required part of using
Quicken, but if you need to prevent prying eyes
from seeing your confidential financial data,
you can set a password that protects your
Quicken file. Here’s how:
1. Choose File➪Passwords from the Quicken
menu.
2. Choose File from the side menu.
The Quicken File Password window
appears.
3. Enter a password of your choice in the
New Password field.
You are allowed up to 16 characters for
your password, and those characters can
include numbers and spaces in addition to
letters.
4. Confirm your password by entering it
again in the Confirm Password field.
5. Click OK.
From now on, whenever you open Quicken, you
are prompted to enter your password.
You can also use a password to prevent anyone
from changing your Quicken data. If you
choose Transaction from the side menu in step
2 above, you are prompted to enter a password
and a date. No transactions prior to the date
you enter can be changed without entering the
password.
For Ali Baba, the password was “Open
Sesame.” You can be as creative as you like
within the 16 characters allowed for your pass-
word. Passwords are case-sensitive, so a com-
bination of upper- and lowercase letters can
lend greater protection. Throwing in a few
numerals is helpful too if your goal is to thwart
others from figuring out your password. Just be
careful that you don’t enter a password so con-
fusing that you forget it yourself!
You have a fallback if you do forget your pass-
word. For a fee ($9.95 as of this printing), Intuit
can remove the password from your file.

Using the Edit menu
There’s not much new here — you’ve seen it all before. Cut, Copy, and Paste
appear in every Edit menu known to man.
Also on Quicken’s Edit menu (Figure 1-8) are Find options that enable you to
dig around in your Quicken program, looking for lost transactions, and cus-
tomize features that enable you to change the appearance of your screen.
Besides the normal find features that show up in most programs, there’s also
a useful Recategorize feature on the Find & Replace side menu that enables
you to search for all transactions in one category and change the category
on all those transactions to something else. You can, well, find more informa-
tion about the Find feature in Chapter 2 of this book.
The Account bar hangs out on the left side of your screen and shows you all
of your various accounts. Choosing Customize the Account Bar enables you
to add or remove certain items. The same goes for the Quicken toolbar with
its cute little picture icons you can click on to perform certain tasks. Don’t
just ignore the tool bar and head for the menus — put the tasks you use
most frequently on the tool bar and click away. See “Customizing Quicken”
later in this chapter for customizing techniques.

Choose Quicken Program Preferences to adjust the following types of set-
tings in your Quicken display:
✦Features that appear on your Quicken screen at startup. For example,
you can set the program so that your checking account register, your
stock portfolio, your credit card account, or any other account or fea-
ture you have established in Quicken always appears.
✦Whether you file your taxes based on the calendar year or a different
fiscal year. Most people use the calendar year. Sometimes companies get
fancy and decide they want their year to end on something other than
December 31. You have to get permission from the IRS to use a different
date for your year-end.
✦QuickFill options (see the sidebar called “Using QuickFill”).
✦Various notifications and warnings regarding events in Quicken, such as
entering duplicate check numbers.
✦Date style. You may like your dates tall and dark or short and blond.
Quicken likes them with two digits or four (in the year, that is).
Using QuickFill
If you’ve used Quicken before or if you’re a new
user who has started experimenting with the
program, you may have noticed that some-
times, when you start typing a word, Quicken
steps in and finishes typing the word for you.
This is QuickFill at work, reading your mind and
finishing your thoughts.
As soon as you start typing, QuickFill goes to
work, trying to figure out what you’re going to
type next. As soon as it knows, it finishes the
word or words.
For example, maybe you make payments to
both the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago
Transit Authority. As you start typing “C-h-i-c-
a-g-o- -T-r-,” your computer waits patiently, not
knowing which of the two you’re going to enter.
As soon as you enter an “-i-,” the program goes
to work, finishing “-bune” on your behalf.
Depending on which QuickFill options you
choose, these tasks can be taken care of auto-
matically for you:
 Change the use of the Enter key so that,
instead of moving you from one transaction
to the next, it moves you from one field to
the next within a transaction.
 Have a little drop-down (or sometimes a
drop-up) list of choices appear when you
start typing an entry.
 Automatically capitalize the first letter of
information you type.
 Provide a little button in the fields where
QuickFill is available.
 Automatically memorize transactions. With
this feature, not only does QuickFill enter
the rest of the word that you type, but it fills
in the rest of the information from the last
transaction you had with the same name.
So on that check to the Chicago Tribune,
the last amount you paid and the payment
category automatically appear the next
time you enter “Chicago Tribune.”

Finding Your Way Around in Quicken
108
✦Special features on checks. Do you like to write messages on your
checks — maybe something poetic to go with your rent payment? You
can arrange for a message box, and some other odds and ends like
having the word “Dollars” printed on your check after the amount.
✦Default ranges used in graphs. If you like to use graphs, you can futz
with the standard time period that the graphs cover.
✦Options for display of reports. Make some choices about how you want
your reports to appear, such as adding color, including descriptions, or
being able to zoom in for details behind the numbers.
The Customize Online Updates option on the Preferences side menu enables
you to make your QuickBooks information available to Quicken online serv-
ices. You can access information coordinated with Quicken online from any
computer that has Internet access.
Using the Tools menu
You can use the Tools menu (Figure 1-9) to get back to the initial setup
screens if you want to add something in setup, like a new account or some
personal information. Choose Quicken Guided Setup to add or change this
information.

The Tools menu also gets you to the major lists that you will probably use all
the time in Quicken:
✦Account List: Includes your bank accounts, your investment accounts,
your credit cards, your loans, your assets — just about everything
you’ve entered into Quicken belongs to one of these types of accounts.
The master Account List shows everything on one screen, including
account balances, so it’s a nice place to go to get a good overview of
your financial life. Find out more about accounts in Book II, Chapter 3.
✦Category List: Whenever you enter a payment or a deposit in Quicken,
you’re asked to specify in which category the transaction goes. For
example, when you pay the landlord each month, the payment is catego-
rized as Rent. The complete category list shows all of the categories
you’ve created as well as those that came with Quicken. If you don’t like
the categories Quicken gave you, you can open this list and delete the
categories you don’t want.
✦Scheduled Transaction List: When you tell Quicken to start recording
payments and deposits automatically, those are scheduled transactions.
Open this list to see everything you’ve scheduled, and make changes if
necessary. See Book IV, Chapter 4 for more information on this feature.
✦Memorized Payee List: Have you ever started typing an entry, only to
have the name filled in with a misspelling? If you entered a name in the
past and that name contained a misspelling, Quicken remembers the
name. The Memorized Payee List is where the QuickFill feature gets its
information. All names from the entries you’ve made are listed here. If
you misspelled a name when you first entered it, you can open this list,
click on the misspelled name, and click Delete to remove the name from
the list. Sorry QuickFill, no more mistakes for you.
✦Class List: Classes are ways of tagging certain transactions. Say you
enter both your and your spouse’s transactions in the same Quicken 
file, but you want to be able to say, “See, I only spent $50 on clothes last
month and you spent $500,” you can tag the transactions with a class —
his and hers. Or if you run a little business and pay all the business bills
from your personal checkbook, set up a class for the business. When it
comes time to produce reports, you can request a report that shows
only one class or that displays separate columns for each class.
The Tools menu also gets you to the alerts screen where you can ask to be
reminded that you’re about to hit the maximum on your credit card or a par-
ticular stock you’ve had your eye on is now affordable. You can ask for the
alerts to peck at you like a hungry bird by popping up in boxes on your
screen, or you can have your alerts placed in a nice little alert list that you
look at yourself when you’re interested.

Finding Your Way Around in Quicken

Your address book can be found on the Tools menu. If you keep contact
information on your computer, the Quicken Address Book can be handy. For
example, any companies or people you write checks to can be included in
your address book and their address information is then automatically added
to the check you write. Many people use other programs like Microsoft
Outlook or Act to keep track of names and addresses, so you may think the
Quicken address book is a bit of overkill. It really depends on how often you
take advantage of address information within your Quicken program.
This may sweeten the pot if you’re considering using the Quicken Address
Book. You can import addresses from another program so you don’t have to
reenter address information. Also, Quicken comes with a nifty little synchro-
nization program called Intellisync that enables you to keep your contact
information current across all of your programs that utilize this info.
There’s a little calculator on the Tools menu — this is handy for quick calcu-
lations, and the result can be easily transferred right into an amount field in
Quicken.
Using the Online menu
Not surprisingly, you can take care of all of your online business from the
Online menu (Figure 1-10). Update balances, view your online holdings, per-
form transactions with Quicken’s Bill Pay service, record or view information
relating to your Quicken credit card, click over to Quicken’s Web site, and
so on.
The Online Center, found in the middle of the Online menu, is home base for
your online business, including downloading information, transferring funds,
and creating new transactions. Monitor your online banking, credit cards,
and investments from this location, make payments, and stay constantly up-
to-date in real time.
The Online Center creeps up everywhere. You can find it on other menus
as well.
Using the Cash Flow menu
For most Quicken users, the Cash Flow menu is like the neighborhood soda
fountain — it’s where everyone wants to hang out. The Cash Flow menu,
shown in Figure 1-11, contains access to the Cash Flow Center, where all of
your bank accounts reside. You may not be able to actually sip a soda while
lurking at the Cash Flow menu, but look at these other cool things you 
can do:
✦Reconcile your bank and credit card accounts (wheee! Lots of fun!). Find
out more about reconciling your accounts in Book II, Chapter 4.

✦Write checks to anybody you please. Find out more about writing checks

✦Work on your budget — make sure you’re not writing checks to too many
people. Find out more about budgeting in Book IV, Chapter 5.
✦Use the Calendar, which enables you to view financial transactions in
monthly format.
✦Set up recurring, scheduled transactions — like paying the rent or mort-
gage each month, student loan payments, car payments, recording your
paycheck — the regular stuff that keeps happening over and over again.
Find out more about scheduling transactions in Chapter 2 of this book.
✦Get access to the Quicken Bill Pay feature. Find out more about paying
bills online in Book IV, Chapter 4.
✦Get with the times — hook up Quicken to your PDA.
Using the Investing menu
You’re probably getting the hang of this now. The Investing menu (Figure 1-12)
gives you a pass-key to the Investing Center, Quicken’s summary page for
everything investing.

✦Record all of your stock trading, mutual fund purchasing, bond

watch. Set investing goals, and create a Watch List to keep an eye on
other investments you’re considering.
✦Use the Online Research Tools to look up stocks and mutual funds to
find out more about them so you can make intelligent decisions about
investing.
✦If you participate in a 401(k) plan at work, you can track its progress
right here along with your other investments.
✦Use the Quicken Capital Gains Estimator to figure out the tax ramifica-
tions of selling an investment before you make the sale.
✦Set investing goals, and then actually turn those goals into action.
Book III gives you lots of guidance and information on tracking your invest-
ments in Quicken.
Using the Property & Debt menu
You guessed it — the Property & Debt menu, shown in Figure 1-13, leads you
to the Property & Debt Center, where you can keep track of, you guessed it,
property and debt. Property is assets you own, like your car, your house,
your boat, your Stradivarius, or even your collection of precious aggies. (Not
the kind you find in Texas — I’m referring to real aggies, the kind you shoot
with your thumb. Otherwise known as marbles for those of you who grew up
after the 1950s.) Anything worth keeping track of can be monitored in the
Property & Debt Center.
Debt refers to serious debt, like your mortgage, your car loan, or an equity
line of credit. Credit card debt appears over on the Cash Flow menu — 
long-term debt goes here.
The Loans feature in Quicken, found on the Property & Debt menu, enables
you to actually set up loan information, and Quicken keeps track of how
much of your monthly repayment goes toward principal and interest.
You can use the Quicken Home Inventory feature found on this menu to
record a complete inventory of everything in your home. The Home
Inventory is an excellent way to make your homeowner’s or renter’s insur-
ance broker happy. Find out more about keeping track of your home and
other belongings in Book 4, Chapter 3.
Quicken also provides an Emergency Records Organizer, a tool for assem-
bling all sorts of vital statistics about you and your family.

Using the Planning menu
In spite of the fact that Cash Flow gets all the attention, my personal favorite is
the Planning menu, shown in Figure 1-14. This menu contains some extremely
useful planners and calculators for figuring out how various decisions impact
your finances.
For example, you can go to the retirement planner and enter detailed infor-
mation about how much you earn, how much you owe, your regular expenses,
the value of your assets, and any current retirement income you receive or
expect to receive, such as Social Security, and the planner shows you how
much you need to accumulate for retirement and at what age you’ll be able
to retire.
In addition to the planners, there are wonderful calculators that calculate
how much it will cost you to borrow money, or how much you need to save
for college. You can plug in a few numbers and experiment with different 
scenarios. When you’ve got the information you want, you can print out a
complete payment or saving schedule, showing principal and interest and
monthly payments or contributions. I turn to these calculators all the time,
even if Quicken wouldn’t otherwise be open on my screen because they’re
so easy to use.

Go to the Planning menu when you want to set savings goals or to get tips
for finding a financial professional to help you out. You can also use the plan-
ning tools to forecast future income and to design a plan for getting yourself
out of debt.
Using the Tax menu
The Tax menu (Figure 1-15) is your gateway to the Tax Center, where you can
play with tax scenarios like whether you should file your tax return with mar-
ried filing jointly or married filing separately, estimate how much tax you’re
going to owe, determine if you need to leave the country before April 15, that
kind of thing . . .
From the Tax menu, you can set up your Quicken categories so that you
have everything you need to prepare your tax return in the spring.
There are direct links to IRS publications in the Online Tax Tools available
through the Tax menu (so if you ever have trouble going to sleep at night,
you know where to go for mind-numbing reading material). And you can go
right from Quicken to TurboTax if you want to take advantage of Intuit’s
showcase tax preparation software.

TurboTax’s Deduction Finder is available for your use, as are various estima-
tors and calculators that you can use to stay in touch with the tax side of
your finances.
Find out more about Quicken and taxes in Book V.
Using the Reports menu
For many, Quicken is all about reports. It’s one thing to enter all of your
financial transactions in Quicken, but how about getting some feedback so
you can make sense of all those numbers? That’s where reports come in.
Figure 1-16 shows the Reports menu; each major heading has a side menu
with lots of reports from which you can choose.
Quicken is very flexible in letting you design your own reports, but you may
be perfectly happy with the reports that come standard with Quicken. There
are nearly 40 standard reports to cover nearly all of your needs.
If the standard reports aren’t giving you the information you need, you can
customize the reports so that you have exactly the data want. Customizing
reports is easy, and you can save the reports you customize so that you
don’t have to re-create them every time you want the same information.

Keyboard shortcuts
Many keyboard shortcuts are available to you in Quicken: keystrokes you
can type when you feel like giving your mouse a break. You’ll see many of the
shortcuts listed on the menus — for example, look at the Cash Flow menu.
Across from Write Checks, you see Ctrl+W. All of the keyboard shortcuts for
menu commands appear like this, right on the menu.

Customizing Quicken
Making changes in the appearance of your
Quicken program is easier than you might think.
You can change the information that appears in
the Account Bar at the left side of the Quicken
screen, and you customize the icon bar so that
you see icons for the tasks you use most
frequently.
Customize the contents of the Account Bar by
clicking the Customize button on the bottom of
the bar. The Account List window appears,
showing every account you track in Quicken,
followed by a series of check boxes. Check or
uncheck the boxes to control the display of the
various accounts: 
 Checking the Hide In Quicken check box
actually hides the account so it no longer
appears on the bar and also no longer
appears in any of your reports and graphs.
The account still exists and can be
reactivated.
 Checking the Don’t Include In Totals check
box leaves the account balance visible on
the Account Bar but removes that account’s
balance from the calculation of totals.
 Checking the Remove from Bar check box
removes the account from the Account Bar.
The account is still active in your reports and
graphs and can be accessed from the
Account List, but it no longer appears on the
Account Bar.
You can also change the appearance of the
Account Bar to not display account totals. Click
the Hide Amounts button at the bottom of the bar
to remove the display of amounts. The button
changes to Show Amt. and can be clicked at any
time to reinstate the display of amounts.
Customize your toolbar by clicking the Customize
button on the bar itself. The Customize toolbar
window appears. Click on any item in the Add to
tool bar list, and then click the Add button to
move an icon for that item onto your toolbar.
Click on any item in the Current tool bar order list,
and then click the Remove button to take an icon
off of the list. Click OK to enter your changes.

Opening and Closing Quicken
Getting into Quicken is a straightforward affair. You can use the shortcut
method and open your program by double-clicking the desktop icon, or you
can enter through the front door by using the Start button, and then choos-
ing Programs➪Quicken➪Quicken 2006 (or whatever version you’re using).
Getting out of Quicken is pretty simple too, with a couple of exceptions.
First, one of the nicest characteristics of Quicken is that the program saves
as you work, so you don’t need to search around for a way to save your
transactions when you’re ready to shut down.
Another feature of Quicken is that the program likes to remind you of your
duty to back up your files, in case of some sort of computer crisis. The
Automatic Backup feature, shown in Figure 1-19, kicks in every third time
you close your Quicken program.
Backing up files always makes sense, no matter what program you use, but
with Quicken, backing up is more than merely sensible. Imagine yourself
having to re-create all of the financial data stored in your Quicken file.
Especially if you’ve been using Quicken for several years: You don’t want to
lose all that data.
Make a backup copy and put it on a CD-ROM, Zip disk, or other removable
media — somewhere other than on your computer’s hard drive.
If you don’t like being reminded about backups as frequently as every three
times you try to close the program, you can adjust the reminder setting to a
more comfortable level of repetition.
Follow these steps to adjust the frequency of your backup reminders:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Quicken Program from the menu.
The Quicken Preferences window appears (see Figure 1-20).
Figure 1-19:
You say Exit;
Quicken

 Setting up categories

 Scheduling recurring transactions
 Setting up alerts
P
robably the single most common use of Quicken is recording checks
that you write from your bank account. Whether you write checks your-
self and then transcribe the information into Quicken, or write checks
directly from Quicken, summarizing that information and then producing
reports showing details of spending habits is a frequent Quicken task. This
chapter shows you easy ways to get information into Quicken and also
demonstrates some more sophisticated techniques for teaching Quicken
how to do some of your work for you. After all, using a program that makes
your life easier is what makes computers worthwhile (that, and playing cool
solitaire games).
Working with Categories
Quicken uses categories to distinguish different types of income and spend-
ing. Rather than lumping all of your incoming cash into one category,
Income, and all of the checks you write into another category, Expenses,
Quicken separates the various types of cash in and cash out so you can see
the details of where your money comes from and where it all goes.
Each time you enter a monetary transaction in Quicken, you need to identify
which category the amount should be assigned to.
Categories already in place
When you establish your bank accounts, credit card accounts, and other
information in Quicken, standard categories are already established for you.
Choose Tools➪Category List from the menu, or press Ctrl+C to view the cat-
egory list that comes with your Quicken program. (Computer gremlins

might change your Category List keyboard command to Shift+Ctrl+C —
check the display on the Tools menu to see which keyboard command opens
your category list.)
Scroll through the list to familiarize yourself with the categories available
to you.
You can edit this standard category list, changing names, deleting, and
adding categories until the category list is more conducive to the type of
transactions you use.
Removing unwanted categories
Reduce the clutter of categories you don’t plan on using by hiding or delet-
ing categories on the list.
Check the Hide boxes next to categories you don’t want to totally delete but
don’t need to use anymore.
Select a category to delete by clicking on the category and then clicking the
Delete button. To delete more than one category at a time, hold down the
Ctrl button while you click on each category you want to delete, and then
click the Delete button.
A warning (see Figure 2-1) appears advising you that you are about to perma-
nently delete categories. Click OK to proceed.
Don’t be alarmed by the Delete Category warning. If you delete a category
and , then later decide you want to use that category, you can always create
a new category with the same name.
If you attempt to delete a category that has already been used in some trans-
actions, you have two choices. You can assign the transactions that were
previously posted to that category to a new category, or you can leave the
transactions marked as “uncategorized.” In either case, once you make your
decision, the category is deleted.

Click OK 
and the

An alternative to removing categories you don’t want is renaming categories
to a name you prefer. Click on the category you want to change, click the
Edit button, and enter the new name for this category.
Adding new categories
Now that you’ve cleaned out the categories you no longer want, you can
populate the category list with your own choices.
Click the New button. Then enter the name and any other appropriate infor-
mation in the Set Up Category window that appears (see Figure 2-2). Click
OK when you’re ready to add this category to your list.
Add new categories on-the-fly
If you forget to add some categories that you need during this initial setup
process, no matter. You can either return to the Category list, click New, and
pick up where you left off, or you can add new categories while you enter
your Quicken transactions.
To add a new category while entering information in the register (you find
out more about that in Chapter 2 of this book), just type the category you
want to use. If the category you type isn’t recognized by Quicken, the New
Category window appears (Figure 2-3).
When you click Yes, the Set Up Category window appears, and you can enter
whatever pertinent information you want about your new category.
Figure 2-2:

Working with Categories
126
Using subcategories, sub-subcategories, 
sub-sub-sub-sub . . .
When you create a new category, one of the options in the Set Up Category
window is the category type. You can choose from Income, Expense, or
Subcategory of. The Income and Expense options determine the placement
of your category on reports that Quicken produces. Also, Quicken refers to
the type of category to determine whether amounts you enter are added to
Income or included with Expenses.
The Subcategory option enables you to create a category that is subsidiary
to an existing category. For example, if you look on the standard category
list, you see Medical as an expense item. Indented underneath Medical are
Doctor and Medicine. If you have other medical categories to set up, such as
Dentist, Eye care, Orthodontics, and so on, you can create these as subcate-
gories of Medical.
You can create subcategories of subcategories. Continuing with the medical
theme, you could create subcategories under Eye Care: Eye Doctor, Glasses
and Contacts.
An alternative might be to list each family member’s name as subcategories
under the main category of Medical, and then include sub-subcategories of
Doctor, Dentist, Hospital, and so on under each family member.
Family member–related categories are particularly helpful in situations
where parents have divorced and the court requires each parent to keep
detailed records of what is spent on each child.
The subcategories you create appear indented under their main category on
the category list and also on reports.
Quicken allows you to nest subcategories up to 16 levels deep. You may
never have the need to get this detailed in your categories, but it’s nice to
know you can go there if you want.

Setting Up Your Bank Account
There’s a lengthy section in the next chapter on setting up all sorts of
accounts, including credit card accounts, 401(k) account, loan accounts, sav-
ings accounts, mutual fund accounts, and so on, but that’s for Quicken users
who have already gotten their feet wet by setting up their first bank account.
The bank account is the place to start, and if you haven’t yet set up your
bank account, you should get it done now. (You might have set up your bank
account when you went through the initial setup screens described in
Chapter 1, in which case you can take a breather and skip over these steps.)
Before you start, be sure to have a copy of your most recent bank statement
close at hand.
Begin setting up your bank account by following these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+A or choose Account List from the Tools menu.
Either way, the Account List appears on your screen. The Account List
displays all the accounts you’ve set up in Quicken. If you’re just getting
started, this list is going to be pretty barren, but soon the list will be
populated and you’ll feel like you’re really getting the hang of using your
Quicken program.
2. After the Account list is displayed, click the Add Account button or
press Alt+A to open the Quicken Account Setup window.
The Quicken Account Setup window appears. In this series of windows,
you enter all the start-up information necessary to establish your
account in Quicken.
3. Enter the name of the bank where you have your account, as shown is
Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4:
Enter the
bank where
your
account
resides.

Setting Up Your Bank Account
128
If you’re not setting up a bank account but instead a cash account or
some other type of account, check the box indicating that the account is
not held at a financial institution. Otherwise, choose your bank from the
drop-down list provided. Then click Next.
4. Indicate if you want to use online banking or manual data entry (see
Figure 2-5).
For this example, I’m using online banking. I’ve already contacted my
bank and have gotten approval to let my bank communicate with my
Quicken account. Click Next.
5. Enter your online banking user name and password.
This step only applies if you’re using the online banking feature. The
user name and password is the same access information that you use
when signing onto the bank’s Web site. Click Next to proceed. At this
point, the bank downloads all of your banking transactions for the speci-
fied account(s), for about the last month or so. All of these transactions
appear in your account register(s) in Quicken.
If you have firewall protection installed on your computer, you might be
asked to give authorization for Quicken to contact your bank. You must
authorize this connection in order to use Quicken’s online services.
When your bank starts talking to Quicken, the bank is going to spill the
beans about any other accounts that are in your name, so be prepared
to set up the rest of your accounts for online communication as well.
One of your options is to not set up this bank account in Quicken; it’s
your choice.

Entering Checks
129
6. Choose the type of account and then click Next.
Select the option that best describes your account, such as Checking,
Cash, Brokerage, and so on. Only one choice is allowed.
7. Enter a name for this account that distinguishes this account from any
other account you have set up or plan to set up.
For example, if you and your wife each have a checking account, you 
can distinguish the two accounts by name, such as Clara’s Checking 
and Joe’s Checking.
Entering Checks
If you write a lot of checks, entering them in Quicken can get tedious. On the
other hand, consider the excellent advantages of recording the checks you
write in your Quicken program. For example:
✦You can lose your checkbook and not worry about losing information
about what checks you have written.
✦More and more banks are refusing to return paper copies of cancelled
checks with monthly statements, so the check register you keep in
Quicken replaces the paper checks with a quick, permanent, and easily
sortable record of your checks.
✦Is math not your strong suit? You don’t have to worry about the num-
bers not adding up right when you record your checks in Quicken —
you’ll always have an accurate bank balance.
✦The best part of using Quicken to record your checks is that you can
produce reports showing you exactly how your money was spent.
To enter checks in Quicken, you first must set up your bank account. If you
haven’t done this yet, go back to “Setting Up Your Bank Account” earlier in
this chapter and finish the job.
When entering checks in your Quicken bank account register, you follow
much the same procedure that you would when entering a check by hand in
your checkbook register. Each piece of information that you enter provides
information that you can sort by, recall on reports, search for. The more
information you provide in the register, the easier it is to extract useful infor-
mation later.
Here’s the information you have the opportunity to enter in your checking
account register:

Entering Checks
130
✦Transaction date: Enter in mm/dd/yy format.
✦Type of transaction (identified as Num): Choose from Next Check 
Num, ATM, Deposit, Print Check, Send Online Payment, Online Transfer,
Transfer, EFT, Edit List (see the sidebar titled “Editing the type of trans-
action options” for more info).
✦Name of Payee: Quicken uses Payee as an all-encompassing term for 
the name of the party with whom you’re doing business. In the case of 
a deposit, instead of a payee, you might enter the name of a payer.
✦Amount: Amounts that decrease your account are entered in the
Payment column. Amounts that increase your account balance are
entered in the Deposit column.
✦Category: Categories are instrumental in allowing you to review your
spending later through the various reports that Quicken offers. Choosing
a category for your transaction ensures that the transaction is grouped
with other transactions in the same category.
Editing the type of transaction options
When entering a transaction in a Quicken reg-
ister, you are expected, but not required, to pro-
vide some information in the Num area of the
register that identifies the type of transaction.
If you’re entering a check, for example, the
check number goes in the Num area. For
deposits, the letters DEP go in the Num area.
Quickly enter the next check number in the
Num field by pressing either of the plus signs
on your keyboard. Alternatively, just enter the
letter N (for next), and Quicken automatically
fills in the next number.
Other options exist as well, but sometimes you
have a transaction to enter that doesn’t fit with
the choices provided by Quicken. For those
cases, you can select the Edit List option and
create new transaction identifiers, as shown in
the figure.
For example, here are some sample descrip-
tions you might want use in the Num area of
your register:
FEE: For monthly bank fees, check printing
charges, other charges assessed by the
bank
DEBIT: For items charged on your debit
card
When adding new descriptions, choose Edit
List from the drop-down menu that appears in
the Num field, and then click the Add button.
Enter the name of your description. You’re lim-
ited to nine characters, including spaces. Then
click OK and then Done.

Book II
Chapter 2
Using the Register
Entering Checks
131
✦Memo: The memo is optional. And although Quicken doesn’t permit you
to sort your register by the information in the Memo field, you can include
this memo information on reports.
✦Clr: This column is filled in automatically when you balance your regis-
ter (see Book II, Chapter 4 for more information), and the information
here reflects whether you have reconciled the amount to your financial
institution on a preliminary basis (“c”) or a permanent, reconciled basis
(“R”). You can override the entry (or lack of entry) that appears here by
clicking in the top line of the Clr column and then clicking No when
asked if you want to use Quicken’s Reconcile feature.
✦Balance: Another automatic column — Quicken keeps a running balance
in your register, so you always know how much your account contains.
Voiding checks
It’s easy to void a check in Quicken. Click on the register transaction that
you want to void, and then press Ctrl+V. Alternatively, you can right-click on
the transaction and choose Void Transaction.
Voiding is a one-step process. When you choose Void Transaction from the
pop-up menu, or when you press Ctrl+V, the transaction is immediately voided
and **VOID** is placed at the front of the Payee name for that transaction.
The amount of the transaction is changed to zero, but the transaction itself
stays in the register so later you can recall what happened.
There is no Undo option associated with voided transactions. That said, you
can always delete a voided transaction and reenter the transaction in the
register.
Splitting categories
How often do you enter a transaction that needs to be assigned to more than
one category? For example, you go to the office supply store and purchase
office supplies for your business and, at the same time, you purchase school
supplies for your children. Part of the transaction amount should be catego-
rized as business expense, and the rest goes with children or household
expenses.
When you enter a transaction that needs to be split, press Ctrl+S while enter-
ing the transaction. The Split Transaction window appears (see Figure 2-6),
providing you with an area where you can list the categories, optional memo
information, and amounts for each category that applies to the transaction
you’re entering.

Entering Checks
132
When finished entering split transaction information, click the OK button (or
press Ctrl+Enter). You’re returned to the register, and in the category infor-
mation for the current transaction, you see the following notation: --Split--.
To view how a transaction is split, double-click on the term --Split-- or press
Ctrl+S again on the split transaction, or click the little green check box that
appears in the Category field.
Having a bad mouse day? Move from one field to the next in the Split
Transaction window using your Tab key. When you’re finished making
entries, use Ctrl+Enter to close the window and return to your register.
When QuickFill is turned on, the next time you begin a transaction to this
payee, the split descriptions automatically appear. To fill in those transac-
tion amounts, press Ctrl+S to open the Split Transaction window. But if you
don’t want to use the splits, click the little X that appears to the right of the
Category field, or press Alt+X on your keyboard, and then choose Yes. Your
splits will split.
Entering your paycheck
It’s always fun getting paid, and if you really get interested in fastidious record
keeping in Quicken, you might find that you want to keep running balances
on all of the withholding amounts from your paycheck.
The quick and easy way to enter paycheck deposits is to simply enter your
employer’s name in the Payee field, enter the net amount of the check in the
Amount field, and enter Salary as the category. This won’t give you a running
balance of any of the taxes or other amounts taken out of your pay, but the
data entry is very simple.
Figure 2-6:

Book II
Chapter 2
Using the Register
Entering Checks
133
The nice thing about entering all of the withholding amounts from your pay-
check is that, after you’ve entered the withholding descriptions in the Split
Transaction window, the descriptions return each time you enter a new pay-
check, and that saves you a lot of time. If you’re salaried and receive the
same amount of pay on every paycheck, you’re going to save even more time
because QuickFill memorizes the entire paycheck, including amounts. Your
data entry is limited to entering the name of the employer and your Quicken
program will take care of everything else. You can save even more time in
entering recurring events like paychecks by telling Quicken to enter the
check for you every payday. See “Scheduling Recurring Transactions” later
in this chapter for more on this technique.
To enter a paycheck for the first time, with all of the withholding amounts,
follow these steps:
1. In your register for the account where you deposit your paychecks,
begin a new transaction with the date on which you deposited your
most recent paycheck.
Press Tab to move on to the Num column, or click in the Num column.
2. Enter D for deposit in the Num column, and then press Tab again, or
click in the Payee field.
Many people receive their paychecks as direct deposits instead of having
a hard copy of a check that needs to be taken to the bank. You can set
up your direct deposits in the same way as if you received a check.
3. Enter your employer’s name in the Payee field.
By “employer’s name” I mean the name of the company where you work,
the company that issues your checks, not the actual name of your boss
(unless your boss’s name is the same name as the company).
4. In the Deposit column, enter the amount of the check.
You’ve probably noticed that the amount you receive on your paycheck
is not the same as the amount of wages you earned. This is one of life’s
little inequities that really seems to shock people the first time they get
a job. Don’t worry. You’ll get used to it.
5. OK, here’s the fun part. You’re going to split the categories for this
check.
If there is a drop-down list showing in the Category field, great — if not,
click the little down arrow in the category field to display the drop-down
list. Then click the Split button that appears at the bottom of the list
(see Figure 2-7). A shortcut that doesn’t require the drop-down list at all
is to simply press Ctrl+S to open the Split Transaction dialog box.

Entering Checks
134
6. Enter each of the elements of your paycheck and related withholding.
Your gross wages should be recorded in total, and then list each
amount of withholding, such as Tax: Fed, Tax: Soc Sec, and so on, as
shown in Figure 2-8.
Quicken keeps a running balance for you at the bottom of the Split
Transaction window, displaying the total you entered in the register for
this check and the total detail you’ve entered in the Split Transaction
window.
If you enter all of the amounts from your check and the split transaction
detail doesn’t add up to the total, there will be a remainder showing at
the bottom of the Split Transaction window. Double-check your entries
to make sure the amounts you entered are correct. If the amounts in the
Split Transaction window are correct but the total amount you entered
for the check in the register is incorrect, click the Adjust button in the
Split Transaction window. The total amount is automatically changed to
agree to the detail you’ve entered.
7. Press Ctrl+Enter or click OK to close the Split Transaction window,
and then press Enter or Alt+T or click the Enter button to complete
the entry.

Issuing checks right from Quicken
The traditional method of writing checks by hand is quickly being replaced
by electronic alternatives. With Quicken, you can issue and print checks by
making some entries on your computer screen. Who wouldn’t rather type a
check than write one out by hand?
There is one catch. In order to print checks through Quicken, you must
acquire paper check forms. These forms are can be purchased from Intuit
and can be ordered on the www.quicken.com Web site (click Intuit
Products in the upper-right corner) or by calling 1-800-548-0289.
Taking check writing one step further, you can issue online payments and do
away with paper checks altogether. See Book II, Chapter 5, and also take a
look at Book IV, Chapter 4, which addresses Quicken’s Bill Pay service.
Even if you don’t decide to purchase blank check forms and use Quicken to
write your actual checks, you can still use this method of entering informa-
tion in your Quicken register. For some people, this process is easier than
writing directly in the register — it’s more like writing a real check and
seems more familiar.
Follow these steps to use the Quicken check-writing feature, whether you
plan to issue a real check printed from Quicken or you’re just entering check
information in your Quicken program.
1. Press Ctrl+W or choose Write Checks from the Cash Flow menu.
The Write Checks window, as shown in Figure 2-9, appears. Filling out
this window is as familiar a process as, well, writing a check by hand.
Figure 2-8:

2. Enter the bank you want to use.
Quicken has already decided which bank you’re going to use for writing
this check. If you’ve only set up one bank in Quicken, there’s no choice
to make. But if you have set up more than one bank in Quicken, make
sure the correct bank is selected, or click the drop-down arrow in the
Write Checks From field at the top of the check screen to select the bank
you want.
3. Enter the name of the payee.
When you begin entering the name of the person or company who is to
receive this check, Quicken uses its QuickFill feature and fills in the rest
of the letters. This assumes, of course, that you’ve entered this name
sometime in the past. Quicken is good at guessing, but not totally clair-
voyant, so if you’ve never entered this payee’s name before, you have to
type the whole name yourself.
4. Enter the check date.
Not to be confused with today’s date (unless of course you plan on
dating the check today), the check date should agree to the date on
which the check is to be printed.
5. Enter the amount.
You say to-may-toes, I say to-mah-toes; you enter the check amount in
numerals, Quicken writes the check amount in text. It’s all good.

6. Enter the address.
Quicken may have already taken care of this task for you. If not, and if
you want the payee’s address to appear on the check, enter the address
in the Address field. Addresses are handy to have on the check if you
want to mail the check in one of those cool little window envelopes.
You can jump-start the address by typing the apostrophe key in the
address field — do this, and presto! Quicken enters the payee’s name in
the address field.
If you want to enter detailed information about this payee, click the
Address button. The Edit Address Book Record window shown in Figure
2-10 appears, allowing you to enter several pages of information about
this payee.
7. Enter a memo. Or not.
The memo field, just like it’s counterpart on a handwritten check, is
optional. Sometimes companies want you to write your account number
in the memo field. Sometimes people put personal messages in the field.
8. Check the box for online payment.
If you want this check to be an online payment, make sure the Online
Payment box is checked. You can read more about making online pay-
ments in Book II, Chapter 5. Note that the Online Payment box does not
appear if your account is not set up for online banking.
9. Choose a category using the Category drop-down list box.
You’re almost finished, but don’t leave the check without choosing a cate-
gory so the amount can get recorded correctly. If more than one category
applies to this check, click the Split button to enter multiple categories.

10. Record the check.
Click the Record Check button to finalize this transaction. The check
gets entered in your register, and the paper copy of the check is ready to
be printed. Mission accomplished.
Printing in Quicken
Printing operations in Quicken are conducted on the File menu. Click the 
File menu, and then choose either Print Checks, an option that is always
present, or Print Something Else, an option that changes depending on what
Something Else is showing on your screen. (For example, if one of the regis-
ters is displayed onscreen, the menu choice will read Print Register.) If your
portfolio is visible, the menu reads, Print Portfolio, and so on.
When you request a print job, the Print window appears, allowing you to
select a printer, determine whether you want your printout portrait (up and
down) or landscape (sideways), indicate how many or which pages you want
to print, and show how many copies you want to print. Click Print to dis-
patch the item to your printer. Figure 2-11 shows the Print window.
Basic check printing
Printing checks in Quicken involves a little bit of setup time, but after you’ve
jumped through the hoops of setting up your check printing features, your
settings are remembered forever by Quicken and never need to be reset until
you decide to change the style of your checks.
When doing the initial setup procedure for printing checks, use blank paper
in your printer instead of check stock. That way, you can sample with differ-
ent alignments until you’re satisfied that your print is lining up the way you
want it, and you won’t waste any precious checks.

Aligning checks
You must let Quicken know what type of checks you are using as well as
the type of printer you have. Follow these steps, and your checks will print
out perfectly, with all the numbers and text in the correct areas of your
check forms.
1. Open the Check Printer Setup window.
Click the File menu, and then choose Printer Setup. Pick For Printing
Checks from the side menu. The Check Printer Setup window appears
(see Figure 2-12).
2. Choose your printer.
You may only have one printer connected to your computer, in which
case the choice is simple. But if you have multiple printers, pick the one
you want to use in the Printer field.
3. Identify the type of printer paper.
Your choices are Page-Oriented and Continuous. Page-oriented checks
are checks on separate pieces of paper, as opposed to the continuous
feed checks that are all connected together like a giant accordion.
4. Choose a check style.
Checks come in many different packages. The choices offered here are
• Standard checks: These are no-frills checks — just the check, and
nothing but the check. There are three standard checks on a page.
• Voucher checks: These are checks that come with a perforated
voucher where you can enter detailed information about the check.
The size of the voucher can be anywhere from the same size as the
check, all the way up to the voucher and the check combining to fill
Figure 2-12:
Here’s
where you
tell Quicken
what type
of checks
you use.

Entering Checks

an entire 81⁄2 by 11 inch piece of paper. Some voucher checks actually
have two vouchers — one gets sent with the check; the other stays
with you for your records.
• Wallet checks: A wallet check has a small stub on the left side of the
check. These checks typically come three to a page. When you issue
a wallet check, you send the check and keep the stub.
If you are using the latest version of Quicken, you can scroll down to see
an additional option for Wallet checks: Check 21 Image Compatible. This
option, scheduled to ultimately replace the plain old Wallet checks
option, ensures that the check qualifies for Check 21 processing, the
ultra-quick electronic processing that all banks now use.
5. Choose the placement of your check.
The Partial Page Printing Style options are only available if you picked
Page-Oriented checks instead of Continuous checks. The options show
you in little pictures how your check slides into the printer. Choose the
picture that works best with your printer.
Don’t take chances with your check paper. Cut up plain paper into check
size and experiment if you’re not sure how the printer accepts pages
smaller than standard paper size.
6. Indicate the page source for your paper.
Page source options describe where the printer looks for your check
paper. Some printers come with multiple orifices for accepting paper,
thus the array of options. If your printer has only one place for paper
input, you can leave these fields at the default Automatically Select.
7. Test the check printing.
Take your checks for a road test by clicking the Align button. If you are
working with checks that come on separate pages (“page-oriented”),
choose from full page, two checks, or one check to get to the alignment
screen (Figure 2-13) for your check size.
Figure 2-13:
Choose the
option that

When you make a selection, the little Fine Alignment window appears
(see Figure 2-14), allowing you to fine-tune the placement of text on your
checks by making vertical and horizontal adjustments to the text loca-
tion. Start by clicking Print Sample to see a sample of where your text
appears.
Hold your printed sample up to a real check to see how the text aligns,
and then enter small horizontal and vertical adjustments, printing addi-
tional samples and holding them up to real checks until you’re happy
with the placement of the text. Click OK when everything works right,
and you’re in business.
Alternatively, if you picked continuous feed checks, when you click the
Align button, you see adjustment options of Coarse and Fine. Picking
either one of these enables you to print a sample that you can hold up to
your real checks. Then use Coarse if you need to make a significant ver-
tical adjustment; otherwise, use Fine to make smaller adjustments.
The nicest thing about these alignment features is that when you’ve finally
got your checks perfectly aligned, Quicken remembers the measurements,
and you don’t have to go through this exercise again.
Printing reports
Getting ready to print reports in Quicken is much less cumbersome a job
than the preparation for printing checks. A few adjustments to customize the
report printing so that you’re happy with the results, and your reports print
just the way you want them.
Follow these steps to quickly set up your report printing options.
1. Open the setup window for reports and graphs.
Open the File menu and choose Printer Setup, and then choose For
Reports/Graphs from the side menu. The Printer Setup for Reports 
and Graphs window appears as shown in Figure 2-15.

2. Make sure the correct printer is selected.
Choose your printer from the drop-down list provided.
3. Set your margins.
It might help to print out a sample report in order to see how a report
looks with the standard 1⁄2 inch margins on each side. Then make some
adjustments so that your reports aren’t cramped and are evenly spaced
on the paper.
4. Set your fonts.
Again, it pays to print out a sample report so you can see what you have
to work with. Then click on Heading Font and Body Font to choose the
typeface, size, and style you like best. There’s no right or wrong answer
here — pick any font you want.
If you have trouble fitting all of your report information on one page, try
changing to a smaller font.
5. Choose portrait or landscape.
Click the Settings button, and then Layout tab to pick between portrait
and landscape for your standard reports. Remember, you can always go
back and change this setting if you have a report that needs more verti-
cal or horizontal space. While you’re here in the settings area, click the
Paper/Quality tab to tell Quicken where it should look for the paper you
want to use on reports. If your printer only has one paper tray, there’s
no need to make a change here.
6. Save your changes.
Click OK to get out of the settings area and save those changes, and
then give OK another click to lock in your margins and fonts. From here
on, your reports will look spiffy with their new fonts and customized
margins!

Print a register
When you print a copy of a register, you only see the date, num, payee name,
memo, amount, and whether or not the transaction has cleared the bank.
You might wonder why you would ever want to print a register. Here are a
few reasons that might be useful for you:
✦The register for your bank account is a nice cross-reference tool for
bank statements. You can print a copy of the register each month and
store it in the same place where you keep your bank statement. Then
when reviewing your statement, you can see at a glance the detail
behind all the checks and other transactions (listed only by number or,
in the case of deposits, by date on the bank statement).
✦Think beyond printing the bank account register. Quicken provides
registers for your investments and other assets. Printing a register show-
ing your investment activity for a time period is a great helper when cre-
ating your tax return. Print a register for your house showing all the
improvements you’ve made — this is very helpful when you’re getting
ready to sell the house and want to demonstrate how much money
you’ve put into fixing things up.
✦Your Quicken register can actually take the place of a handwritten
register in your checkbook. I’ve gotten so I make most of my financial
transactions online through Quicken, so there’s not much need to write
out the transactions by hand in my checkbook. And for the checks I do
write, I’ve started making carbons of them with those carbon checks you
can order in lieu of the single checks. Instead of writing entries in the
checkbook register, I just sit down at the old computer with the carbon
checks and enter everything in Quicken. If you can’t live without seeing
a hard copy of your register, just print one.
To print your register, follow these steps:
1. Display the register.
This may seem like a no-brainer, but you actually have more than one
register (one for each account, one for your portfolio, and probably
others). Without opening the register that you want to print, Quicken
doesn’t know which one to choose.
The Print command is geared to whatever is onscreen, as opposed to
always being associated with a register. When you open the File menu,
you are shown two print options: printing checks and printing whatever
is onscreen. So, if it’s a register you want to print, get that register
onscreen.

Entering Checks
144
2. Choose File➪Print Register.
I gave this step away in the Warning above. Anyway, open the File menu
and you see the option to print your register. Click it, and away you go.
For a shortcut, skip the File menu and just press Ctrl+P.
3. Enter a title for your printed register, as shown in Figure 2-16.
The Print Register window provides you with a field for entering a regis-
ter name. This name appears as a heading on the printed copy of your
register.
If you leave the Title field blank, your register prints with a generic
name. For example, if you are printing the register from a bank account,
the report is headed with the title Check Register unless you pick a dif-
ferent name.
4. Enter a date range.
By default, the date range is the complete range of the register, from the
opening balance first transaction to today. Override this date range by
entering one of your own.
5. Decide whether you want to display splits.
Check the box if you want to display the detail of split transactions. If
the box is checked, Quicken displays each of the categories to which the
transaction is split. If the box is left unchecked, the word Split appears
on the report instead of the actual category.
6. Choose printer options.
Click the Print button, and then in the Print window that appears, select
from these options:
• Choose a printer.
• Choose to export to a file that can be read by another program.
• Check the box if you want to print in color.

• Check the box if you want to print in draft mode — this lets Quicken
choose a font that speeds up printing.
• Check the box if you want to fit to one page wide — this ensures that
the report fits within the margins on one page.
• Select between portrait and landscape for the direction of your
report.
• Select the pages to print.
• Click Preview to view the report onscreen before printing. Then click
OK to print.
Finding Transactions
Quicken’s great little Find feature lets you search through your entire regis-
ter, conducting a financial scavenger hunt for buried transactions. Search for
one specific transaction, or find all transactions that meet particular criteria.
Quicken produces a report showing the results of your search.
Follow these steps to implement a search throughout your register.
1. Display a register onscreen. Or not.
If the search is to be conducted through one of your registers, bring 
that register up onscreen. Note: It doesn’t matter what appears onscreen
if you want to conduct a Quicken-wide search. For example, if you want
to see all transactions that occurred on one specific date, Quicken
searches through all registers, all entries, not just the register that is 
displayed onscreen.
2. Open the Quicken Find window.
If you’re searching within one register, click the Find button at the top
of the register. Keyboard alternatives are Ctrl+F or Alt+I. Perform any
of these actions and the Quicken Find window appears as shown in
Figure 2-17.
Figure 2-17:
Seek and ye
shall Find.

Finding Transactions
146
3. Choose the search criteria.
You can search for a particular payee, a date, a check number, an
amount, a memo, a category, a cleared status, or all of the above.
4. Select a filter.
Indicate if you want the search to retrieve items that match your request
based on an exact match, an item that starts or ends with your search
example, an amount greater than, less than, greater than or equal to,
less than or equal to, or an item that contains your request.
5. Enter your search request.
In the Find field, enter the information for which you want to search.
This information can be text or numerical.
6. Execute the search.
Click Find or Find All to begin the search. Find retrieves the next item in
your register after the point where your cursor is situated. When your
search gets to the end of the register, Quicken asks if it’s OK to start at
the beginning of the register and continue the search. Each time the Find
feature finds a match, that matching transaction is selected for you.
Click Find repeatedly to go to each of the register selections that match
your criteria.
Rather than searching one at a time, you can choose Find All and see a
report showing all transactions that match your request. Double-click on
any transaction that appears on the report to go to the original entry of
that transaction.
The universal Find
You can look beyond the register onscreen and
search through the depths of your financial data.
To do so, choose Edit➪Find and Replace➪
Find/Replace.
The Find and Replace box appears. You can
enter the same type of criteria you entered for
the register Find command. The difference is,
now Quicken searches throughout the entire
program, pulling matching transactions from
anywhere they appear. The result is a nice
window showing every transaction.
One cool thing about the Find and Replace fea-
ture is that, now that you’ve found all these
transactions, you can replace them with some-
thing else. For example, maybe you misclassified
several transactions to the wrong category. Find
the transactions you mislabeled, and then use
the Replace feature to change the category.
At the bottom of the Find and Replace window
is an option to replace a certain criteria (such
as category, date, name, and so on) with some-
thing else. Check the items in the list that
should be affected by the replace, and then
click Done. Your replacements are executed!

Scheduling Recurring Transactions

Scheduling Recurring Transactions
Having the ability to schedule recurring transactions means you never have
to worry again about missing an important payment or completing repeti-
tious tasks like entering your paycheck each pay period. Let Quicken take
the responsibility for either sending you reminders of transactions or actu-
ally processing the transactions automatically. Use Quicken’s scheduling 
feature and you’ll be amazed at how well organized you become! Here’s an
example of how to schedule a recurring rent payment:
1. In the register, click on a sample transaction that you would like to
automate.
The easiest way to create a recurring transaction is to enter the transac-
tion in the register, and then tell Quicken you want to repeat this trans-
action in the future. For this example, I’ve entered my rent payment in
Figure 2-18. Now I click anywhere on that transaction in the register.
2. Open the Create Scheduled Transaction dialog box.
Right-click on the register transaction, and then click on Schedule
Transaction on the pop-up menu that appears.
Figure 2-18:
Enter the

Scheduling Recurring Transactions

3. Verify the amount and other information.
Quicken pulls information from your transaction into the Create
Scheduled Transaction dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-19. Verify 
that the amount and payee information is correct.
4. Enter the start date.
In the Scheduling section of the dialog box, enter the date when the next
payment is due.
5. Enter reminder information.
Quicken automatically assumes you want a reminder three days in
advance of each payment due date. You can change the number of days
if necessary so that you’ll have enough advance notice so that you won’t
miss your payment.
6. Enter the frequency of the payment.
Select the frequency (I’ve chosen monthly), and enter information 
about which day of the month (or week, quarter, year — whatever
you’ve chosen) the payment should be made.
7. Enter an end date if necessary.
If you’re scheduling a loan payment or some other transaction that has a
set number of occurrences, you can enter a date on which the last trans-
action occurs. For example, if you have 12 payments left on your loan,
you can either enter the last projected payment date, or you can enter
12 in the After field. My rent payments are open-ended; there is no pro-
jected date for rent to end, so I’ve left the Ending On fields blank.

8. Click OK to save your transaction.
From now on, you get a reminder each time your payment is due.
If you’re interested in automating your payments so that you don’t even
have to write the checks, take a look at Book IV, Chapter 4 where I discuss
Quicken’s Bill Pay service.
Setting Cash Balance Alerts
When it comes to reminders, Quicken is excellent at getting your attention.
You can set notices to tell you when a payment is due, remind you of your
tax deadlines (especially useful if you file quarterly), let you know the tax
implications of selling a particular stock, and much more. In this example,
because we’re talking about registers, we set an alert to let us know when
the balance in our checking account has dropped to a certain level.
1. Open the Alerts Center window.
Choose Set Up Alerts from the Tools menu. The Alerts Center window
appears, with several options appearing on the left side of the screen.
Click any of the plus signs next to major category headings to see the
detail of alerts that are available under that category. Figure 2-20 shows
the Setup list in the Alerts Center window.
Figure 2-20:

2. Choose the type of alert you want to set.
Look over the list at the left side of the window and click once on the
type of alert you want to set. In this case, we want to set a minimum 
balance reminder on an account. If necessary, click to expand the Cash
Flow list, and then click once on Account Min. Balances. All of your
accounts appear on the right side of the window.
3. Select the account and set the alert.
Click on any account, and then enter a minimum balance for that
account. In the Remind Me At column, you can enter an amount higher
than the minimum balance. When the higher amount is reached, the
alert is triggered.
4. Choose your preferred method of notification.
Click to receive your alert notice either as text in the alert list or as a
pop-up dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-21. I prefer the pop-up box
myself. If I use the alert list, I have to open the alert list in order to see
my alerts. This seems to defeat the purpose of having the program
notify me of important issues.

you start the program. Click OK to close the alert.
If you chose to have the alert appear on your alert list instead of hammering
you over the head with a pop-up box, choose Tools➪Show All Alerts to dis-

N
ow that you know how to set up your bank checking account, it’s time
to venture into deeper waters. Although you might have purchased
Quicken in order to track your checking account activity, you can monitor
many other types of accounts in Quicken as well. The more accounts you
set up in Quicken, the more useful the program becomes to you.
Setting Up a Variety of Accounts in Quicken
You can use the basic setup premise to set up separate Quicken accounts to
keep track of your savings account, your retirement account, a mutual fund
account, credit card accounts, your house, and your mortgage and car
loans. Then you can see how all these accounts work together and are
accessible in the Quicken financial centers and the financial calendar.
The initial steps for setting up accounts in Quicken are repetitive. After you
create a couple of accounts, the process becomes familiar and you can
easily create more accounts whenever you need them.
Setting up a savings account
To set up any account, the first two steps are always the same: Press Ctrl+A
to open the Account List window, and then click Add Account to open the
Quicken Account Setup window. To continue entering information about
your savings account, choose the first option that allows you to enter infor-
mation about your financial institution (if you were setting up an account
not affiliated with a financial institution, you would choose the second
option, This Account Is Not Held at a Financial Institution). Follow these
steps to set up the account:

Setting Up a Variety of Accounts in Quicken
154
1. Enter the financial institution information.
Enter the name of the bank, credit union, savings and loan, piggy bank,
bedroom mattress, buried coffee tin, or whatever organization or con-
tainer holds the money in your savings account. If you choose a financial
institution that is on the list of banks that provide online access to
Quicken, the name appears when you start typing. When you’ve got the
name entered, click Next.
2. Choose between online and manual setup.
You can have Quicken communicate with your financial institution and
download your account information, or you can enter information your-
self, without the online access. If you choose to use online services, you
need to contact your bank (or credit union, or whatever), and sign up
for their online features. For this example, I’ve chosen manual data entry.
Sometimes there is a charge to use online banking services. When you
contact your bank, be sure to ask about any fees associated with online
services, and also ask if there are any free online services available.
Sometimes you can qualify for free services if you maintain a certain bal-
ance, open a new account, or jump through some other hoops.
3. Indicate that you are setting up a savings account.
On the next screen, you are asked to identify the type of account. As you
can see, there are plenty of account types from which to choose. Pick
Savings in the Cash Flow group and click Next.
4. Give the account a name.
Enter a name that is easy to remember, in case you add more savings
accounts later. You can identify the account by the name of the bank
(such as First Bank Savings, or Chase Savings), or by the person who’s
name is on the bank (Gail’s Savings or Minnie’s Savings), or by whatever
other name makes sense to you.
5. Enter the ending date and ending balance from your last statement for
this account.
You can skip over this if you’re using online data entry. But for those of
us relying on good old bank statements that come in the mail, be sure to
have your most recent statement available, and enter the information
requested. Click Done when all information has been entered.
A lot of people are going to ask why they should bother setting up their sav-
ings account in Quicken. They may make changes to the balance only rarely,
and when then do make a deposit or earn a little interest, they can remem-
ber how much is in the account, or close enough, without having Quicken
tell them about it.

Here are several reasons to keep track of your savings:
✦Sooner or later (like around April 15th each year), you need to know the
exact amount of interest you earned. If you track the earnings all year in
Quicken, you have the information you need at your fingertips when it’s
time to fill out your tax forms.
✦One of the reasons you’ve decided to use Quicken (I’m guessing) is to
provide a complete picture of your finances. Your savings account is
part of that picture. Even if you only maintain a modest balance in the
account, every little bit should be included in your bottom line.
✦If you bank online, you can set up your savings account for online access
as well. Not only does this enable you to download your transactions
in the account, you can also make online transfers in and out of your
savings account through Quicken. Saving money suddenly becomes very
easy!
✦For some people, adding money to their savings is something that gets
forgotten or put aside in favor of other more pressing uses for their
money. Keeping your savings account and other investment accounts
prominent in Quicken helps keep the idea of saving on the front burner
so maybe you’ll be more likely to slip a little extra cash into your savings
account.
For more information on saving money and setting actual savings goals, take
a look at Book VI.

Don’t leave it to your employer to keep track of your retirement savings.
Your employer’s interest is in providing you with a benefit. By making the
retirement account available to you, he has accomplished this task. Making
the account grow and be profitable is your job.
The best way to monitor your 401(k) (and I’m using 401(k) interchangeably
with 403(b) or any other employer-provided retirement savings account) is
to set up the account in Quicken and be as attentive to that account as you
are to your bank accounts.
Set up your 401(k) by following these steps:
1. You know the routine — press Ctrl+A to open the Account List, click
Add Account to start a new one.

2. Choose the Not a Financial Institution option.
This time you’re not going to set up a bank account, so you need to
follow a path that’s a bit different from the previous accounts you’ve set
up. Click the This Account Is Not Held at a Financial Institution option,
and then click Next to proceed.
3. Pick the type of investment.
For this example, I’m using the 401(k) option. The setup for 403(b)
accounts is exactly the same. If you have a Keogh or other type of tax-
deferred retirement account, click that instead. The steps you follow will
coincide with the steps I show here. Click the correct investment type,
and then click Next.
4. Name that account.
Time to give the account a name. Be careful here. If you’ve changed jobs,
you may have more than one retirement account. Be sure to give a name
that will distinguish this account from any other similar account you
own. Click Next when you’re ready to proceed.
5. Answer questions about the account.
As you can see in Figure 3-1, you need to provide some basic information
regarding your retirement account. Give the ending date of the most
recent statement that you have. Some retirement accounts only provide
year-end statements, so your statement may be a bit dated. Indicate
whether this account is with your current employer or if it is left over
from a previous job. Is this your account or your spouse’s? And note
whether the statement shows the detail of all of the securities you own.
Finally, click Next to continue.

6. Do you have any loans against your 401(k) account?
In case you don’t know it, you may be able to borrow against your
401(k) account. If your retirement account is an IRA, it’s a different
story, but loans against the 401(k) are not particularly rare. For now,
I’m assuming there are no loans. I address the issue of 401(k) loans in
Book IV, Chapter 1.
7. Enter the ticker symbols and names of securities in your retirement
fund.
List all of the investments you hold in your retirement fund. If you don’t
know a ticker symbol, click the Ticker Symbol Lookup button for help.
Click Next when you’ve entered all of your investments.
The Ticker Symbol Lookup feature, as shown in Figure 3-2, is a service
provided by Quicken. Occasionally, I’ve had some bad luck with this fea-
ture for finding the ticker symbols of some mutual funds. Maybe the
funds I wanted are too obscure. In any case, another source you can try
for online lookup of ticker symbols for both stocks and mutual funds is
http://finance.yahoo.com/l. (Note: That last letter in the URL is
an “L,” not a “1.”)
8. Enter the total shares you own and the market value.
When you enter your ticker symbols and click Next, Quicken goes online
briefly. At this point, you’d think that Quicken is going to get the current
market value of your shares so all you have to do is enter the quantity of
shares you own and Quicken can do the math. Surprise! Quicken may be
looking up the authenticity of the securities you entered, but you still
have to enter the market value as well as the number of shares you own.
Click Next, and then Quicken gives you a summary of the total value of
each investment. Click Done and you’re finished.
Figure 3-2:
You can list
up to 10

Nowhere in the 401(k) setup were you asked to provide cost basis informa-
tion for your investments. When you finish setting up your 401(k) account, a
summary screen appears. You can click the Enter hyperlink on this screen,
or you can click the Transactions tab, and then click the Enter Cost hyperlink
to provide purchase date and cost basis information on these investments.
Entering cost basis information for your 401(k) investments may be more dif-
ficult than it sounds. If you’re like most people, you contribute to your 401(k)
with an amount withheld from each paycheck. Every contribution represents
a small purchase of each investment you hold. To track every purchase is a
monumental task, especially if you’ve owned your 401(k) for years. And
because there is no need to report the acquisition dates or the costs of each
of your investments on your tax return, you really don’t need to enter all of
this information.
For more information on tracking your 401(k) and how your 401(k) account
fits with your retirement planning, see Book VI.
Setting up a mutual fund
You’re going to be so proud of yourself for setting up your mutual fund in
Quicken. Few tax return–related tasks are as cumbersome, irritating, frus-
trating, bothersome (you get the picture) as reporting the sales of mutual
fund shares.
To set up your mutual fund account, follow these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+A to open the account list, and then click Add Account or
press Alt+A to open the Quicken Account Setup window.
2. Indicate that this account is not held at a financial institution, and
then click Next.
3. Under the Investments category, choose Single Mutual Fund.
4. Give your account a name.
If you only have one account with the mutual fund, go ahead and enter
the fund name as the name of the account. If both you and your spouse
own separate shares in the same mutual fund, I guess you’re going to
have to get personal with the names. Try distinguishing the accounts
with His and Hers, Mine and Yours, or simply use your names — Sam’s
Fidelity Account and Susan’s Fidelity Account. (This last example of
course works best if your names are actually Sam and Susan . . . feel free
to substitute other more appropriate names.) Click Next to continue.

5. Enter the ticker symbol and the number of shares you own and then
click Next.
See the tip about looking up ticker symbols earlier in this chapter. For
mutual funds with several funds in the same family (for example, there
are a mind-boggling 538 different Fidelity mutual funds), make double-
sure you get the ticker symbol correct.
Reporting sales of mutual funds on your tax return
Just stop and think about this for a minute. If
you own shares in a mutual fund, you probably
take advantage of the ability to have your
monthly earnings reinvested in more shares
instead of receiving a dividend check each
month. That sounds like such a good idea, until
you consider the tax ramifications. Each time
you purchase even a fraction of a share, that
constitutes a separate purchase of a security.
Then when you sell shares, you typically sell a
block of shares at once. Typically, people sell
mutual fund shares in rounded amounts with-
out consideration for the quantity of shares
they’ve sold. Instead, they might sell $200 worth
of shares, or $500 or $1,000. That $500 might
work out to some strange quantity like 39.382
shares, and together those shares might have
been purchased on 40 different dates.
Believe it or not, until not very many years ago,
people were required to report each share or
group or fraction of shares purchased on their
tax return when a sale occurred. Now, the IRS
allows you to average the cost of the shares
purchased instead of breaking out each indi-
vidual purchase. Easy? Yes. But does averag-
ing give you the best tax break on the shares?
Maybe not.
Your mutual fund statement probably shows
you the average cost of your shares for pur-
poses of reporting any sales on your tax return.
The alternative to using the average cost is to
report the actual cost of shares you sold. If 
you report the actual cost of shares you sold,
you’ll probably use the cost of shares in the
order in which they were purchased. So, for
example, using whole numbers only (which is
fairly uncommon for mutual funds but easy for
this example), if you own 100 shares of a mutual
fund and decide to sell 10 shares, your cost that
you show on your tax return is the cost of the
first 10 shares you purchased.
There is an alternative to reporting the cost of
the first shares you purchased. When you make
the sale, you can tell the broker exactly which
shares you want to sell. Using the same exam-
ple, those first 10 shares you purchased may
have cost much less than the most recent
shares you purchased. If you tell your broker
you want to sell the last 10 shares you pur-
chased instead of the first 10, your tax on the
sale might be quite a bit less.
You’ll never know what the possibilities are 
for calculating the tax consequences of your
mutual fund sales unless you do the math. And
Quicken is more than happy to provide you with
all the information you need, if you do the initial
legwork of entering all of your share purchases.
The great part about entering all of your mutual
fund info in Quicken is that you only have to
enter everything once, and then the information
is there forever, for every time you sell any
shares and fill out a tax return.

6. Quicken takes care of finding out the current market value online.
Click Done when you’re satisfied that all information has been entered
correctly.
7. Enter the cost basis for your shares.
If you have lots of transactions to enter, set aside plenty of time to make
your entries. If you need to, take a break and return later — you can pick up
where you left off.
Now the fun begins. Click the Cost Basis option to go to the Enter Missing
Transactions window. Enter an individual purchase like this:
1. Click the Enter Missing Transaction button.
Clicking this button triggers the Buy — Shares Bought window. Here you
can enter, one at a time, each purchase transaction, each dividend or
capital gain reinvestment, and everything else that has happened in
your account since the inception date.
2. Enter the type of transaction.
By default, Quicken has decided that you’re entering shares that were pur-
chased (see Buy — Shares Bought in the Enter Transaction drop-down
field, as shown in Figure 3-3). If you’re entering a purchase, don’t change
anything. If you’re entering a dividend reinvestment, select Reinvest —
Income Reinvested from the Enter Transaction drop-down field.
3. Enter the transaction date.
Start at the beginning, and enter the date of the first purchase or acqui-
sition of shares.
Figure 3-3:
Enter all of
the details
of a mutual

purchase.

4. Enter the number of shares acquired.
Don’t round! If you purchased 32.649 shares, don’t enter 33 shares. 
You need to record the accurate shares, down to the thousandths, as
reported on your account statements.
5. Enter the price per share in the Price Paid box.
About now you start to understand why each purchase and dividend
reinvestment has to be entered separately. Each time you acquire
mutual fund shares, you typically acquire a slightly different quantity of
shares and pay a slightly different price. The differences may seem
miniscule, but the IRS doesn’t care. When it comes time to report your
sales transactions on your tax return, you’ll need all this stuff.
6. Enter any commission that you paid.
Entries in this field are unlikely when you’re talking about a mutual fund,
unless you purchase the fund through a broker. Most people just buy
mutual funds themselves, directly from the fund, but if you buy through
a broker, you may have a commission to add here as well. Quicken takes
it from here and calculates the total cost of the shares acquired in this
transaction.
7. Finish the transaction.
Click Done or press the Enter key to complete the information. Go back
to step 1 and repeat steps 1–6 for each purchase and reinvestment, from
the beginning of time to today. Then start all over with any other mutual
funds you own and get everything entered in Quicken. And while you’re
cursing me for having you do all of this setup, give yourself a reminder
to send me a thank you note when it’s time to prepare your tax return
for a year in which you sell some mutual fund shares.
To see how to report the sales of your mutual fund shares on your tax
return, see Book V.
Setting up a credit card account
If you’re new to keeping track of credit card accounts, you may find this
whole process pretty interesting. You could just call your credit card pay-
ments a credit card expense without noting any detail of how your credit
card funds are disbursed. That would be easy, but not too helpful when
trying to set a budget and figure out where all of your money goes.
By tracking credit card spending, allocating the charges to specific spending
categories, you get an excellent sense of how you really spend your money,
which adds to providing you with a complete picture of your personal
finances.

Setting Up a Variety of Accounts in Quicken
162
Here’s how you can set up a credit card account in Quicken:
1. As usual, press Ctrl+A to open the Account List, and then Alt+A or
click Add Account to open the Quicken Account Setup window.
2. Indicate the name of the financial institution.
If your credit card is through a bank or other financial institution, enter
the name of that organization. Otherwise, choose the option for the
account not being held at a financial institution. I’ve indicated Citibank
for the financial institution in this example. Clicking Next takes you to
the next step.
3. Choose between online and manual setup.
If your financial institution is on the list of Quicken-compatible financial
institutions, you’re halfway there in terms of using online setup. Now,
look at the list that Quicken provides (see the Download Availability sec-
tion in Figure 3-4). If credit cards are on the list, you’re home-free and
have the option of selecting Online setup. If credit cards are not on the
list (as is the case in this example), you must opt for Manual setup. Click
Next when you’ve made your choice.
4. Click Credit Card as the type of account you want to set up.
Your options are many — this time we’re setting up a credit card, found
in the Cash Flow category. Click Next to move on.
5. Name your card.
Give your credit card a name that distinguishes it from any other credit
cards you plan to set up in Quicken. Marcy’s Visa won’t work if you have
more than one Visa card; likewise, simply calling your card MasterCard
Figure 3-4:

method.

won’t work if you have multiple MasterCards or hope to some day. Just
pick a name that easily identifies this card, and then click Next to
continue.
6. Enter the date and balance from your statement.
If you’ve got your most recent credit card statement handy, go ahead
and get it (I’ll wait until you get back), and then enter the ending date
and the ending balance in the fields provided. No statement? No problem.
You can skip this part and open the account in Quicken with a zero bal-
ance (if only it were that easy to wipe out your credit card balance), and
then enter information later. Clicking Next takes you to the next step.
7. Enter your credit limit. Or not.
You have an option of entering the credit limit for your card. This is an
interesting dilemma. Those left-brainy types will want to enter every little
bit of information about the credit card, including every charge ever
made, every separate finance charge, each individual payment, and of
course the credit limit too — just because they can’t resist getting picky
about the details. Others who aren’t so concerned about going back in
time to make sure they recorded that Amoco gas charge from three
years ago, might blow past this step without entering their credit limit
(and maybe they don’t even know how much the limit is). The upside to
entering the credit limit is that Quicken keeps you posted as to how
close you’re getting to the limit so you won’t go crazy and overcharge.
The downside is that Quicken keeps you posted as to how close you’re
getting to the limit, so you might think, “Well, I’ve got another $2,500 on
my credit card limit, so let’s go nuts and buy some electronic gadgets.”
So, do you want to know about the limit or don’t you? It’s your call.
8. In any case, click Done and your credit card is officially set up.
Chapter 2 in Book IV gives you the details on how to actually make this
account work for you in Quicken.
Setting up your house in Quicken
Money accounts aren’t the only types of accounts you can track in Quicken.
And you might be wondering why you should bother setting up your house
in Quicken when the tax laws have changed so that most people don’t have
to pay tax anymore when they sell their homes, nor do they even have to list
the sale on their tax return.
Here’s why: The home is probably the biggest asset you own. Therefore,
the home represents a huge chunk of your net worth (that is, your value to
anyone who might want to loan you money). Anyone who wants to know
anything about your financial worth is going to require that you provide
information about your home, including the purchase price, the cost of major
improvements you’ve made, and the amount of money you owe on the home.

Setting Up a Variety of Accounts in Quicken
164
Furthermore, although the IRS allows most people to get off scot-free when it
comes to paying tax on the sale of their home, “most” isn’t everybody, and
some people actually do have to report the sale and pay some tax. For these
people, recording the home in Quicken can be an excellent timesaver.
When I refer to your house, I’m talking about the home that you own. This
description can include a condominium, houseboat, trailer, flat, cottage, or
any other type of dwelling that you purchased and own.
You can set up your home easily in Quicken by following these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+A and then Alt+A to open the Quicken Account Setup
window.
2. Indicate that this account is not held at a financial institution, and
then click Next.
3. Select House as the type of account you are creating.
Under Property & Debt, you see the option House (with or w/o Mortgage).
Whether you owe money on your house or not, you can still set up the
account. For this example, I assume that a mortgage is owed on the
house, and, in the next section, I go over entering mortgage information.
4. Name the house.
Once again, your purpose in selecting a name is to distinguish this
account from every other account. If you own two houses, you can call
them First House and Second House, Main House and Vacation House,
Springfield House and Peoria House, or whatever terms you normally
use to tell them apart.
Tax rules associated with selling your home
As with any tax rule known to man, there 
are plenty of exceptions associated with the
requirements for paying tax on the profit from
the sale of a home, but for most people, the rule
is that you don’t have to pay tax on the sale of
your personal residence if your profit is no
more than $250,000 (or $500,000 if you’re mar-
ried and file a joint return), if you owned the
home for at least two of the past five years, and
you lived in the home for at least two of the past
five years.
For additional information, take a look at IRS
Publication 523, “Selling Your Home,” where
you can find more than 30 pages of rules and
exceptions to the rules, worksheets, phone
numbers to call where you can hear useful
recorded messages, and, buried on page 19,
the important words: “Peter and Betty Clark
married and bought a home in 1962.” Oh wait. I
mean the other important words: “Do not report
the sale of your home on your main tax return
unless . . .” You can find this valuable publica-
tion at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/

5. Provide cost and value information about your house, as shown in
Figure 3-5.
Enter the original cost of your house and the date on which you pur-
chased it. Also, you can enter a rough estimate of the value of the house
today. If you’ve had the house appraised recently, you can use the
appraisal value, or you can make a guess based on what other houses
in your neighborhood have sold for. This figure doesn’t have to be accu-
rate. If a lender or someone else wants to know the actual current value,
they can request an appraisal.
6. Indicate if there is a mortgage.
The next screen has three choices. The first choice, the one used for 
this example, is for houses that have a mortgage. Choose Yes, Create a
Liability Account for Me, and the mortgage is created and tracked in
Quicken. If you’ve previously created a mortgage loan in Quicken, the
second option is available to you, and you can select the mortgage and
link it to your house. The final option is for people who don’t owe any
money on their house or don’t want to track their mortgage in Quicken.
7. Enter the details of your mortgage loan, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Enter the original date of your existing mortgage, the amount you bor-
rowed, the number of years on the loan, and whether interest compounds
daily, monthly, or semi-annually. If your memory is a bit hazy on these
facts, make the best guess you can. You can always go back and fix any
errors later.
If you make monthly payments, choose that as the payment period. If
you pay on a different schedule, select the Other Period radio button
and enter the number of payments you normally make each year.

8. Enter mortgage payment information.
On the next screen that appears, enter information about any balloon
payment you may have with your loan, enter the amount still due on the
loan as of today, enter the amount of your payments, including interest,
but not including taxes or anything else that the bank adds in with your
payment. Enter your interest rate. Then click Done.
9. Enter more details of your mortgage payments.
The Set Up Loan Payment screen appears, and this is where you actually
set up your mortgage payments in Quicken. You are asked to provide
detailed information about other amounts included in your mortgage
payment and also information about how you normally make the pay-
ments. In the Payment area of the loan payment screen (see Figure 3-7),
click the Edit button to add any other amounts that are included with
your monthly payment (such as property tax, homeowner’s insurance,
and private mortgage insurance).

Instead of providing the detail of the additional amounts in your loan pay-
ment, you can enter one amount and call it Escrow — that’s typically how
the mortgage companies report the extra amount.
In the Transaction area of the loan payment window, enter the following
information:
✦Indicate type of payment: Indicate if this is a Payment (that is, you write
the check and record the payment yourself), Print Check (a check is gen-
erated by Quicken), or Online Pmt (payment is made electronically).
✦Click the Payment Method button to set up a scheduled payment for this
loan. See Book IV, Chapter 1 for a detailed example of how to schedule
recurring loan payments.
✦Enter the name of the payee: This is the institution or person who
receives your loan payments.
✦Enter any memo information (such as account number) that should
appear on your checks.
✦Enter the date on which the next payment is due.
✦Enter the category to which you want Quicken to add the interest por-
tion of the payment.
✦Click OK when all payment information has been entered.
In addition to the obvious necessity of making regular mortgage payments
and recording those payments in your Quicken accounts, you have other
reasons to track your mortgage through Quicken. Here are some examples:
✦The mortgage loan represents part of your net worth. When determining
how much you are worth (to a banker, at least), the loan balance figures
in as a reduction to any assets you have. If you’re using Quicken to help
provide a complete financial picture of your assets (things you own), 
liabilities (things you owe), and net worth (generally thought of as the
difference between your assets and liabilities), you must include the
mortgage loan.
✦For better or worse, including the mortgage loan with your other Quicken
accounts makes the loan seem more real, and more a part of your entire
financial picture.
✦If you track your mortgage loan payments in Quicken (which gives you
the ability to break out the interest and principal portions as well as
taxes and other amounts included in your payment), you have a basis
for comparison when you receive your year-end statements from the
bank. The year-end mortgage payment summary that your bank pro-
vides (Form 1098) is the basis for deductions on your income tax return.
Take the time to compare your actual payments to the payments
reported by the bank to make sure you are in agreement.

Using the Financial Activity Centers
168
Believe it or not, quite often there are discrepancies between the year-end
statements provided by the banks and the actual payments that people
make on their mortgages. Because payments are frequently made during the
interstice between the end of one year and the beginning of another, people
making the payments are fully entitled to rely on their own records of pay-
ments being made, even though the recipient institution may not record the
receipt of the payment and thus the related deductible interest and tax pay-
ments until the next year.
Using the Financial Activity Centers
Quicken organizes your finances into several main groups, each called an
Activity Center. You can bring up the lead screen for each Activity Center 
in Quicken and see a summary of all of the accounts you have within that
group, the balances in those accounts, alerts, transactions that are sched-
uled, graphs, and other forms of analysis. Use these financial Activity
Centers to grasp the big picture, and you can initiate transactions within
these centers right from the center overview page. Activity Centers also
include buttons to set up new accounts and hyperlinks to existing accounts.
Here is a quick summary of each of the Activity Centers, with cross-references
to other places in this book where you can find more information about using
the features of each center.
You can access the Activity Centers by clicking on the various Quicken menu
choices, and choosing the related center from the menu. For example, click
the Investing menu, and then choose Investing Center to view that center.
A faster way to move from one Activity Center to another is by clicking on
the Account Center names in the Quicken Account Bar. The Account Bar
appears on the left side of your screen (see Figure 3-8).
If your Account Bar doesn’t show up on the screen, you can make it reap-
pear by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Quicken Program➪Setup. Uncheck the
Never Display Account Bar check box and your bar should return. (Likewise,
if you prefer not to have the bar on your screen, put a check in that box, and
the Account Bar disappears.)
✦Cash Flow Center: View balances in your cash accounts and your credit
card accounts, and view transactions that are currently scheduled. Here,
you can add or edit accounts, schedule online services, pay bills, or sign
up for services like a Quicken MasterCard or online banking. Click

Assignment tool (so you can advise Quicken of which of your categories
and accounts have tax ramifications), you may find you even like work-
ing with taxes when you use the information on this page. Also you’ll
find direct links for uploading your Quicken information right into
TurboTax, Quicken’s software for preparing taxes, and there’s a little tax
calendar to remind you of when payments and tax returns are due. Find
out more about calculating your taxes in Book V.
Using Quicken’s Calendar
The Quicken Calendar has been around since early Quicken versions, and
has always been an interesting tool. Go back to the Cash Flow Center, and
look over on the right side of your screen to see the little calendar, a month
at a glance, with some days shaded in gray. You can use the little arrows
beneath the calendar to move from one month to the next. Ah, but there’s
much more to this little calendar than meets the eye.
Click on the Full Calendar link beneath the calendar (or you can choose
Calendar from the Tools menu, or simply press Ctrl+K). The calendar
appears in all its glory, in a window all by itself (see Figure 3-9). Your calen-
dar may not look very busy — especially if you’re looking at a month in
which you haven’t entered very much financial activity.

If you’ve been using Quicken for awhile, try going back to an earlier month,
one where you had a lot of activity. At first glance, you can see on the
Financial Calendar an entry for every financial transaction you entered on
each day of the month.
In Figure 3-9, you can see I’ve got my Memorized Payees list displayed on the
right side of my Calendar screen. If you don’t see this list on your Calendar
screen, click the Options button at the top of the Calendar and choose Show
Memorized Payees List.
Clicking around in the Transactions window
Here are some activities you can perform with the Financial Calendar. These
activities are available if you double-click on any day in the calendar. You see
a Transactions window appear, as shown in Figure 3-10, where you are pre-
sented with the detail for each of the transactions entered on that day.
✦Click New in the Transactions window to enter a new transaction for
that day. The New Transaction window appears. Here you choose an
account, enter a transaction type, enter all the particulars about payee,
amount, description, and category for your transaction, and enter any
schedule information for that transaction. (See also Book IV, Chapter 4
for more examples of scheduling transactions.)

✦Click New Scheduled to set up a new scheduled transaction, for example
a loan payment that needs to be split between two categories, and
made on the 10th of each month for the next 24 months. All of this infor-
mation can be entered in the Create Scheduled Transaction window that
appears.
✦Click on a specific transaction in the Transactions window, and then
click Edit to open the transaction and make changes, or click Delete to
remove the transaction, or click Register to go to that transaction where
it appears in its register. If you click on Schedule, the Create Scheduled
Transaction window appears with the details of that selected transac-
tion already filled in for you.
If you access the Register from the Financial Calendar, the calendar
seems to disappear. A Calendar button takes its place at the bottom of
your register — just click the button whenever you’re ready to return to
the Financial Calendar.
✦Already scheduled transactions appear on the calendar in Red, and if
you click on such a transaction in the Transactions window, you have
additional options to either Skip the transaction or Pay Now.
Those are the activities you can perform merely by double-clicking on a cal-
endar day to open the window for that day. There are several other interest-
ing activities you can perform with the Financial Calendar on your screen.
Setting up payments with drag-and-drop
For example, do you want to make a payment? Find the payee in the
Memorized Payees list on the right side of the Financial Calendar. Drag that
payee over to the calendar and drop it on the date on which you want to
make the payment. The New Transaction window appears, already filled in
with all of the information available for that payee. Click OK, and the pay-
ment is listed on the day you choose. Choose Online Payment in the New
Transaction window if you want the payment to be made electronically.

Chapter 4: Reconciling an Account
In This Chapter
 Advantages to balancing your accounts
 When to reconcile
 The reconciliation process
 Fixing mistakes in your Quicken register
T
here are people who make sure their checkbook balances to the penny
each month. You know who they are. They’re often the same people who
work at a clean desk, pick up after themselves, fold and put away all their
clothes, and match their socks after each load of laundry. Although I can’t
guarantee Quicken can help you with the socks, I can promise that balanc-
ing your checkbook can become a quick and easy task that you might actu-
ally enjoy.
What Is Reconciliation, Anyway?
The process of reconciliation is basically a matching game. If it’s a checking
account that you’re reconciling, you try to match the checks you wrote and
the deposits you made last month with the checks and deposits that are
listed on your bank statement. For credit card accounts, you want to match
up the charges you made (assuming you hung on to all of those elusive little
slips of paper) with the charges that the credit card company lists on your
monthly statement. Unfortunately, the amounts you enter into Quicken
during the month don’t always match the amounts that appear on the bank
statement.
The reasons for the discrepancies are not too surprising, and yet the whole
reconciliation process can get very frustrating, very quickly. Here are some
of the reasons it’s so hard to match your record or memory of transactions
with the statements:
✦Timing is a factor. You wrote some checks in February, but they don’t
show up on your bank statement until the March statement that you
receive in April. Meanwhile, your February statement, the one you’re
looking at in March, has checks on it that were written in January and
even a couple left over from December.

Knowing the Best Time to Reconcile
176
✦Memory plays tricks on you. Although you might be confident you
didn’t make any charges on your credit card in January, the credit card
statement comes in with all sorts of activity on it. If you don’t keep all of
your credit card receipts (and who does? OK, I do, but then I play with
numbers for a living), you’re going to be in for some surprises when you
get the credit card statement.
✦Sometimes the bank or creditor makes errors. Difficult as it is to
believe, the bank and the credit card company can make mistakes, and
those errors just add to the confusion when it comes time to balance the
books.
Especially in this age of identity theft, examining your monthly bank and
credit card statements with a fine-tooth comb and making sure you can 
identify every transaction as something you agreed to is more than common
sense — it’s a necessity.
Knowing the Best Time to Reconcile
Let me just say that the best time to reconcile your accounts is not when
you start bouncing checks or find that you’ve over-extended yourself on
your credit. Also, the best time to reconcile is not when you’re in a hurry to
get somewhere, when someone is waiting for you, when you’re tired and
want to go to bed, and so on.
Maybe you’re not even reconciling at all — just checking your balance regu-
larly to make sure there’s some money in your account or credit available on
the credit card — but reconciling regularly really does make sense, to con-
firm your balances, to verify that there are no errors, and to make sure no
unauthorized person is using your account.
The best time to reconcile, if you ask me, is when
✦Your statement arrives, or shortly thereafter: The longer you wait, 
the harder it is to remember transactions. If there is an error in your
account, the financial institution appreciates hearing about it as soon as
possible. And if someone has stolen your identity, you may be liable for
amounts taken from your account, and your credit record (see Book I,
Chapter 2) may take a beating before you find the problem.
✦You have time on your hands: If you don’t have enough time to devote
to balancing your accounts, save the project for later. When rushed,
people often make mistakes and just end up spending more time on the
project than necessary: time that isn’t really available to spare in the
first place.

Book II
Chapter 4
Reconciling an
Account
Working Through the Reconciliation Process
177
Working Through the Reconciliation Process
The point of reconciling is to make sure all of your deposits were recorded
by the bank and posted to your account, and that all of the checks you wrote
and other amounts you might have authorized from your account (such as
debit card charges) have cleared through your account and agree with the
amounts you recorded in your Quicken register. If the bank has stuck you
with any fees like a monthly service charge or a stop payment charge, or if
the bank has paid interest on the money in your account, the reconciliation
process records these amounts. In this way, your Quicken register always
shows you exactly how much money you actually have in your account.
The reconciliation process works for all of your bank accounts, including
checking, saving, and money markets. In addition, you can use the same
process (with a little twist on the end for making your monthly payment) to
reconcile your credit card account.
OK, your bank statement has arrived and you’ve set aside some time to
devote to the reconciliation process, so it’s time to get it done. Begin the rec-
onciliation by displaying the register for the account you want to reconcile.
Click on the account name as it appears on the Account Bar on the left side
of your Quicken screen, or press Ctrl+A to display your complete account
list and double-click on the account you plan to reconcile.
Matching the checks you wrote
The first step of reconciling your account involves matching up the checks
you wrote and entered in your Quicken register (you did enter all your
checks in the register, right?) and your ATM withdrawals and debit card
transactions with the checks and other transactions listed on your bank
statement. Here’s the play-by-play for matching your expenditures, including
tips for correcting errors and information on what to do if you forgot to
enter a transaction:
1. Open the Statement Summary window (see Figure 4-1) by clicking the
Reconcile button at the top of the register.
This window shows you the opening balance for your account, which is
the ending balance from your last bank statement. In addition, Quicken
has taken a guess at the date of your current bank statement.
If you choose to reconcile a bank account that has been set up for online
banking, you are presented with an option to reconcile online or from a
paper statement. For this example, we are reconciling from a paper
statement. Book II, Chapter 5 covers online banking and reconciliations.

Working Through the Reconciliation Process
178
2. Check the beginning balance.
Quicken goes back to your reconciliation for last month to find the
number that appears for the beginning balance. Make sure the balance
agrees with the beginning balance on your bank statement. If there’s a
difference, you can make a change to the opening balance, and Quicken
will enter an adjustment in your register to account for the difference.
It’s likely that the opening balance won’t agree with your bank statement
if this is the first time you’ve ever reconciled the account. Go ahead and
make an adjustment to the opening balance for this month. In future
months, you shouldn’t have any problems matching the balances.
If you haven’t reconciled your bank account in six months, the beginning
balance number you see in the Statement Summary window is going to
be the ending balance from your bank statement of six months ago. No
fair starting with the current month’s bank statement — you’re going to
have to go back six months and start reconciling there.
3. Entering the ending balance from your bank statement.
The ending balance you enter in the Statement Summary window should
agree exactly with the amount on your bank statement.
Here’s the techie description of how the reconciliation really works. The
ending balance provides Quicken with the information it needs to pro-
vide a running balance for your reconciliation. Quicken subtracts the
beginning balance from the ending balance and the difference is the
amount you need to explain in your reconciliation. Here’s a simple exam-
ple. Say your beginning balance on your checking account is $500 and
your ending balance is $750. Take $500 from $750 and you’re left with
$250. When you get to the reconciliation screen, you’ll see a running bal-
ance of $250. Now say you wrote three checks at $100 each and made one
deposit of $400 and one deposit of $150, and all of those transactions
Figure 4-1:
Enter details
from your
bank
statement.

Book II
Chapter 4
Reconciling an
Account
Working Through the Reconciliation Process
179
cleared your bank. When you compare your actual transactions to those
that cleared your bank, you check off each of the checks first. Each
check for $100 increases the running (reconcilable) balance by $100, so
three $100 checks makes your balance $550. Now you check off your
deposits of $400 and $150. Each deposit decreases the reconcilable bal-
ance. In this case, when you check off the deposit for $400, your balance
is down to $150 ($550 less $400). Then you check off the deposit for
$150, your running balance is zero and your account is reconciled to the
penny!
4. Enter the statement date.
The date that you enter should agree with the ending statement date on
your bank statement.
5. Enter a service charge.
If you pay a monthly fee for your bank account, enter that amount in 
the Service Charge area, along with the date on which the charge was
assessed. Usually this is the same date as the closing date of your bank
statement.
6. Tell Quicken how to categorize the service charge.
Quicken automatically adds the service charge to your register, but just
like with any other expense, you need to assign the amount to a cate-
gory. You can use a category like Bank Charge or Bank Fee, or any other
name that is appropriate for you.
7. Enter interest earned.
If your account is an interest-bearing account, enter the amount of inter-
est reported on your bank statement. If you already reported this
amount in your register, you should skip reporting it here, or Quicken
will duplicate the entry. Also enter the date on which the interest is
recorded on your statement.
8. Assign a category for interest income.
Interest earned on your account needs to be categorized as income. Be
sure to list a category such as Interest Income so your earnings are clas-
sified properly.
9. Proceed to the main reconciliation window.
Click OK in the Statement Summary window and you can view a list of all
unreconciled items in your register. Now the fun begins. Continuing the
example of reconciling a checking account, you see your checks and
payments are listed on the left side of the window, and your deposits are
on the right. These are all the checks and deposits that you entered in
your register that have yet to be marked as cleared. Be sure to also
notice the balances in the lower-right corner of the window. Now that
you know the lay of the land, you’re ready to start the matching game.

Working Through the Reconciliation Process
180
10. Match your payments to those on the bank statement.
Examine every check listed on your bank statement and find a matching
check in the Payments and Checks column on your reconciliation
window (displayed in Figure 4-2). Sound easy? Ha ha! No, I shouldn’t
laugh. How easy this job is depends on how careful you are when enter-
ing your checks in Quicken. If you meticulously enter each check you
write, each ATM withdrawal you generate, each debit card payment you
make, noting who the money was paid to and getting the amounts
exactly right, you’re going to breeze through the matching process. If, on
the other hand, you neglect to record ATMs and debit card transactions,
or if you have all thumbs for fingers and tend to hit the wrong keys when
entering amounts, this might be a chore for you.
Reconciling an account with only a handful of transactions is a piece of cake.
But when your account has dozens of transactions, and lots of mistakes, the
chore can get tedious. Don’t give up! But it’s OK to take a break. Click the
Finish Later button at the bottom of the reconciliation window and Quicken
remembers which transactions you’ve already checked off so you can pick
up where you left off when you return.
Before closing up the screen and taking a break, be sure to mark on your
bank statement where you left off as well. The paper bank statement doesn’t
have a “Finish Later” option, so it’s up to you to remember where you left off.

Matching your deposits
Money goes out; money comes in. Reconciling involves not just matching the
money you took out of your account, but also matching the money that went
in. The steps for matching your deposits are almost the same as the check-
matching steps.
You’re already in the main reconciliation window (unless you closed the
window and decided to finish the task later, in which case you need to dis-
play your register, click the Reconcile button at the top of the register, and
click OK when the statement summary appears). On the right side of the 
reconciliation window are the deposits you entered in your register. Click 
on each deposit that matches a deposit on your bank statement.
Here are some tips for matching transactions in your reconciliation window.
✦To record an exact match, click once on the transaction in the reconcili-
ation window. That places a checkmark to the left of the transaction and
changes the type to bold. You can accomplish this same task by pressing
Enter or the spacebar if the transaction is highlighted.
✦Matched the wrong transaction? No problem. Click again (or press Enter
or the spacebar again) and the checkmark and the bold type go away.
✦Numbers don’t match. You found the check on your Quicken list, but the
amount the bank statement shows for that check is different than the
amount you recorded in Quicken. First, figure out which one is right. If
you entered the check amount wrong in Quicken, click on the check
description, and then click the Edit option at the top of the list. Quicken
takes you right to the register where you can make corrections. When
finished, click Reconcile again to return to the reconciliation window
and then proceed to complete the match.
✦The bank made an error. If the bank cleared the check for the wrong
amount, this is a problem you need to sort out with the bank. Go ahead
and edit the transaction and change it to match the bank’s amount so that
you can complete the match and finish your reconciliation. Be sure to
make a note to contact the bank and get things straightened out. Any cor-
rection that the bank makes will come through as an adjustment on next
month’s bank statement and will be part of next month’s reconciliation.
✦Oops! Forgot to enter a transaction in the register! Aside from the possi-
bility that you now have less money in your account than you thought
you did, failing to record a transaction in your Quicken register does not
create a big problem. Click the New option at the top of the reconcilia-
tion window and you are magically transported back to the register.
Enter your transaction now, using the date the transaction occurred, not
today’s date, and click Reconcile to get back to work on this reconcilia-
tion. Now the transaction appears on your reconciliation list, ready for
you to check off.

Working Through the Reconciliation Process
182
Changing the way your reconciliation info is sorted
Your transaction can be sorted in one of four ways. You choose the sort method by clicking the
View button on the right side at the top of the reconciliation window (see the figure).
Here are the options you can choose from:
Sort by Check Number: Organize your transactions by check number, and this is the order you get:
In your list of checks and other expenses, items without anything entered in the check number
field appear first. Next are items with text entries (such as ATM, EFT, VISA, and so on) in the check
number field. Finally you see items with check numbers, ordered from smallest to largest number.
Meanwhile, over in the deposits column, ordering by check number puts the deposits in order by
the date on which they were entered, and then within each date they are ordered from smallest
to largest amount.
Sort by Date: All entries in both payments and deposits columns are sorted by date, from earliest
to latest. If your payments column includes items charged on your debit card, checks, electronic
transfers, ATM withdrawals — these are all sorted by date and intermingled.
Sort by Payee: Looking for a payment made to a particular person? The quickest way is to use this
alphabetical sort by payee.
Sort by Amount: This is one of my favorite sort methods. Sometimes I have an amount on my bank
statement that I simply can’t find on the reconciliation list. Maybe I entered the check number
incorrectly or I entered a transaction as a debit card transaction when it was supposed to be
entered as a check. In any case, requesting a sort by amount lets me search for the amount that
appears on my bank statement, and sometimes that’s the easiest way to track a transaction.

Book II
Chapter 4
Reconciling an
Account
Working Through the Reconciliation Process
183
✦There’s a duplicate transaction in the reconciliation list. Even with the
Quicken warning system that gives you a warning if you enter two trans-
actions with the same check number, it’s still possible to get two of the
same transactions listed in your register. You might not notice the dupli-
cation when you look at your register, but when you see the reconcilia-
tion, it’s pretty easy to see duplications. When a duplication occurs,
click on one of the duplicate entries in the reconciliation window, and
then click the Delete option at the top of the window. Click Yes to con-
firm that you really want to make the deletion, and presto! The transac-
tion disappears.
Reaching the moment of reconciliation
As you match your expenditures and your deposits, the Difference amount in
the bottom-right corner of the reconciliation screen changes. For each check
and other expense that you check off, the difference decreases. For each
deposit that you match, the difference grows. The goal of course is to get that
difference down to zero — the moment of reconciliation! — so that your regis-
ter activity exactly matches the activity recorded on your bank statement.
Unfortunately, sometimes that moment doesn’t ever seem to arrive. No
matter how hard you try to match every expense and every deposit, you’re
still out of balance. It’s up to you to decide how hard you want to work to
balance your account. If the account is out of balance by a couple hundred
dollars, it’s probably worth your time to figure out where the problem is. If
your difference is only a few cents, you might have better things to do with
your time.
Determined to balance to the penny
If you are the type who won’t quit until everything balances perfectly, here
are some pointers that might help you close in on that last penny.
✦Make sure you entered the ending bank balance correctly in your
Statement Summary. The ending balance that you entered appears at 
the bottom of the reconciliation window. If this amount is incorrect, click
the Back to Statement Summary button at the top of the reconciliation
window and correct the ending balance to match your bank statement.
✦Take the difference amount and divide it by nine. If nine divides evenly
into the difference, the problem is probably two numbers that have been
transposed. For example, say your difference is 18 cents. Probably some-
where along the line you entered a 46 instead of a 64 or a 53 instead of a
35. See how the numbers are transposed? 64–46, 53–35? And the differ-
ence between each of these pairs is 18, a multiple of nine. Nine is the
magic number for seeking out transpositions. So, if the difference is
divisible evenly by nine, you’re going to have to go back and examine 
all of your matched numbers again, looking carefully at the cents.

Working Through the Reconciliation Process
184
✦Figure out whether you’re off in your payments or your deposits. It’s not
hard to do. The reconciliation window shows a balance at the bottom of
each column — Total Payments and Total Deposits. When you’ve finished
your matching, those totals should agree to the total payments and total
deposits on your bank statement. See which total is off (with luck, only
one will be off) and you know which column contains the discrepancy.
✦Look for a transaction that exactly matches the amount of the discrep-
ancy. If your payments column is off from the bank statement’s pay-
ments by $43.00, look for a $43.00 payment in the bank statement that
you might have missed. Likewise, look for a $43.00 payment in the pay-
ments column of the reconciliation that you might not have checked off
(or that you duplicated and checked off twice).
✦Look for a deposit that should have been recorded as a payment, or 
vice versa. If you’re off by the same amount in your payments and your
deposits, probably there is a transaction that you recorded as a pay-
ment and the bank recorded as a deposit, or the other way around.
You’ve got the amount right but in the wrong column.
You can always give up and find something more fun to do
If finding a needle in a haystack isn’t your idea of a fun way to spend an
evening at the computer, you might just decide you can live with your
account being out of balance by a few nickels or dimes. Face it — if the
amount is really small, chances are the bank is right anyway. You can search
all night for that check you entered wrong, or you can just let Quicken make
an adjustment in the amount of the discrepancy and get on with your life.
If you decide to complete the reconciliation with a balance remaining in the
Difference field, go ahead and click the Finished button at the bottom of your
screen.
The Adjust Balance window as shown in Figure 4-3 appears, telling you that
the total of the transactions you matched is off from the total ending bank
balance that you entered.

Today’s date is entered in the window. If you want the reconciliation adjust-
ment created as of some other date (like if you told your wife you already
reconciled the account and you want to have the adjustment dated last
Saturday), go ahead and change the date.
Click Adjust (or Cancel if you want to go back to the reconciliation and give
it one more try), and Quicken enters an adjustment in your register, the
account balances with the bank, and all is well.
Reconciliation reports: Who needs them?
Each time you reconcile an account, Quicken gives you the opportunity to
print a reconciliation report. Personally I don’t have much use for the recon-
ciliation report, but there are some circumstances where it comes in handy:
✦The report provides a paper copy of your banking transactions. If you
like paper reports, this is a nice one to see at a glance what goes on in
your bank account. The bank account statement only shows check num-
bers and amounts — the All Transactions Detail report gives you com-
plete information. You could print a copy of the report and save it in the
same place where you file your bank statement if you want to keep that
kind of detailed records.
✦If you use Quicken for tracking your business bank account, the reconcil-
iation report provides a good paper trail of banking activity. You might
find that printing the reports and filing them in a binder for future refer-
ence is a worthwhile activity.
When you complete your reconciliation, if you request a copy of the recon-
ciliation report, you are asked to choose between two types of reports — All
Transactions and Summary and Uncleared (see Figure 4-4). The Summary
and Uncleared report simply gives totals of the quantity and amount of pay-
ments, deposits, service charges, and interest that cleared the account in
this reconciliation, and provides a total of how many and how much has
been entered in your register that has not yet cleared the bank.
The All Transactions report goes further by including not only the summary
information but also a complete detailed listing of all transactions that
cleared and did not clear the bank.

QuickBooks saves the last reconciliation report and that’s all. If you think
you might want to view a reconciliation report in the future, print it now:
When you reconcile again next month, your former reconciliation report 
will be unavailable.
What are these crazy c and R codes?
Back at the register, you might have noticed that some of your transactions
have little codes in the column marked Clr. Clr stands for Clear, and the
codes refer to whether the transactions have cleared the bank.
Although you actually can enter c’s and R’s in the Clr column if you want,
these codes are actually placed there by Quicken in its effort to keep track of
how the whole bank clearing/reconciliation effort is going:
✦c: Always appears in lowercase. Quicken has received evidence that the
item has cleared the bank, either because you checked the item off in
the reconciliation window or because you use online banking and in
one of its conversations with the bank, Quicken found out about this
transaction.
✦R: Always appears in uppercase. Not only has the item cleared the bank
and been awarded a little c, but you have completed your reconciliation.
Quicken changes the little c’s to big R’s when you finish reconciling your
account by clicking the Finish button over in the reconciliation window.
Try to delete (Ctrl+D) a transaction in your register that has been recon-
ciled, and Quicken reminds you that you are trying to delete a reconciled
transaction (see Figure 4-5). Click Yes if you are certain you want to delete
that transaction.

Deleting reconciled transactions can cause problems in future reconcilia-
tions. Understand that if you delete a transaction that has already been rec-
onciled, your reconciliation may be out of balance next month (and in future
months, until you correct the problem) by the amount of the deleted item.

S
cience fiction writers of the last century probably envisioned a super-
fast electronic worldwide economy that included a Dick Tracy–like com-
mand center on your wrist where you could execute payments and transfers
of funds and check up on your account balances from any location. Online
banking as we know it today isn’t a lot different from that made-up world of
science fiction.
If you’re new to online banking, the whole process might appear mystical
and foreign to you, just like all of computing seems to many members of our
parents’ and grandparents’ generations. Trust me, banking on your com-
puter can become just as natural to you as working with e-mail and copy
machines. After you get the hang of managing your finances from your desk,
the old-fashioned method of banking is going to rank right up there with
writing letters by hand and making copies with ditto machines. (Ah, but
didn’t those ditto copies smell wonderful?)
What’s Good (and Bad) about Online Banking?
One man’s positive is another man’s negative. The things you like might not
be the same as the things I like. This section is all about my opinion. You can
agree or not, but at least these points should give you some perspective for
deciding on the usefulness of banking online.

What’s Good (and Bad) about Online Banking?
190
What I like about online banking:
✦Convenience. There’s no question that being able to do your banking
24/7 is convenient. Whether banking at 3 in the morning is something
you would ever do or not, I don’t know. But with the schedule I keep,
banking on my time instead of on the banker’s time is worth the trouble
of setting up an online account.
✦No lines. There never are enough tellers at a bank, but so what? You
don’t need tellers in cyberspace. Unless there’s a line to get to your 
keyboard, there’s nothing to stop you from getting right to the front 
and conducting your banking transactions right away.
✦You get the whole picture. When I take care of banking, I like to see
which of my checks have cleared and which ones are still out there,
floating around. I also like to know what my balance is. I can ask the
teller at the bank these questions, but I have to ask them one at a time.
It’s easier and quicker to pull up my account register onscreen, update
the account with the latest information, and see the entire picture of all
my activity and my balance.
✦Bank from anywhere. If there’s a computer and an Internet connection,
you’re ready to access your bank information. When you set your bank
up with Quicken, you can also connect with Quicken.com and look at
your bank information from any computer, anywhere.
✦You always know your balance. If you keep a good paper bank account
register, never make any arithmetic errors, and always remember to
enter every transaction, you always know your balance. If you bank
online, you can always see your balance and you don’t have to write
anything down or add anything up.
What I don’t like about online banking:
✦Online banking is impersonal. I can remember going to the bank with
my father when I was a little girl. The bank was a huge marble structure
with big pillars outside. The teller would say hello to my father by name
and pleasantly offer assistance. Later, when I was much older, I opened
my own bank account and I too got to know the people who worked at
the bank. I was comfortable asking questions and didn’t feel rushed.
Small-town banks are still like that, or so I like to believe.
✦Some transactions just don’t work online. The truth is, we still need
bricks-and-mortar banks. No matter how cool it is to transfer money and
check balances online, there are still limits to what you can do from your
desktop. For example, if I need a roll of quarters, I have to go to the bank
(or at least somewhere other than my desk) to get them. If I want to pick
up a money order, I’m off to the bank. And I have to actually get to the

Book II
Chapter 5

191
bank during banking hours and get out of my car and go inside because
the drive-up tellers don’t like to put rolls of coins in the little canisters
and the other cars in line don’t like to wait for transactions like money
orders.
✦Security is a concern. Quicken customers have never had a problem
with identity theft from online banking, and it’s quite possible that con-
dition will remain in force forever. But with all of the paranoia about
identity theft these days, some people worry about the security of their
financial information when it is available online.
✦You may not be able to use your own bank. Although most banks have
started providing online services for their customers, some still haven’t
gotten on the bandwagon. If your own bank doesn’t communicate with
Quicken or offer its own online banking services through its Web site,
you’re out of luck. If you want those online services, you’ll have to pick a
new bank.
Online Banking and Security Issues
One of the primary concerns people have about banking online is security.
Nobody wants to give their personal financial information to strangers. And
banks that provide online services won’t be in business for long if they don’t
offer excellent security.
All banks offering online services use encryption methods that scramble 
the information you send, so that even if somehow the information were
hijacked, it would be indecipherable. Banks make a big deal about how they
use the most sophisticated form of security encryption and often compare
their level of security to that of the federal government, in case that makes
you feel more secure.
Furthermore, protection occurs at your end of the communication with your
user name and password or PIN number. If you have any concerns about
someone figuring out your password, you always have the right to change
your user name and password.
I recommend keeping track of your user names and passwords if you use the
Internet frequently and sign on with different names and passwords at differ-
ent sites. Different sites have different requirements for usernames and pass-
words (your password has to contain a numeral, use a certain number of
characters, and so on). Although I’m not prepared to publicly share informa-
tion about where I save my passwords, I do have a secret hideout where I
store login information for all the sites I use.

Online Banking and Security Issues
192
Another method of protection that banks provide their online users is auto-
matic logout. If you are banking online directly at a bank’s Web site, and your
computer screen remains idle for awhile (usually somewhere in the range of
5–10 minutes), the bank automatically logs you out and you need to sign in
again to continue working. The idea is that if you walk away from your com-
puter without logging out of the bank’s site and someone else takes your
place, that person won’t be able to perform any transactions in your bank
account.
There are additional steps you can take to ensure your privacy and security
when you use online access to your financial records:
✦Don’t share your password or PIN number with anyone. If you suspect
someone has discovered this information, change it. These codes should
be constantly in your control.
✦Don’t let anyone watch you when you sign in to an online banking ses-
sion. If you suspect someone was watching when you entered your pass-
word information, change it!
✦Don’t fall for e-mail messages asking you to update personal informa-
tion like your login name, password, account number, and so on.
Banks don’t ask for this information. You’ve already provided the bank
with the information when you signed up for the service, so any mes-
sages you get requesting this info again are probably from someone up
to no good. The bank is not going to lose your login information. If you
have any questions about an e-mail message purporting to be from your
bank, contact the bank by phone or letter to find out how to proceed.
Don’t ever send personal information in response to e-mail messages.
✦End your Quicken session when you leave your computer. Whereas
banks automatically log you out of online sessions, Quicken provides no
such protection. If there is any possibility that someone else might use
your computer, end your Quicken session and close the program.
Protecting Quicken data with a password
Perhaps the most famous password ever uttered was the one Ali Baba over-
heard when the 40 thieves chanted “Open Sesame” and opened the side of
the mountain where their treasure was held. You don’t have to chant your
Quicken password out loud, so there’s little chance of others finding out the
secret term that opens your precious treasure.
You can choose from two ways to protect your financial data in Quicken. You
can protect access to your entire Quicken file, or you can protect your trans-
actions from being changed.

Book II
Chapter 5
Introducing Online
Banking Services
Online Banking and Security Issues
193
The process is the same for setting either type of password.
1. Choose Passwords from the File menu.
A side menu appears, with options for File and Transaction. With File,
you get to prevent anyone who doesn’t know your password from open-
ing your Quicken file. Choose Transaction, and you allow access to your
file, but no one can make any changes to transactions through a particu-
lar date.
2. Choose File to provide password protection for your Quicken file.
The Quicken File Password window appears, as shown in Figure 5-1. You
are asked to enter a password. If you have previously set a password for
your Quicken file, there is a field for entering your old password. The
former password must be entered before you can change your password
to something new.
3. Enter the password you want to use.
Quicken recommends that the password be at least six characters and
contain a combination of letters and numerals. Quicken, however, accepts
any password you give it from 1 to 16 characters. Passwords are case-
sensitive, so be sure to remember if you use upper- or lowercase letters.
Click OK to save the password. The next time you open Quicken, you
must enter your password before you can have access to the program.
If, instead, you choose to set up a password for transactions instead of
the entire Quicken file, the process is nearly the same, except when you
choose Transaction from the Passwords side menu, you see the window
Figure 5-1:
If the 40
thieves had

password

computer,

them say

Sesame.”

shown in Figure 5-2. In addition to entering the password that protects
your transactions from being changed, you need to enter a date. Only
transactions dated earlier than this date are protected by the password.
From now on, whenever you attempt to change a transaction prior to
the date you set in the password window, or if you attempt to create a
new transaction with a date earlier than the password date, you are
required to enter a password in the window like the one shown in
Figure 5-3.
Choosing a bank
Every bank is not the same. Before you commit to an online relationship
with one bank, find out what online services that bank offers and how much
they cost. Here are some factors to consider:
✦Cost: Many, but not all, banks offer online services free of charge. Find
out how much your bank charges for online services before you jump in
and start using the services.
✦Perks: Some banks have great promotions when you open an account or
go online. Sometimes there are monetary awards. And some banks give a
free copy of Quicken software to customers who want to use the online
services.

✦Services: Not all banks offer the same type of online services. With
choices ranging from checking balances and viewing banking transac-
tions, to borrowing options, bill paying services, communication with
Quicken, and online transfers between accounts, there is a lot to choose
from. Think about what you want from a bank, and then find out what
the bank you are considering has to offer and how much it costs.
Because this is the age of the Internet, you’re not limited to conducting busi-
ness with a neighborhood bank. A nation of banks is available at your finger-
tips, waiting to serve you and offering a wide range of online services. What
you might have to give up in personalized service from a banker who knows
you by name, you have the ability to make up in efficient 24/7 service from a
bank that makes all of its services available online.
Setting up your online banking
Book II, Chapter 2 has a detailed example of how to set up a new online bank
account. Here’s what to do if you have an existing Quicken account that you
want to set up for online services.
1. Click on the Online menu and choose Online Account Services Setup.
The window you see in Figure 5-4 appears, listing all of your accounts.
2. Click on the name of the account you want to set up for online serv-
ices, click the Edit Existing Quicken Account option, and then click
Next.
3. Enter your login info.
You’re asked to enter your customer identification and PIN number. If
you’ve used the bank’s online services previously, this is the same login
information that you use on the bank’s Web site. If you haven’t used the
Figure 5-4:

196
bank’s online services before now, click the Sign Up Now option or call
the phone number that appears in the window to contact your bank and
request online privileges. You might have to allow a few days to receive
online user information by mail.
4. Click Next.
Quicken hops online to see if it can communicate with your bank. If
you’ve already established an online relationship with the bank, this
process should be a snap. If you’re waiting to get set up with the bank’s
online features, you may have to return to this online setup process in a
couple of days. Just click Cancel for now, and then repeat the earlier
steps when you return and Quicken takes care of the rest.
Paying Bills with Your Online Account
Now that you have online account access, you can choose from several ways
to pay bills. There’s still the old-fashioned way, where you write a check and
send it through the mail. Bor-ing. If you are accustomed to using your bank’s
online bill payment feature, you can go to the bank’s Web site and make a bill
payment over there. Nice, but still an extra step or two — you have to get
over to the bank’s Web site, enter the bill information, and later arrange to
transfer information about the bill payment into Quicken.
Here’s a fun way to pay bills that gets all of your record-keeping taken care 
of at the same time. Pay the bill in Quicken, and request that the bill be an
online payment. Quicken waits for your go ahead to actually dispatch the
bill, but you’ve got the payment made and recorded right from your Quicken
file. Book I, Chapter 2 contains a detailed description of Quicken’s check-
writing process — follow these steps, choosing the option to use an online
check.
After you’ve entered your check in Quicken and checked the Online payment
box, the check appears in your Quicken register with the SEND indicator in
the NUM column. When you’re ready to dispatch your online checks (and
remember, there’s no paper necessary here — these are checks you don’t
print), follow these steps to send your online payment on its way:
1. Open the Online Center by choosing Online Center from the Online
menu.
2. Issue the Send order.
Click the Update/Send button at the top of the Online Center window.
The Online Update window appears (see Figure 5-5).

3. Enter your PIN.
Before you can execute an online transaction, you have to prove that
you have the authorization to do so by entering your PIN number/
password in the box provided.
As an alternative, you can store all of your PIN numbers in Quicken’s PIN
Vault. Click the PIN Vault button in the Online Update window or the
button of the same name at the top of the Online Center. Quicken walks
you through the process of entering the PIN number you use for each of
your online institutions and asks you to assign a password to the PIN
Vault. Later, whenever you initiate online transactions, you are asked
only once for your PIN Vault password. Quicken retrieves all of your
passwords at once so you don’t have to supply a new password each
time you conduct a transaction with a different institution.
4. Make sure the correct boxes are checked.
By default, the option to download the latest information from your
accounts is selected. Also, the check box to process online payments is
checked. Make any changes to the services you want to order before
proceeding.
5. Click Update Now.
When you click the Update Now button, QuickBooks communicates with
your bank and performs the tasks you requested. When you request an
online payment, the payment’s processing begins when you click the
Update Now button. The accompanying description in your register
changes from Send to Sent and a little lightening bolt appears next to the
Sent indicator. You can see my payment has been sent in Figure 5-6.
The other online alternative for paying the bills is to use Quicken’s Bill Pay
service. We talk about this service in Chapter IV, Book 4.

Transferring Funds
You can easily transfer funds between accounts right from your Quicken reg-
ister using Quicken’s online banking features. Move money around from one
account to another by following these easy steps:
1. Open the register for the bank from which you want to transfer the
funds.
2. Enter today’s date.
3. Enter a new transaction, using OXFR (online transfer) as the code in
the NUM column.
4. Enter a description for this transaction.
5. Enter the amount of the transfer.
6. Choose the account to which you are making the transfer in the
Category field.
7. Record the transaction.
8. Open the Online Center by choosing Online➪Online Center.
9. Click the Update/Send button.

10. Enter your PIN number for this financial institution.
11. Click the Update Now button.
Quicken contacts the bank and executes the transaction. Unlike online bill
payments that usually need a few days to be processed, the funds transfer is
instantaneous.
Reconciling Your Online Bank Account
You know how much fun bank reconciliation is because you’ve already read
about the reconciliation process in Chapter 4. There are a few nuances to
discover when reconciling an online bank account.
First, note that every time you download your account activity with the
Update/Send button in the Online Center, Quicken lists new transactions it
has found and asks you to approve those transactions and match them with
transactions in your register. Then, each transaction you match is marked
with a little c to show that the item has cleared the bank.
Match online transactions pulled into Quicken from your bank account by
following these steps:
1. Go to the register that has online transactions to match.
After an online update session, Quicken provides you with an Online
Update Summary window. Any registers that have new transactions
needing your review include a Go to Register button you can click.
Alternatively, you can click the account name in the Account Bar on 
the left side of your screen.
2. View the new online transactions.
Quicken has listed the new online transactions at the bottom of the reg-
ister in an area headed Downloaded Transactions. If all of these transac-
tions are the result of online orders you gave in your register (like SEND
or OXFR), Quicken has no trouble finding the matching transaction in
the register, and you can save yourself some time by clicking the Accept
All button at the bottom of the list.
3. Click on a transaction to match.
If you want to make extra sure that Quicken matches these downloaded
transactions with the correct transactions in your register, click on one
transaction from the list. Quicken highlights the probable matching trans-
action in the register. If this match is correct, click the Accept button as
shown in Figure 5-7.

Reconciling Your Online Bank Account
200
4. Enter a category (maybe).
Sometimes transactions come over from the bank without categories.
You may be asked to assign a category to the transaction before Quicken
completes the match.
5. Edit the transaction match if necessary.
If Quicken can’t find the right transaction to match, click the Edit button,
and then click Edit Manually. A list of unreconciled transactions from
your account register appears. Check the transaction that goes with this
downloaded transaction, and then click Accept.
6. Enter the transaction if it is not already in the register.
When you make transactions at the bank or with your debit card and
neglect to enter them in your register, the result is downloaded transac-
tions that don’t have any match in the register. If there is no match avail-
able and the transaction needs to be added to the register, click the
Enter button to update your register by adding this transaction.
Matching transactions that are downloaded from your bank account is not
the same as reconciling your account. You still need to reconcile each month
when the statement comes. The good news is that all previously matched
transactions do not have to be matched again at reconciliation, so the recon-
ciliation process should be quick and easy.
Figure 5-7:

the match is
a good one.

 Finding your way around the Investing Center
 Entering investments in Quicken
 Tracking your investments
 Recording your investment income
 Selling your investments
Quicken has the capability of tracking all of your investments — from
money in the bank to pennies in a jar, from mutual funds in your
retirement account to stocks you purchased or received as gifts, and from
real estate to vehicles. The more of your financial self that you add to your
Quicken file, the more complete a picture you present for your own informa-
tion as well as your tax returns and even the person who handles your
estate. All of Book III concerns itself with tracking your investments. This
chapter gives the basic steps for entering investment information in
Quicken.
Navigating the Ins and Outs of the Investing Center
Quicken’s Investing Center contains four tabbed areas: Today’s Data,
Performance, Analysis, and Portfolio. Use these areas to find out useful
information about your investments, track their performance, and make
intelligent trading and investing decisions:
✦Today’s Data: See alerts about your specific investments; click the hot
button for automatic online updates to all of your investments; view
market value, total gain or loss, and the day’s gain or loss on each of
your investment accounts; use one-click options for adding new
accounts, editing accounts, and viewing a portfolio value report.
✦Performance: Compare your accounts’ performance with that of the
major indexes — S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones Industrials, and Russell
2000; retrieve historic prices for any of your investments going back as
much as five years; see a chart comparing your portfolio value to actual
cost; see a summary of your investing activity for the year.

✦Analysis: See a number of graphs and reports illustrating the asset allo-
cation and the Morningstar rating of your mutual funds investments.
✦Portfolio: See the details of each of your individual investments. Click
through on any investment to see a performance chart and your transac-
tion history.

Tracking Investments in Quicken
One of the primary reasons people purchase Quicken is to track their invest-
ments. If you’re not using Quicken for investments and you have any sort of
investment, including a company-sponsored retirement plan, it’s time to con-
sider beefing up your use of Quicken to include investment tracking.
Setting up investments in Quicken can be quick and easy or tedious and
dreary (see Book II, Chapter 3 for details). The mutual funds you’ve owned
forever seem to take forever to set up; that is, if you want to enter all of the
detail of monthly dividend reinvestments. But that’s all about historical data
entry. Entering investment information in Quicken as you acquire the invest-
ments is another story. You might find that the setup process is so quick and
easy, you’ll be encouraged to go out and invest in more stocks and mutual
funds, just so you can have the fun of setting them up and then monitoring
them in Quicken!
Hey Quicken! I Bought Some Shares of Stock!
You have to record a few basic pieces of information in your Quicken file in
order to keep track of your investments. This is all the basic stuff that you
ought to know about your investment purchases anyway. You’ll need this
information someday when you sell the investment — the IRS requires you
to keep track of all of this, so you might as well keep it nice and tidy in
Quicken.
Here are the facts that you need to know:
✦Date of purchase.
✦Cost: This is the cost of whatever investment you purchased plus any
commission you pay on the purchase.
✦Name of investment: This is the name of the company in which you
bought stock, the name of the mutual fund in which you bought shares,
the name of the organization from which you bought a bond, and so on.

Book III
Chapter 1

205
✦Number of shares.
✦Source of the money: This is a piece of information that Quicken wants
to know that you aren’t required to keep for tax records. In Quicken,
you’re going to record the purchase by showing from which account you
took the money.
Entering your investment in Quicken
OK, so you purchased some stock. Now you’ve got to get the stock into
Quicken so that Quicken can keep tabs on your stock’s performance and let
you know how your investment is doing. But first things first. Here’s how you
enter your stock purchase in Quicken:
1. Open a new account.
Assuming this is the first stock you’ve purchased, you’re going to need
an account for tracking your investment. Go to the Investing Center by
clicking Investing Center on the left side of your Quicken window, make
sure the Today’s Data tab is selected, and then click the Add Account
button.
2. Identify the type of account.
In the Account Setup window, click the option that states This Account Is
Not Held at a Financial Institution, and then click Next. For this example,
I’m choosing Standard Brokerage as the type of account (see Figure 1-1).
Use this option for securities you purchase yourself through any type of
brokerage, including the online discount brokers. Click Next when
you’ve made your selection.
Figure 1-1:

3. Give the account a name.
This is to distinguish this account from any other investment account
you have or might have in the future. If you and your wife each have an
investment account, you might call them Frankie’s Stocks and Johnny’s
Stocks, or if you have accounts with different brokers, you might call
them ABC Brokerage and DEF Brokerage. Any name is all right, as long as
it makes sense to you.
4. Enter the cash balance.
Sometimes people keep a cash balance at their brokerage firm so that
when you get a hot tip on a stock, there is cash on hand, ready to invest
right away, and you don’t have to wait to transfer funds to the broker. If
you have deposited cash with the broker, list that amount and the date
of your latest brokerage statement (or today, if you just signed up to
trade stocks today) when Quicken asks about your cash. Click Next to
continue.
5. List the securities.
Enter the ticker symbol and name of each stock and mutual fund that
you bought. If you don’t know the ticker symbol, click the Ticker Symbol
Lookup button at the bottom of the window and Quicken does the leg-
work in finding the ticker symbol you need. Click Next to continue.
The ticker symbols are important because that is what Quicken uses
to look up your securities and give you information about the latest
market value.
6. Enter the quantity of shares.
List the number of shares you own so Quicken can look up your stock on
the Internet and give you the current value of your investment. Click
Next to continue.
7. Verify information.
Quicken provides you with a summary screen (shown in Figure 1-2)
where you can verify the information you’ve entered. Click Back if you
need to make any changes, or Done if you’re ready to enter the cost
information for your investment.
8. Open the Enter Missing Transactions window so you can enter cost
information.
When you finish entering your investment information, the summary
screen for your account appears, as shown in Figure 1-3. To enter cost
information for a security, choose Value in the Show drop-down list.
Then click on the Enter option under the Cost Basis heading across from
your security name to open the window where you enter your cost infor-
mation. The Missing Transaction window appears.

top of the window before you begin entering your information. Here you
can enter the number of shares you purchased, the price you paid, and
the amount of commission you paid. Click Enter/Done to record your
entries.

Tracking investment performance
You’ve done the hard part in getting your investment entered in Quicken.
Now you can sit back and watch your portfolio grow! With live Internet
access, Quicken tracks the performance of your investments, giving you
current values for each investment you list in your Quicken file.
Quickly update the value of your stock market investments by clicking on
the Investing Center on the Quicken Account Bar at the left side of your
screen. Next, make sure you’re on the Today’s Data tab and click the
Download Quotes button. All of your investments are instantly updated.
Recording Dividends and Other Earnings
Mutual funds and many stock investments pay dividends. You might choose
to receive your dividends in the form of checks in the mail, or you might have
your dividends reinvested in more of the same stock and mutual funds. If you
receive your dividends as a cash payment, you need to record the deposit of
the dividends as Dividend Income and an increase to the cash account where

you need to record the increase in the value of your investment.
Follow these steps to record your dividends:

categorized properly as dividend, interest, or one of the capital gain dis-
tribution choices. Click Enter/Done to record your transaction and close
the window.
3b. Indicate the receipt of a reinvested dividend.
Alternatively, if you choose to have your dividends reinvested in the same

follow instructions 3b and 4b instead of 3a and 4a. Choose Reinvest —
Income Reinvested in the Enter Transaction field.
4b. Enter the date of the dividend, the name of the security, and the
amounts and number of shares you earned for each type of income
(dividend, interest, or the three capital gain options). Click
Enter/Done when you are finished.

Entering a Sale
Some people buy stock and keep it forever. Others cash out and move on. If
the time comes that you decide to sell your stock, you need to remove the
investment from your Quicken account; otherwise, Quicken continues to list
the investment as one of your assets and part of your net worth.
Enter a stock sale by following these steps:
1. On the Account Bar, click on the account where the stock is held.
2. Click the Enter Transactions button.
3. Choose Sell — Shares Sold from the Enter Transaction drop-down list,
as shown in Figure 1-6.
The window content changes to provide areas where you can enter the
details of your sale.

Quicken automatically fills in the quantity of shares you own. 
5. Enter the number of shares you sold.
If you sold all of the shares you own, choose the Sell All Shares in This
Account check box that appears in Figure 1-6. Otherwise, enter the exact
number (including decimal places if applicable) of shares you sold.

records the sale, removing the security from your investment account
and adding the sales proceeds to the account you indicated.
Selling specific lots of securities
When you sell a security, the assumption is that
the shares you are selling are the first shares
you purchased. But if you’ve purchased shares
at different times over the years, you might end
up paying higher tax by selling the first shares
you bought. The earlier shares might have cost
less than the more recent shares you bought,
and thus the profit (gain) on the sale will be
less, as will the tax, if you choose to sell the
shares you bought most recently instead of the
earlier purchases. (Keep in mind, however, that
shares purchased within the past year do not
qualify for the favorable long-term capital gain
tax rates that are enjoyed by shares from long
ago.)
So the bottom line is to be sure to calculate the
tax on different shares before you give the Sell
order. If you plan to sell shares other than the
first ones you purchased, you need to get this
information to your broker before the sale is
conducted.
Your broker isn’t the only one who assumes you
want to sell the earliest shares you purchased.
Quicken makes the same assumption, so if you
decide to pick and choose the shares you’re
selling, you need to get that information to
Quicken as well.
When recording your sale, click the Specify
Lots button to bring up a window showing each
group of shares that you purchased. You can
enter the number of shares from each group
that you plan to sell. Your tax accountant is
happy that Quicken includes this feature.

omewhere along the line, we all make the transition from childhood to
adulthood, from The Breakfast Club to Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and from
piggy banks to portfolios. It doesn’t really matter what type of portfolio you
have, or even if your investments are closer to the nonexistent bank
account in I Remember Mama than they are to the amassed wealth of
Warren Buffett. The important thing to remember is that Quicken can help
you monitor all of your investments, big and small, and can be useful as a
tool that helps your investments grow.
What You See in the Quicken Portfolio
In the last chapter, you discovered how to enter investments in Quicken.
Those investments are assembled all in one place for your viewing 
pleasure — the Quicken Portfolio. Click on the Investing Center over on
your Quicken Account Bar, and then on the Portfolio tab, and a summary 
of your investments appears.
If all of your investments are not yet listed in the Portfolio (for example, if
you forgot to enter all of those shares of Microsoft your grandfather bought
for you when you were a baby), head back to Book III, Chapter 1, and finish
entering the investments you own.
To enter additional investments, click on any account name in the Account
Bar or in the Investing Center, such as your brokerage account or your
401(k) account, and then click the Enter Transactions button. Note: After
clicking on an account name, you must select either the Transactions tab or
the Summary tab to see the Enter Transactions button.

What You See in the Quicken Portfolio
214
Here’s a sample of what you can see in your Quicken Portfolio (see Figure 2-1):
✦A list of each of your investment accounts by name. Each account is
hyperlinked so you can click on that account and get right to the detailed
screens for that account. The Unclassified category displays the follow-
ing stock index values: S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones Industrials, and
Russell 2000.
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index is made up of 500 large-company growth
stocks. The NASDAQ Composite Index is made up of all common stocks
listed on the NASDAQ and is used primarily to track technology stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the average of 30 blue chip stocks,
primarily industrial stocks, chosen by the editors of the Wall Street
Journal. The Russell 2000 Index tracks smaller company stocks.
✦A column showing the current market value for each account. Update
this market value at any time by clicking the Download Quotes option at
the top of the window.
✦A column calculating the percentage that each account represents of
your whole portfolio. This percentage is based on the market value of
the investments. The total of this column always adds up to 100 percent.
✦Columns showing the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year average annual
returns on each investment and each index, expressed in percent.

What you want to see: Changing your portfolio view
Several views of your portfolio are available. Each view provides somewhat
different information. However you left your portfolio view when you exited
Quicken last is the way the portfolio appears when you return. You can
create a customized view so that the portfolio window shows exactly what
you want to see.
✦Click on the Show drop-down list to see a plethora of pre-set portfolio

shown in Figure 2-2), and then pick and choose the types of information
and the accounts you want to include in your personal portfolio view.
Changing the portfolio date
By default, Quicken shows you your portfolio as of today. That makes sense,
right? Oh, but what if you want a reminder of how things stood a month ago?
Or a year ago? Or yesterday?

Cash transactions in your security account
Many people who actively trade securities keep a cash balance on deposit
with their broker, so there is no need to hurriedly transfer cash over to the
broker when they decide to make a purchase.
To transfer cash into your security account, follow these steps:
1. Click on the account name in the Account Bar on the left side of your
Quicken screen.
2. In the account window, click the Enter Transactions button.
The transaction window appears, with the heading Buy — Shares Bought.
3. Choose a transaction from the Enter Transaction drop-down list.
For this example, we want to transfer cash into the account, so select
Cash Transferred into Account from the drop-down list, as shown in
Figure 2-3.
4. Enter the date of the transfer in the Transaction Date field.

Your bank account is a likely source for funds. Pick the account where
the funds that you plan to transfer reside.
6. Enter the amount you are transferring.
7. Enter an optional description.
The description is just for your benefit, to remind you of what this trans-
action is all about.
8. Click Enter/Done to record the transaction.
Entries such as the transfer of cash to your brokerage account or the
actual purchase and sale of stocks are just that — entries. You still have
to execute the actual transfer or the purchase or sale yourself. What
we’re doing here is simply record-keeping.
Marginally interesting: How to record 
margin interest
People who want to take a greater risk than their cash holdings permit 
sometimes borrow from their broker. Known as margin trading, this form of
investing involves using the stock you purchase as collateral for a loan, and
that loan can be as high as 50 percent of the purchase price of the stock.
For example, you might decide to buy 100 shares of a stock that cost $10 per
share, or $1,000 worth of stock. With margin trading, you put up $500. Your
broker kicks in the other $500 and together you purchase the 100 shares of
stock in your name.
When you sell the stock, you get to keep the profits on all 100 shares, and
you pay back the broker. Sounds good? It can be a great deal, but there are
drawbacks to be sure. First, as long as you have the margin account, you
must pay interest on the amount you borrowed. Second, if you sell the stock
at a loss, you bear the entire burden of the loss on all 100 shares and still
have to pay back the broker the full $500 (plus interest).
Some brokers require you to repay part or all of your margin account before
you sell the stock if it looks like the stock is tanking. Also, the broker has the
right to sell the stock bought on margin or even other stock without your
permission if it appears that you are in danger of defaulting on your loan.
Make sure you read all the fine print that comes with your margin account
before making your investments.
When your broker charges you interest on your margin account, you need to
record that interest in Quicken. Here’s how:
1. Click on the name of the account where the interest is being charged.
For this example, I chose the brokerage account.

Realized versus Unrealized Gains and Losses
218
2. Click the Enter Transactions button, and the Transactions window
appears.
3. Choose the Margin Interest Expense option from the Enter
Transaction drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-4.
4. Enter the pertinent information.
Enter the date the interest was charged, the account that is paying the
interest (which may be the same brokerage account to which the inter-
est relates), and the amount of the interest.
5. Click Enter/Done to record the transaction.
Realized versus Unrealized Gains and Losses
In the good old days, investors opened the newspaper each evening to the
stock market page, checking to see how their investments did. In today’s
Internet society, we get an instant update on our computer. The end out-
come is the same — either you made a little money (or a lot, if you’re lucky)
or you lost a little money (or a lot, if you’re not so lucky), and you wait until
tomorrow and check the results again.
These winnings and losings in the stock market are called gains and losses
when you’re talking to accountants and your friends at the IRS. But gains and
losses on paper, or on your computer screen, although perhaps meaningful
to you, don’t mean anything to the tax authorities until you actually sell the
stock or the mutual fund.
Figure 2-4:
Enter your
margin
interest
expense.

Book III
Chapter 2

What’s in a Date?
219
And that is the difference between realized and unrealized gains and losses.
Unsold equals unrealized; sold equals realized. Unrealized means you can
talk about how much money you’re making in the stock market, but there’s
nothing in the bank to show for it. Realized means that you have to report
the sale on your tax return and pay tax on the gain or reduce your taxable
income.
Nothing is simple when it comes to dealing with the IRS. Although you are
required to pay tax on all of the profit that you make when you sell an invest-
ment at a gain, the IRS gets to pull in the reins on your losses and only lets
you deduct up to a maximum of $3,000 net loss on sales of investments. Any
additional loss gets carried forward to tax returns in future years.
What’s in a Date?
You need to keep track of some important dates when buying and selling
investments like stocks and bonds and mutual funds. The IRS expects you to
report the purchase date and the sales date of each investment so that the
holding period, the length of time you owned the security, can be determined.
Sometimes there is confusion about the dates. The purchase date is the date
you take ownership of the stock. That might not be the same date that you
turn your money over to your broker. The broker reports the correct date to
Special tax rates for capital gains
Investments that you own for at least six
months qualify for special tax treatment from
the IRS. The capital gain tax rate, applicable to
long-term (more than six months) capital gains,
is 15 percent (or 5 percent if your regular
income tax places you in the 10 percent or 15
percent tax bracket).
So, while income taxes soar up to a maximum
of 35 percent, your tax on the profit from invest-
ments maxes out at 15 percent, a rate that is
supposed to give you the incentive to invest
and to sell those investments without worrying
about paying high taxes.
In order to qualify for this special tax, you must
report your investment transactions on your tax
return and you must accurately record the
dates of your purchases and sales so that you
can determine if you meet the six-month hold-
ing period.
For this reason, you should look closely at the
timing of sales of investments. If you’re ready
to sell some shares of stock and you are a few
days short of owning the stock for six months,
consider the impact of the difference in the rate
of tax you’ll pay on the profit you make.
This is only one of several tax planning consid-
erations to contemplate when selling invest-
ments. It’s wise to talk with a tax professional
when your investments reach a point where
they significantly affect your tax return.

you, and even if your Quicken records show you didn’t pay on the date of
the purchase, it is the official purchase date as stated by the broker that you
need to record.
The sales date can be confusing too. The date of the sale is the trade date,
otherwise known as the settlement date. This is not the same as the date 
on which you get your money, and it might not be the same as the date on
which you tell your broker to execute the sale.
Check your documentation supporting the sale to make sure you record the
purchase and sale date correctly. Because there are different tax rates for
capital gain transactions based on how long you owned the asset, it’s imper-
ative that you have the correct dates.

A
re you saving money for the time in the future when you can’t or don’t
want to work any more? If you have a job now, you probably are saving
for retirement, in the form of a 401(k) or similar tax-deferred retirement plan
provided by your employer. And if you’re like most people, you agree to have
a certain amount of money taken out of your paycheck for that retirement
plan, you agree to a certain arbitrary mix of investments, and that’s as far
as your involvement in the retirement planning process goes. You can use
Quicken to keep track of your tax-deferred retirement investments, whether
your money is invested in a plan at work or if you have your own personal
accounts. But tracking your retirement funds is just the beginning. By using
Quicken to monitor your long-term investments, you can develop an aware-
ness of how your investments are doing and make intelligent decisions
about how your money should be invested. Start being proactive about
planning for your retirement!
How Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans Work
Over the years, Congress and the Internal Revenue Service have worked
together to create several types of investment opportunities for workers, and
the unifying incentive that has been linked to those opportunities is a defer-
ral of income taxes. What that means is that you can take some of your money
today and place it in an authorized type of long-term savings plan, and not
pay any income tax currently on both the amount you invest and the
amount the investments earn. You only pay tax on the money you withdraw
from your retirement savings plan when you actually make the withdrawals.

How Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans Work
224
To read more about withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts, see Book VI,
Chapter 2.
How 401(k)s work
The most common employer-provided retirement savings plan is the 401(k).
Variations include the 403(b) and the 457(b). You are allowed to contribute
up to a maximum of $14,000 per year based on 2005 rules, $15,000 in 2006,
and the annual amount is indexed for inflation in years after 2006.
The amount you can contribute each year to your 401(k) plan varies with
changes in the tax laws, but the amount you actually can contribute is based
on a percentage of your annual earnings and also certain limitations at your
workplace. Your employer can advise you how much you can actually con-
tribute each year.
If you are age 50 or older, you can take advantage of catch-up provisions that
allow you to contribute an additional amount to your 401(k). The catch-up
amount is $4,000 for 2005, $5,000 for 2006, and indexed for inflation in years
thereafter.
Many employers offer matching plans whereby the employer contributes a
percentage of your salary to the plan. For example, say you earn $50,000 a
year and your employer has a 3 percent match plan. This means that the
employer matches your annual contribution, up to a maximum of 3 percent
of your salary or, in this case, $1,500. So if you contribute $1,000 to your
plan, your employer contributes $1,000 as well. If you contribute $1,500 or
any higher amount to the plan, the employer contributes $1,500. The match
can be anywhere from nothing to 100 percent.
According to a 2003 survey conducted by Hewitt Associates, 96 percent of
employers provide some sort of matching or other company contribution to
employees’ 401(k) plans (Hewitt Associates, “2003 Trends and Experience in
401(k) Plans”).
When you contribute money to your 401(k), the amount you contribute is
withheld from your paycheck and no income tax is withheld on that money.
The amount you contribute is not included in your taxable wages on your
annual income tax return (however, you do pay Social Security tax and
Medicare tax on the amount that you put in your 401(k)).
The amount of tax you can save is significant. For example, if you are in the
25 percent income tax bracket and your state income tax rate is 4 percent,
and you stash $10,000 in your 401(k), you just saved yourself $2,500 on fed-
eral income tax and $400 on state income tax. That’s an excellent instant
return on your investment.

Book III
Chapter 3
Monitoring Your
Tax-Deferred
Retirement Account
How Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans Work
225
Years later, when you start taking money out of your 401(k), the amount you
withdraw is included in your taxable income on your income tax return.
Two theories are at play here — the first is that you are given incentive to
invest with the tax deferral up front. The second is that, if you play your
cards right and don’t get particularly wealthy in your old age, your tax rate
when you start withdrawing 401(k) money is lower or at least no higher than
the rate you were paying when you made the contributions, so you save
money on the tax deferral.
How traditional IRAs work
There are similarities between IRAs and 401(k)s, such as tax deferral on con-
tributions and earnings, annual limitations on contribution amounts, and
emotional highs from knowing that you’re looking out for the future, but
there are several differences between the two types of plans as well:
✦You get to pick your investments with an IRA. With a 401(k), your
employer provides you with a selection of some investments from which
to choose — maybe 3 or 4 or maybe as many as 15 or 20, but there is a
limit. With an IRA, you control the investment choices — you can pick
whatever you want to invest it in, be it stocks or mutual funds, and
spread your investments over as many or as few different selections as
you want.
✦You may not get a tax deferral on your contribution. Contributions to
401(k) plans are tax-deferred. The tax-deferral opportunities on IRA con-
tributions depend on several factors including how much income you
make, whether you participate in a retirement plan at work, and your
spouse’s income and retirement participation as well.
✦The limit on annual contributions to an IRA can be significantly lower
than that of the 401(k). The IRA contribution is limited to $4,000 in 2005
with a $500 catch-up provision for people age 50 and over. This amount
is further limited by the amount of income you earn.
✦It’s easier to get your hands on the IRA money. You can take your IRA
money out of its tax-protected environment and spend it whenever you
want. Yeah, there’s a penalty and some tax involved, but nevertheless,
it’s your money and you can take it if you need to. The 401(k) money is
much more difficult to get at unless you leave your job.
✦There is an option to borrow against your 401(k). No loans are avail-
able with an IRA — either the money stays in the IRA or it doesn’t. With
a 401(k), you can borrow up to 50 percent of the fund balance without
cashing out the fund, and then you make payments back to the fund,
reinstating your balance. Loan rules vary from plan to plan — your
employer can give you the details of how borrowing works with your
401(k) plan.

✦There’s no opportunity for an employer match with an IRA since this
isn’t a plan created at work. The annual maximum contribution limit is
the maximum and that’s final.
✦The IRS permits the creation of a spousal IRA for spouses who don’t
work. Even if your spouse has no earned income, a spousal IRA can be
created and the maximum contribution can be made to that account
each year, as long as the working spouse has earned income at least as
high as all IRA contributions for both spouses.
How Roth IRAs work
Like their IRA cousin, the Roth IRAs allow an annual contribution of up to
$4,000 for 2005 (with a $500 50-and-over catch-up provision), as long as you
earn at least as much as you contribute.
There are, however, some interesting differences between the two types of
retirement plans:
✦There is an income threshold on the Roth IRA. If you make too much
money, you can’t play the Roth game. You start losing the ability to con-
tribute to a Roth IRA if your income is over $95,000 and you’re single, or
over $150,000 if you’re married and filing a joint tax return.
✦There is no age limit with the Roth IRA. You can make contributions no
matter how old you get. With a regular IRA, you have to stop making
contributions in the year in which you hit age 701⁄2.
✦There is no age requirement for mandatory withdrawals of money from
the Roth IRA. You are required to start taking money out of a regular IRA
in the year in which you reach age 701⁄2. For the Roth, you never have to
take the money out: You can leave the money invested until you die and
the investments then get passed on to your beneficiaries. Furthermore,
when you do start withdrawing money, you can withdraw as little or as
much as you want — there is no required withdrawal formula like there is
with the traditional IRA.
✦The money in your Roth IRA grows tax-free as opposed to tax-deferred
in the traditional IRA. As long as you keep your money in a Roth for at
least five years and you reach at least age 591⁄2, you can take the money
out whenever and however you want, with no tax consequences.
Hey Quicken! How About Keeping Track
of My 401(k) Contributions?
Your employer takes your 401(k) contribution out of your paycheck, and 
you record you paycheck in Quicken. But do you keep track of your 401(k)

investment in Quicken? Or do you just record the fact that you made a con-
tribution to the company retirement plan?
Your 401(k) contribution is probably split among a few different funds, based
on a percentage you chose when you agreed to make the contribution. It’s a
simple matter to create those funds in your Quicken portfolio, and then
order Quicken to increase each of the funds with each paycheck.
The next obvious step is to have Quicken continuously update your portfo-
lio, including your 401(k) investments, so that you actually know how much
money is accumulating in your retirement fund. In this way, you are guaran-
teed a much clearer picture of your total finances.
Because you already enter your paycheck in Quicken, you know how to
create a split transaction for your withholdings. (You do enter your pay-
check in Quicken, don’t you? If you haven’t set up your paycheck yet, head
back to Book II, Chapter 2 for a quick refresher.) Before you can update your
401(k) investments with your regular contributions, you need to add those
investments to your portfolio. If you haven’t done so already, return to Book
II, Chapter 3 and set up your 401(k) in Quicken.
OK, so you’ve got your paycheck set up in Quicken, and you’ve added your
401(k) investments to your portfolio. The next step is to figure out how
much of each paycheck goes to each investment in your 401(k) plan. Start by
confirming how your investment contribution is split. You may need to con-
sult with your employer to get this information.
For purposes of this example, say you have your 401(k) investment going
into three different mutual funds, one half to one fund, and one quarter to
each of the other two funds. I’ll cleverly call those funds Fund A (which gets
50 percent), Fund B, and Fund C.
You have two choices for updating your 401(k) activity in Quicken. You can
either update your 401(k) contributions manually, or you can arrange for an
automatic download.
Updating 401(k) the hard way: Manual updates
As you can see in Figure 3-1, Quicken’s standard paycheck setup process
allows you to earmark the 401(k) contribution that comes out of your pay-
check. However, in this paycheck setup, you don’t get to specify the distribu-
tion of the money to your various investments. Here’s how you can place
your 401(k) contributions in the proper funds. Note: You need a copy of your
401(k) account statement in order to complete this task.
1. Click on the name of your 401(k) account in the Account Bar.
The Summary page for your 401(k) account appears.

Hey Quicken! How About Keeping Track of My 401(k) Contributions?
228
2. Click the Transactions tab.
After a paycheck has been entered in your bank account register, you
see that your cash balance in your 401(k) has been increased by the
amount of your 401(k) payroll deduction. In addition, if you set up an
employer matching amount when you set up your paycheck, that match-
ing amount also has been added to your cash balance.
If you’ve been entering paychecks in Quicken for quite awhile but
haven’t been checking in on your 401(k) account in your portfolio, you
might find that you have quite a few additions to your cash balance that
haven’t been transferred over to actual investments.
3. Enter a “buy” transaction in your register to clear the cash balance
and populate your investments.
Click the Enter Transactions button, and then choose Buy — Shares
Bought to enter a transaction to buy shares. Use the number of shares
purchased with your cash transfer according to your 401(k) account
statement, and indicate that the cash is to come from the cash balance
in this account (see Figure 3-2).

How your

There usually is some rounding on mutual fund account statements. The
number of shares that you purchase is presented in decimal places (often
to the thousandth), but that may not be precise enough to exactly match
the dollar amount you invest. Quicken requires precision to six decimal
places on the number of shares you purchase, so your share quantity in
Quicken may differ minutely from the quantity that appears on your account
statement.
Because the value of the shares in a mutual fund constantly fluctuates, you
can’t set up this transaction as an automatic memorized transaction in
Quicken. Each time you make a contribution to your 401(k) account, you need
to make an adjustment to the portfolio in Quicken. Otherwise, see the next
section for a good argument for using the online update feature in Quicken.
If your employer made a matching contribution, this amount must also be
incorporated into your 401(k) account. See “Editing paychecks and entering
employer matches” below.
Updating 401(k) the easy way: Entering the
statement summary
OK, enough of entering by hand. If you’ve got several mutual fund accounts
floating around in your 401(k), and you make a contribution with every pay-
check, you’re going to want a quicker way to enter your 401(k) updates.

Forget about going through the steps listed in the last section. Try this step
instead: After you enter your paycheck (or have your paycheck automati-
cally entered as a scheduled transaction), click on the 401(k) account in
your Account Bar, and then click the Update 401(k) Holdings button at the
top of the window. (Note: the Update button appears in both the Summary
and the Transactions tabs.) Quicken uses the Update 401(k) wizard to walk
you through entering the latest information from your 401(k) statement.
The wizard asks all the right questions to bring your 401(k) Quicken account
in line with the actual 401(k) account (see Figure 3-3).
Combine the Update 401(k) Holdings option with Quicken’s One-Step
Updates and your 401(k) account will always be completely up-to-date.
Editing paychecks and entering employer matches
If you track your paycheck in Quicken and your
employer provides you with matching 401(k)
contributions, you can track that matching
amount along with your other paycheck infor-
mation. Here’s how:
1. Click the Cash Flow Center on your
Account Bar.
2. From within the Cash Flow Center, click on
one of the paycheck buttons.
There is a Set Up Paycheck button on the
My Data tab and there is an Add Paycheck
button on the Analysis & Reports tab. Both
buttons take you to the same place.
3. Follow the steps to set up your paycheck if
you haven’t done so already.
For detailed information on setting up your
paycheck, see Book II, Chapter 2. When
you enter your 401(k) deduction information
with your paycheck setup, there is an
opportunity to enter an employer match
amount. If you’ve already set up your 
paycheck, a Manage Paychecks window
appears when you click the button in step
2. Click on your employer’s name and click
the Edit button. The Edit Future Paychecks
window appears.
4. Click the Edit button in the Employer Match
section in the Edit Future Paychecks
window.
5. An Edit 401(k) Deduction window appears.
Enter your employer’s matching amount in
the Employer Match field, and then click
the OK button.
Your paycheck information is now updated
to include an employer match.
6. At any time in the future, you can follow
these steps to edit your paycheck, making
any necessary changes to your income and
deduction amounts.

As important as it is to monitor your company-sponsored 401(k) account,
it’s even more important to keep tabs on your personal IRA in Quicken. No
one is responsible for the performance of the investments in your personal
IRA except you. You made the choices regarding how you plan to invest your
money, and it’s up to you to keep tabs on those investments and make
changes when necessary.
If you haven’t yet set up your IRA, go back to Book II, Chapter 3 where you
can find general information on account setup.
Look, Mom: I’m saving for my retirement!
The simplest way to save money in your IRA is to set up automatic transfers
into the account, either from your bank account, or directly from your pay-
check. The automatic transfers are a mindless and virtually painless way
to save.
Transferring money into an IRA needs to be a one-way street. Don’t put
money in your IRA that you expect to withdraw and use for everyday
expenses. You can use a savings account or a money market for that type of
saving. Only transfer money to an IRA when you are committed to leaving
the money in there until you can remove it without penalty (typically, this
means waiting until you are at least age 591⁄2, although there are exceptions
to that rule).
Figure 3-3:

Manipulating Your Traditional IRA in Quicken

Because of the nature of IRAs (sometimes you can make contributions that
are tax-deferred, and other times your contributions are made with money
that has already been taxed), you need a way to keep track of whether your
IRA contributions have been taxed.
The IRA trustee doesn’t keep track of how your contributions were treated
for tax purposes — it’s up to you to take care of that.
Entering tax-deferred contributions
You can make a contribution to your IRA in one of several ways. You can
transfer funds from one account to another, set up a payroll deduction at
work, or, as shown in the account register in Figure 3-4, simply write a check
and send it to your IRA trustee.
To make sure Quicken tracks your IRA contributions correctly, ensure that
your IRA is set up properly in Quicken. Follow these steps to set up your IRA
as a tax-deferred account:
1. Open the Account List.
Press Ctrl+A to open the list of all your Quicken accounts.
Figure 3-4:
One way to
make con-
tributions to
your IRA is

2. Choose your IRA account to edit.
Click on the IRA account, and then click the Edit button at the top of
the list.
3. Open Tax Schedule information for your account.
In the Account Details window that appears, click the Tax Schedule Info
button at the bottom.
4. Enter appropriate tax information to indicate the tax-deferred status
of this account.
In the Tax Schedule Information window (see Figure 3-5), choose Form
1040, IRA Contribution. Choose from either Self or Spouse, depending on
whomever you decide is the self and the spouse in your family. Then
click OK, and then OK again to close the windows.
You can find more information about assigning tax attributes to amounts
in Quicken by looking in Book V.
5. Open the Tax Planner.
You can find the Tax Planner on the Tax menu, or click on the Tax
Planner link that appears in the Financial Overview window.
6. Go to the Adjustments screen.
Click Adjustments on the left side of the Tax Planner to view the IRA sec-
tion of your tax information. You’ll see that 100 percent of your IRA con-
tribution appears on the first line of the Adjustments to Income section
(see Figure 3-6).
The next steps describe how to change this entry so that some or all of the
contribution is not allowed as a deduction.
Entering non-tax-deferred contributions
Sometimes IRA contributions are not tax-deductible. Either you don’t meet
the criteria for having enough income or you participate in a retirement plan
at work that, combined with your income level, prevents you from taking a

tax deduction. Or maybe you simply prefer to pay tax on your money now
and not take a current deduction for your IRA contribution. Whatever the
reason, when you make your contribution, as described in the previous sec-
tion, here’s how to tell Quicken not to treat this as a deductible contribution.
Continuing from the previous steps:
1. Click the Allowable IRA Deduction hyperlink.
The screen scrolls down, and the Allowable IRA Deduction section
appears. So far, all of the contribution is being treated as deductible.
2. Click the User Entered radio button, and then enter the amount of the
IRA contribution that you plan to treat as a tax deduction.
For this example, the entire $100 contribution is being treated as non-
tax-deductible, so zero is entered in the User Entered field, as shown in
Figure 3-7. The amount you enter in the User Entered field remains in
place for future contributions.
3. Scroll back up to the top of the screen, and you’ll see that the
Allowable IRA Deduction amount has changed to zero.
Note: There may be other amounts in the fields on this screen, depend-
ing on the other entries you have made in Quicken.

Quicken continues to categorize future IRA contributions in the same way as
the one you set up in the Tax Planner. Should you change your treatment of
IRA contributions, or find at a later date that contributions previously cate-
gorized as non-deductible are indeed deductible, go back to the Tax Planner
and change the entry in User Entered. Alternatively, click the Quicken Data
button just beneath the User Entered button to switch the contributions to
all deductible.
Sometimes you don’t know if your IRA contribution is going to be deductible
until the end of the year. Make a note, or schedule a reminder to go to the
Tax Planner before you prepare your tax return and address the deductibil-
ity of your IRA contributions, making any necessary reclassifications.
The IRA tax planning features described here are only available in Quicken
Deluxe, Premier, and Home & Business.
IRA contributions are easier when you
don’t have to think about them
For some people, writing a check and depositing that amount in a savings or
retirement account gives them a sense of connection with the money in sav-
ings, and a sense of reward. For others, getting around to writing that check
just never seems to happen. If you intend to transfer money to your IRA but
never seem to get around to it, let Quicken do the job for you.

Set up a scheduled transaction that automates the transfer of money into
your IRA. Pick a day of the month, choose an amount you can afford to move
out of your bank account without any hardship (remember, this money is
going into your untouchable funds — so don’t transfer more than you can
afford to be without), and don’t worry about having to remember to transfer
the money yourself.
In order to automate a transfer of funds, the bank account you use as the
source of the money must be set up for online transactions, and the receiv-
ing account must be able to receive the transfer.
Here’s a quick way to turn the job of saving over to Quicken:
1. Open the Scheduled Transaction List.
Choose Scheduled Transaction List from the Cash Flow menu or press
Ctrl+I.
2. Open the Create Scheduled Transaction dialog box.
Click the Create New menu and choose Scheduled Transaction. The Create
Scheduled Transaction dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-8.
3. In the Account to Use field, enter the account that the money is to be
transferred out of.
This can be any type of bank account that is set up for online
transactions.

4. Choose Online Payment from Quicken as the transaction method.
Because you’re going to automate this transaction, you need to pick the
online payment method. That way, Quicken can make the transaction
even if you’re not around. Note: The option for online payment does not
appear on the menu if you picked an account that is not set up for online
transactions.
5. Check the box to repeat automatic payments even when you’re not
online.
By checking this box, you authorize Quicken to take the money out of
your bank account and make the transfer, even if you don’t open your
Quicken program.
Make sure you plan on having money in your account each month to
cover the transfer — you’ve told Quicken to make the transfer without
your monthly approval, so the funds need to be in your account.
6. Enter the name of the payee, and the category (in this case, the cate-
gory is Steve’s IRA, as shown in Figure 3-8).
When you enter the payee name, Quicken searches for the address and
account information for this payee. If you haven’t already entered this
information in Quicken, a little box pops up, asking you to fill in the
blanks. This information is crucial, so make sure you fill in the blanks
accurately. This tells Quicken where to send the payment and to what
account number the payment gets credited.
Here’s a timesaver you can use when creating this scheduled transac-
tion. If you’ve already entered a transaction in your register that is like
the one you want to schedule, click on that transaction, and then right-
click and choose Schedule Transaction from the pop-up menu that
appears. Quicken then automatically fills in information like the amount,
the account, and the payee.
7. In the Scheduling section of the dialog box, enter the next date on
which you want a payment to be made. Then, enter the frequency of
the payments (Monthly is already selected as the default frequency).
Quicken assumes you want to make your payments on the same day
each month. So if you enter a payment to be made on the first of the
month, as in the example in Figure 3-8, Quicken takes it from there and
makes a payment on the first of every month.
8. Choosing the No End Date option means Quicken continues to make
these payments forever.
You can set a date when you want the payments to end, or indicate a
fixed number of payments by choosing the other options here.
9. Click OK and your payment is officially scheduled.

Manipulating Your Traditional IRA in Quicken
238
Another easy way to transfer money into your IRA without having to think
about it is to set up a payroll deduction at your job. Let your boss take care
of getting your money into your IRA and you can think of the transfer as just
another payroll deduction.
Wait: I can’t spare the money 
for this month’s transfer!
Don’t forget that Quicken has been given the green light to transfer funds
each month, without waiting you’re your approval. But what happens if you
want to stop the transfer?
You can intercept a transfer by following these steps:
1. Open the Scheduled Transactions List (Ctrl+J).
2. Click on the Repeating Online tab, where you’ll see the next transfer
transaction, ready and waiting for the transfer date.
3. Double-click on the transaction.
The Edit Current Transaction and Enter into Register dialog box appears
(Figure 3-9).
4. Click the Skip button.
The Edit window disappears, and the transaction listed on the Repeating
Online list has now been bumped up to the next scheduled date.
If you don’t need to see the details of the scheduled transaction, you can
save a couple of steps when skipping a transaction by opening the Scheduled
Transactions List (step 1 above), and then clicking the Skip button that
appears to the right of each transaction. Click Yes when a box appears
asking you to verify that you want to skip one transaction.

If you need to skip a payment, be sure you open up Quicken before the date
of the transfer. Otherwise, Quicken will have already sent the money.
If you decide to remove the automatic payment order completely, go to the
Repeating Online tab of the Scheduled Transactions List, click on the trans-
action, and then click the Delete button at the top of the list.
Having Your IRA the Roth Way
The modern-day alternative to the traditional IRA is the Roth IRA — a tax-
free option for those who don’t qualify or prefer not to make tax-deductible
contributions to a tax-deferred account. The Roth is a totally tax-free invest-
ment. The money you contribute is taxed when you earn it, and you get no
deduction for your contribution, but the earnings in the Roth are not taxed,
not even when you withdraw them.
The details of who gets to contribute to a Roth IRA are covered in Book I,
Chapter 1. Here we discuss how to make contributions to the Roth through
your Quicken program.
The only difference in the process of making contributions to a Roth IRA and
a traditional IRA is that the Roth is set up in Quicken as a tax-free IRA account.
Here’s how:
1. Open the Investing Center in Quicken by clicking Investing Center on
your Account Bar at the left side of the screen.
2. Click the Add Account button.
Note that you’re adding an investment account. This is different from
the type of account you would create if you were to click the Add
Account button in the Cash Flow Center, so be sure you’re clicking the
right button. An alternative is to open the Account list (Ctrl+A) and click
the Add Account button at the top of the list. This option also lets you
select an IRA.
3. Indicate whether the account is held at a financial institution, and
then click Next.
For this example, I choose the option that the account is not at a finan-
cial institution.
4. Choose IRA or Keogh as the type of account, and then click Next.
5. Give the account a name that distinguishes this account from every
other account you’ve created.

Having Your IRA the Roth Way
240
You can have more than one IRA account. There’s really no limit to how
many different IRA accounts you open; the limit is on the annual contri-
bution amount — but that contribution can be made to one account or
spread over several accounts.
6. If you are married, indicate if this account is yours or your spouse’s —
IRAs cannot be jointly owned.
7. Choose Roth IRA for the type of IRA, and then click Next.
8. Enter information from your most recent IRA statement.
If this is a new IRA, you can leave the amounts set at zero
9. Enter the securities held in this account, as shown in Figure 3-10. You
can just enter the ticker symbol if you want and Quicken will enter
the rest of the information. If you don’t know the ticker symbol, click
the Ticker Symbol Lookup button at the bottom of the screen. Click
Next when you’ve entered all of your investments.
It’s OK to create your Roth IRA account without any securities. Perhaps
you’re opening the account with the intention of transferring securities
from another account or purchasing securities later. Just leave the secu-
rities list shown in Figure 3-10 empty and click Next, and then verify that
you don’t plan to enter any securities.
10. Enter the number of shares you own. Click Next, verify your informa-
tion, and then click Done.
Notice that you haven’t yet entered any cost information in this account.
Click the Enter hyperlink that appears under the title Cost Basis on the sum-
mary screen for your Roth IRA, and then you can enter information about
when you purchased the shares and how much they cost.

Having Your IRA the Roth Way
241
There’s no need to monitor mutual fund buy/sell dates in your IRA and your
401(k) like you would in a non-tax-deferred fund — there are no capital gain
and loss considerations in the tax-deferred funds because the money is all
taxed with your ordinary income.
From Traditional to Roth: Transferring
retirement funds
Traditional IRAs have been around since 1974; the Roth IRA was born in
1997, so it stands to reason that a lot more people have money tucked away
in traditional IRAs than they do in Roth IRAs. Yet the Roth is a very appeal-
ing investment for many people. After you get the money into the Roth, and
assuming you follow a few simple rules (you have to keep the money in the
Roth for five years and you must be at least age 59 1/2 when you take any
money out), there is no more tax to pay — ever.
So what’s a person to do if she wants to get that traditional IRA money into a
Roth where it can continue to grow, tax-free? Move the money. Period. It’s that
simple. Well, almost that simple. Truth is, whenever you take money out of 
a traditional IRA, even if you’re moving the money into a Roth IRA, which is
another type of IRA, you have to pay income tax on the money. You can trans-
fer the funds from traditional to Roth without the nasty 10 percent penalty
that applies to early IRA withdrawals, but you still have to pay the tax.
Many people see this tax situation as a detriment and avoid switching the
money because of the tax. That’s a fallacy, however: The tax is just a ticking
time bomb. The sooner you get the money out of the traditional IRA and into
a Roth, the sooner you can lock in the amount of tax and let the rest of the
money grow, tax-free.
Converting traditional IRA money to a Roth all at once
Taking all of your IRA money out of your traditional IRA and placing it in a
Roth is one option — you’ll pay high taxes in the year of the switcheroo, but
then you’ll be finished with the old IRA and can let your investments grow
without a lot of icky rules about taxes and penalties.
Make sure you convert your money from one IRA to another with the help of
your IRA trustee. Otherwise, the conversion might be misunderstood by the
IRS and you may get hit with a 10 percent penalty on top of the income tax.
Your trustee knows what paperwork needs to be filed to get the conversion
done properly.
Converting traditional IRA money to a Roth at a leisurely pace
Moving your money over to a Roth a little bit each year, paying the tax when
the extra money fits into your budget is another very attractive option.

Diversification: The Great Investment Elixir
242
There’s no limit to how much or how little money you transfer to the Roth or
when you make the transfer. The only catch is that your income has to be
under the Roth threshold. In other words, in any year in which you transfer
money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you must qualify to make a Roth
contribution (see Book I, Chapter 1 for the Roth contribution rules).
The possibility exists that you thought your income was going to be low
enough that you would qualify for a traditional-to-Roth IRA conversion, but it
turned out that you got a big bonus in December and your income catapulted
over the Roth threshold. Call your IRA trustee as soon as you know this and
arrange to have the conversion undone — this is called recharacterization.
There’s no tax or penalty on recharacterizing the conversion, as long as you
get it done by October 15 of the year following the year of the conversion.
Diversification: The Great Investment Elixir
Most analysts tell you that the best advice for safe investing is diversification —
otherwise known as not putting all your eggs in one basket. By diversifying,
you ensure that if one investment goes sour, you don’t spoil all of your sav-
ings. Most former Enron employees would probably agree with that advice
today, and you might agree with it as well.
One of the main principals of investment diversification is to divide your
money among investments with varying degrees of risk. Some money should
be placed in low-risk funds that might not have a great return in terms of
interest rates or dividend payout, but that are most likely to keep your money
safe and secure. Money that you hope will grow but that, if worse came to
worse, you could actually live without, can go into the riskier investments,
investments that pay a higher return but that could just as easily go belly-up
at a moment’s notice.
Most people strive for lower risk in their investments as they age, switching
their invested money from items like speculative stocks to the more reliable
investments such as bonds and bank CDs. Today, however, investment 
advisors are taking a second look at that advice in light of the fact that life
expectancy continues to lengthen and cutting your investments back to the
least risky bonds and CDs can lessen your revenue to the point where you
won’t have enough money to grow old on.
The most important consideration when planning on your retirement invest-
ment mix is to constantly monitor your investments, making sure that they
perform the way you want, and also regularly review your retirement plan so
that you can be secure in your old age. Book VI covers retirement planning
and various savings plans in much more depth.

o you feel like you’re operating in the dark when it comes to choosing
which investments to buy and allocating your money between your
various investments? If you do, you’re certainly not alone. Esteemed finan-
cial analysts agree that at least 93.7 percent of people who invest money in
stocks and mutual funds are completely clueless as to how they should
make investment decisions. OK, I’m making that percentage up, but I’m sure
that there are lots and lots of you out there who invest based on a tip from a
trusted friend or family member, choose investments because your employer
made them available to you, and buy shares of some stock you never heard
of because you overheard a tip on the bus or train on the way home from
work. Am I right? Your approach can and should be more businesslike, and
in this chapter, I show you how.
Start by Reading the News
Every major city has a newspaper that contains a business section. In addi-
tion to the business section in major city newspapers, USA Today has a
business section, and there is always the Wall Street Journal, a national
newspaper that is nothing but a business section. If you really want busi-
ness news, it’s not difficult to find.
In addition to the sources just mentioned, specialized newspapers and mag-
azines about business abound, and entire newspapers and magazines are
devoted to educating people who are really serious about learning how to
invest. And that’s just the print media.
Because you’re reading this book about Quicken, one can presume that you
have a computer at your disposal, and thus one can further presume that
you have Internet access, and there’s very little to read about any subject
that can’t be found somewhere on the Internet.

Start by Reading the News
244
The trick to educating yourself about investing is not so much finding the
news as it is sifting through the news and deciding which news to read. The
best way to start is to just pick something and start reading. As you get
familiar with one source of business and investment information, you can
find what interests you and what you want to find out more about. At that
point, you can start seeking more specialized information.
What to look for when you read the investment news
Because each person has different tastes in investing (which goes a long way
toward explaining why there are actually more than 10,000 mutual funds in
existence), I can’t tell you what to read about, but I can tell you some points
to remember when you start reading about businesses and investments:
✦Read more than one source of information about a particular com-
pany. Each article you read presents an opinion of someone who is sup-
posedly educated about analyzing investments choices and about the
company or mutual fund in question. So seek out a second opinion. And
a third. When you start hearing the same things over and over again,
you can start believing what you read.
✦Look for some background information on the companies in which
you consider investing. Don’t buy stock in a company because the
name sounds good. If you’re considering investing in a manufacturing
company, find out what the company makes and why it makes that, how
long it’s been making that, who buys it, how the item is used, and how
long into future we can expect people to want that item. Who else is
making the same thing, and which company makes the better item,
which company charges more and why, how long the people making
decisions have been around at that company? In other words, know
what you’re buying.
✦Find out how to read stock market reports. Plenty of Web sites, books,
and articles explain how to understand all of the mumbo-jumbo (highly
technical financial term) that appears on the stock pages in the newspa-
pers. Do an Internet search or pick up a copy of Investing For Dummies,
3rd edition, by Eric Tyson (Wiley) if you need a primer on what the num-
bers mean.
Reading news in Quicken
Lo and behold! You can read investment news right in your very own Quicken
program! Click on the Investing Center over on the Account Bar in Quicken.
At the top of the Investing Center window, you see Investment Alerts.
Quicken mines news from highly regarded sources including BusinessWire
and PRNewswire, Morningstar, Zacks.com, and Briefing.com to provide you
with the latest news and analysts’ opinions about the investments you have
chosen.

Click on any of the hyperlinks in your investment alerts (see Figure 4-1) to see
what’s happening with the companies and mutual funds that interest you.
Hey, Don’t Forget This Important Investment News!
The Alerts section of your Investing Center is not just for the alerts that
Quicken provides. This section is customizable: You can ask Quicken to add
your own alerts, reminding you of specific events, transactions, or anything
else financial.
For example, you can set alerts to tell you when a stock hits a certain price,
or you can ask to be reminded that you get an extra paycheck in June, so
that is a good time to give your investments a boost. Remind yourself a
month before annual or semi-annual payments like life insurance or property
tax are due so that you won’t be caught off-guard when the bills arrive.
Consider setting reminders for more esoteric events, such as scheduling an
appointment with your homeowner’s insurance agent to make sure you’re get-
ting the best price and covering your home and your possessions properly.

If you’re one of those people who pays quarterly estimated tax payments,
set a reminder so that you won’t miss your filing date. Keep in mind that
whenever the 15th of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or post office
holiday, your tax payment is not due until the next business day.
Also, if you’re setting tax payment reminders, be sure to double-check the
tax payment dates in your state. Some states’ quarterly payment dates do
not coincide with the federal dates.
Find more information about estimated taxes, including a complete chart of
federal estimated tax filing due dates, in Book V.
Set yourself a reminder about a particular account by following these steps:
1. Click on the Investing Center option in the Account Bar.
2. Make sure the Today’s Data tab is selected.
3. Click the Set Up Alerts button.
The Alerts Center window shown in Figure 4-2 appears.
4. On the left side of the window, select one of the alert types.
Note that the headings are not types. You must select one of the types,
such as Price and Volume under the Investing heading, or Monthly
Expenses under the Cash Flow heading (see Figure 4-2). For this exam-
ple, I do one of each of these two reminder types.

with a pop-up box. Choose either Text or Urgent at the bottom of the
expense list.
8. Indicate how long you want this limit to stick around.
You can have the spending limit stay in the reminders list for a day, a

drop-down list that appears at the bottom of the window.
Now set up an investing alert:
1. Click on Price and Volume under the Investing heading.
2. Click on the Go to Quicken.com to Customize Price and Volume Alerts

Quicken Watch Lists

Quicken Watch Lists
For those Quicken users who prefer a more vicarious approach to tracking
the stock market, the Quicken Watch List fits the bill. You can add stocks
and other investments to your Watch List and, well, watch them, just as you
would watch a stock you own, but without the need for prescription drugs
when your stocks take a nose-dive.
I recommend that beginning investors work with play money for awhile
before they commit to the real thing. Pick a nice round amount, say $5,000,
and pretend you’re going to invest that money in the stock market. Choose
the stocks or funds or bonds that you would buy, if you were going to do this
for real, and place those investments on your Watch List. Then watch. Read
the news alerts every day. See how your investments improve (or don’t).
Wait 30 or 60 days, or however long it takes until you feel like you’re com-
fortable enough with these investments to talk intelligently about them and
maybe even make some reasonable predictions as to what they’re going to
do next. (This is not to say that investments are ever predictable. The only
think I’ve ever been able to predict about investments is that as soon as I
buy them, the price goes down, and as soon as I give up on them and sell,
the price shoots right up.)
If your investments soared sky-high, use what you learned about picking
those investments to choose again, this time for real.

If you lost your shirt during your watching period, take solace in three
important pieces of information. First, you didn’t lose any real money.
Second, somebody else did. Third and most important, the investments that
interested you at the beginning of the watch period now cost less than they
did when you started watching. If you’re still convinced they are good invest-
ments, now might be the time to buy. Look at all the money you earned, just
by not investing until the price went down.
Creating your Watch List is easy
When you set up a Watch List, you can list securities that you own, securi-
ties that you want to own, securities that are similar to ones that interest
you, stock indexes, any type of investment that you want to monitor.
Here’s how to set up a Watch List in Quicken:
1. Open the Investing Center by clicking the Investing Center in the
Account Bar.
Make sure that the Today’s Data tab is selected.
2. Scroll down until the Watch List (Figure 4-4) appears at the bottom of
the screen.
Even if you have no securities in your Watch List, the list appears, ready
for you to populate.
3. Click the Add a Security button.
4. In the window that appears, enter the ticker symbol for the security
you want to track.
If you don’t know the ticker symbol, enter the name of the security (or
your best guess) and click the Look Up button. Quicken whisks you over
to Quicken.com, where a search for your security begins. If for some
reason (like you misspelled the name of the company or the company is
remarkably obscure) Quicken doesn’t find the security, go ahead and
search for the ticker symbol through other sources while you’re hanging
around on the Internet. A good place to look for ticker symbols beyond
Quicken is http://finance.yahoo.com/l (note that the last letter is
a lower case “L” and not a numeral “1”).
5. When you’ve got the ticker symbol, click Next.
Quicken hops online and finds out the name of your security and what
type of security it is. A little box appears, showing you what Quicken
found (see Figure 4-5).
6. Click Next to accept the security.
Make sure that the security Quicken found is the one you’re interested
in tracking. If the security that appears in the Add Security to Quicken
window is the wrong security, click Cancel and try again. If the correct

Quicken Watch Lists

security appears, click Next and Quicken adds the security to your
Watch List. A window appears asking if you want to do this again —
choose Yes or No, and then click Done.
When Quicken adds securities to your Watch List, the most recently avail-
able price quote is added as well. To get additional information, like an
updated price quote or the day’s price change and percentage change, click
your Download Quotes button at the top of the Investing Center.

So you’ve got a Watch List: Now What?
It’s time to dig around in your Watch List and see what kind of information
you can find about the securities that interest you:
✦For starters, click on any security in your Watch List. All the securities
are hyperlinked. Even clicking is a task with options. A quick click on
one of the securities opens a new window that displays securities details
such as the ticker symbol, the stock exchange where the security can be
found, the number of shares you own, if any, complete quote informa-
tion including highs, lows, trading volume, and all the technical informa-
tion that appears in the newspaper stock market quotes, as well as a
chart of the stock’s price and trading activity.
✦Before you click on a watch-listed security, let your mouse hover over
the security for a sec, and you see that you have a clicker’s choice of
asking for Quote or Chart. Pick Quote, and you see not only the quote
and trading volume info, but also the latest news headlines and links to
reports you can purchase, analyst’s opinions, company profile, and
information about the industry as a whole. Pick Chart, and you see a
Quick trick for adding securities to Watch List
If you have ever owned a security and recorded that security in Quicken, the name of the secu-

Open the security list by choosing Security List from the Investing menu or press Ctrl+Y (see the
following figure):
Click the box in the Watch column for any security that you want to add to your Watch List.
You can also quickly add any of the market indexes to your Watch List by clicking the Choose

the quote information that appeared over on the quote screen.
If you click on either the Chart or Quote selection, you get the full array
of clickable options provided by Yahoo! Finance. Along the left side of
the window that appears are hyperlinks that can display many different
types investment information for you, including
• Check out real-time quotes provided by Electronic Communication
Network, also known as ECN. ECN quotes are cherished by day-
traders, those investors who sit panting at the computer all day,
buying and selling hour after hour, and ensuring the success of com-
panies that manufacture coffee and other stimulants.
• Take a look at option prices. Hard-core traders like to buy and sell
the right to buy and sell securities at certain prices. The right to buy
at a certain price is called a call; the right to buy at a certain price is
called a put. Put them all together and it is called an option.
• Read the message board. Read what real people have to say about a
particular security. Sometimes this information is worthwhile; often
it is crazy personal comments. Always it’s fascinating or at last an
interesting way to pass some time. You can post your own messages
here, including inquiries. Warning: Don’t take the answers you get
too seriously.
• Look over SEC filings. Back to serious issues — get direct links to
actual reports that companies file with the Securities & Exchange
Commission.
• See what the competitors to your stock are doing. Find out who the
competition is for a particular company and how their stock is doing.
You might find some companies to add to your Watch List by check-
ing out the competition.
• Find out the analysts’ opinions. Read what the professional market-
watchers have to say about the securities.
• Research the owners. Find out who the primary stockholders are in
a particular company, how much stock they own, who has been
buying and selling, and how much.
• Review financial statements. See the most recent balance sheet,
income statement, and statement of cash flow for a particular security.
Tired of watching? Remove an item 
from the Watch List
It’s easy to take securities off of your Watch List. Simply click the Edit Watch
List button beneath the Watch List, and the entire list of your securities
appears. All securities you’re watching are marked with a little green check-
mark in the Watch column, as shown in Figure 4-6.

If tried-and-true, surefire ways to analyze the stock market and make invest-
ments that are successful every time existed, everyone who invested in
stocks would make a bundle of cash and be living on the proverbial easy
street.
If the Wall Street investment analysts, the people who get paid to analyze
stocks, can’t always figure out which companies are going to skyrocket and
which ones are going to tank, deciding for ourselves which investments to
pick is a daunting task, to say the least.
A plethora of information is available to you about investments that you own
and those you are watching. Quicken provides you with direct links to a
huge variety of information sources, and a quick Internet search will unearth
even more information. So what do you do with all this information?
Here’s my advice:
✦Read as much as you can so that you can speak knowledgeably about
the companies you invest in and those you’re considering investing in.
✦Follow the ups and downs of the stocks and funds that interest you,
trying to determine what conditions exist that have effects on the share
prices.
✦Watch. Use your Watch List to monitor your investments carefully and
constantly. Don’t just watch the stocks and funds you’re considering
purchasing; watch the ones you have already invested in. Don’t be afraid
to change your investment mix if it’s not working.
✦Wait. A stock or mutual worth investing in will continue to be worth
investing in as time goes by.
In my opinion, a lot of money is lost in the stock market by people trying to
jump in and invest as soon as they think an investment looks good, before
they take the time to watch and analyze. Time spent studying pays off with
sound investments based on knowledge, not whims.

I
n fiction, when people borrow money, a limb or a first-born child is often
on the line if the money isn’t paid back on time. Borrowing money in real
life isn’t nearly so scary. In fact, it’s the rare person in today’s society who
doesn’t borrow money. Automobile loans and home mortgages and college
loans seem like a way of life, and why shouldn’t they? Interest rates are
extremely low (at least compared to the late 70s and early 80s when mort-
gage interest rates hovered just under 20 percent), and Uncle Sam does his
best to make the interest on home mortgages and college loans an attractive
way of reducing federal income tax.
It Costs HOW MUCH to Borrow That Money?
The downside of borrowing money, aside from the fact that you have to pay
it back, is that you have to pay interest as well. The interest is a fee for the
privilege of borrowing the money.
Shopping around for the best loan deal
Interest rates vary based on several factors, some of which are in your con-
trol. Here are the different features that influence interest rates:
✦National economic factors. The U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate (the
rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans), and other fac-
tors that are completely out of your control, including the rate of infla-
tion, the stock market, the strength of the U.S. dollar against other
international currencies, the demand for money, the size of Abraham
Lincoln’s face on the $5 bill, and so on.

It Costs HOW MUCH to Borrow That Money?
258
✦Loan fees, or points, that you pay to the lender up front. The more
points you pay, the lower the interest rate on the loan. Points are fre-
quently offered on mortgage loans, and the IRS is often nice about letting
you deduct your points on your tax return.
✦Other banking relationships you have with your lender. If you have
accounts on deposit and other loans with your lender, you may be able
to negotiate a lower interest rate on a new loan.
✦Amount borrowed. Borrow less, and you might have more wiggle room
on the interest rate.
✦Loan term. Offer to shave a little time off your repayment schedule, and
you might be able to negotiate a lower interest rate. You might also have
a higher monthly payment, so be sure to weigh the pros and cons of
shortening your loan term.
✦Automatic payments. Some lenders will negotiate on the rate of interest
if you allow them to deduct payments automatically from your bank
account.
✦Your overall credit risk. This includes your level of income, your credit
history, your credit score, and your employment history, all of which
can affect the interest you pay.
If any of the above factors change during the life of your loan, you may be
able to refinance at a lower rate. For example, if you take steps to improve
your credit rating, or if you put money on deposit with the lender, check to
see if there is a possibility of restructuring your loan with lower interest.
There’s interest, and then there’s interest
Interest comes in many shapes and sizes. The way in which interest is com-
puted greatly affects the total amount you ultimately pay. Knowing the type
of interest you’re paying and how the interest is computed can impact deci-
sions about how you pay back your loan.
With simple interest, interest is calculated as a fixed amount, based on a
percentage of the loan amount, and the amount of interest is adjustable only
by the duration of the loan. So, for example, if you borrow $10,000 at 10 per-
cent interest for two years, the interest is 10 percent of $10,000, or $1,000,
per year, or $2,000 total. Pay the loan back a year early, and your interest is
cut to $1,000.
With compounding interest, the interest rate is recalculated after each pay-
ment, based on the remaining principal owing on the loan. Make extra
payments directly against principal and you can reduce the amount of inter-
est you owe on the loan and thus reduce the total amount you are required
to pay.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Borrowing Money
It Costs HOW MUCH to Borrow That Money?
259
When you create loans in Quicken, as demonstrated later in this chapter,
your interest is recorded as well as your principal payments. If you decide to
make early payments or other adjustments, be sure to adjust your records in
Quicken as well so that your payments are recorded properly.
Some loans don’t permit extra payments, otherwise known as prepayments,
of principal. If you think you might want to make extra payments in order to
reduce the amount of your interest, make sure your loan plan allows for
such payments. Some loans have a lock-out period in the early years, pre-
venting prepayments of principal, but then allowing such payments after a
certain amount of time has passed.
Borrowing money on the Internet 
Not too many years ago, the idea of borrowing money via the Internet would
have seemed as surreal as communicating with aliens on a UFO. Now, people
borrow money online frequently and easily. Many Web sites enable you to
compare rates from different lenders, not just in your area, but all across the
country. Many of the lenders even allow you to fill out an application right
from your computer.
Quicken offers mortgage and refinancing loan services at www.quickenloans
.com. Although Quicken.com doesn’t provide auto loans, the site recommends
the following for online automobile financing:
www.autobytel.com
www.carpoint.msn.com
www.carfinance.com
www.autoweb.com 
When considering taking advantage of the opportunity to borrow money
from an online source, keep in mind the following points:
✦Borrowing online is quick: You don’t have to go anywhere to meet with
a lender. The lending institution checks your credit reports instantly and
determines your creditworthiness right away.
✦Major banks are represented online: Familiar bank institutions have an
online presence and are available to loan money to new customers via
the Internet.
✦Security is crucial to conducting confidential business online: Bankers
and other lenders are aware of this and employ strict rules of encryp-
tion. Check the privacy notice of a potential lender for more information.
Encryption means that when you enter personal information on a Web page
and click Send, all of your letters and numbers are scrambled so that hack-
ers and other nefarious types can’t read them.

Using Quicken to Track Your Loans
260
Using Quicken to Track Your Loans
Quicken has the ability to keep track of all of your loans — not just how
much you owe, but how much you pay each month, how much of that pay-
ment is interest, and how much of that payment reduces the amount you
owe. (And how much of that payment should have been spent on useful
things like stale movie popcorn that comes slathered in something you
would never mistake for butter.)
You can use Quicken’s loan tracking features to prepare schedules of
deductible interest for your income tax return. You can also make extra 
payments of principal and recalculate your loan in Quicken.
Accountants use a fancy term, amortization, to signify the dispersion of loan
payments over the term of the loan. Breaking your big loan into little pay-
ments and spreading those payments over a period of time is called amortiz-
ing your loan.
Meet the Quicken Property & Debt Center
You might think we don’t care a lot about the property portion of the
Property & Debt Center in this chapter because we’re talking about borrow-
ing (debt). But actually, property often goes hand-in-hand with debt. You
take on debt so that you can acquire property. You get a mortgage so you
can have a home. You get a loan for your car. So it’s sensible to place infor-
mation about both the property you own and the debt you carry all in the
same place.
In the next section, you discover how to set up a loan in Quicken. Setting up
your loans is the first part of loan tracking in Quicken. The second part is
setting up your loan payments. By doing all of this setting-up stuff, your loan
payments get assigned to the correct loan, and you can always see how
much you have left to pay off on your loans.
You also find out how to link loans to property so that your Quicken account
provides a complete picture of not only what you owe but also what you own.
Adding a loan
You can either set up an existing loan or a new loan in Quicken. When you’re
ready to set up a loan in Quicken, follow these steps:
You don’t get a leave-and-come-back option with Quicken’s loan setup
wizard. If you have to cut and run before you’ve entered all of your loan
information, click Cancel and plan on starting over later.

1. Click on Property & Debt Center on your Account Bar, and then click
Add Loan near the bottom of the page.
Alternatively, you can choose Loans from the Property & Debt menu, or
press Ctrl+H, and then when the View Loans window appears, click the
New option at the top of the window. Either way, a Loan Setup wizard
pops up onscreen (see Figure 1-1).
2. With the EasyStep tab selected, click Next to get into the heart of the
Loan Setup wizard.
Quicken asks a bunch of questions in the wizard, designed to get you to
give up all the information you can find or remember about your loan. 
If you don’t have the loan documentation at your fingertips and can’t
remember all the particulars, no worries. You can go back and change
your information later (see “Making changes in your loan” later in this
chapter).
If you’re comfortable with loan lingo and want to cut to the chase, click
the Summary tab in the Loan Setup wizard. Here you can fill in the
blanks with your loan information and save yourself time and clicking
effort.
3. Indicate if you are borrowing money or lending money in this particu-
lar loan, and then click Next.
Loans work two ways. Depending on which road you choose, Quicken
sets up loan accounts and classifies them property, treating a loan you
make as a receivable (an amount you’ll ultimately get back, someday,
you hope, that is if you can find your brother who was last seen driving
west toward Omaha), and treating a loan you borrow as a payable, an
amount you have to return. For this example you’re borrowing money.

4. Give this loan a name and click the ubiquitous Next button.
Pet names like Muffy, Fluffy, and Rin Tin Tin don’t necessarily capture
the essence of the loan (unless of course you’re borrowing money on
behalf of your pet), so think of something a bit more succinct, such as
Auto Loan or Mortgage or Loan to Sister. I’m using Auto Loan for this
example. If you prefer, you can click Existing Account and then choose
from the accounts listed. If this is the first time you’ve entered loan
information, you’ll probably use the New Account option.
5. Let Quicken know if you’ve already made payments on this loan and
then click Next again.
If you coordinate starting a loan with setting up Quicken, the setup
process is a bit less messy. If you already had a loan when you decided
to set the loan up in Quicken, that’s OK. You just need to be ready to
enter information like how much you’ve already paid on the loan so that
Quicken can keep up with you from now until the payoff day. For this
example, I pick Yes and say I’ve already made some payments, so you
can see how to enter existing loan information into Quicken.
6. Enter the starting date of the loan and the original amount you bor-
rowed, and then click Next.
Now it’s time to start racking your brain. Again, don’t forget that you can
change loan information later if you don’t quite remember everything
now. Enter the starting date, or a close approximation of when you bor-
rowed the money, as I’ve done in Figure 1-2, and then enter the initial
amount of the loan.
7. Answer the Balloon Payment question, and then click Next.
Some loans come with an option called the balloon payment. This doesn’t
mean your money drifts up into the stratosphere, although it may feel
that way. Actually, what happens is you get lower monthly payments up
front with a guarantee that you’ll pay a big payment at the end. Often
these loans are structured so that you pay only interest for your monthly
loan payments, and then pay the entire principal at the end of the loan.
Many people take out these types of loans with a plan to refinance the
principal when the balloon payment is due.
8. Enter the length of the loan.
Your options here are years, months, weeks, and payments. Payments?
Sometimes loans are set up based on the number of payments you’re
going to make, instead of a fixed time period. For this example, I’ve
selected a four-year loan.
If your loan is a 4-year loan, payable in 48 monthly payments, it doesn’t
matter if you select 4 years or 48 months for the length of the loan. You
get to specify that your payments are monthly for either entry.

Book IV
Chapter 1

9. Enter the payment period.
Here’s where you specify how frequently the payments are going to be
made. Even if you plan to make extra payments in order to get this over
with quickly, or even if, heaven forbid, you end up missing payments,
just enter the frequency that the lender expects for your payments.
10. Enter the compounding period.
You must tell Quicken about the compounding period for your loan so
that Quicken can accurately calculate the interest. Your loan document
should specify the compounding period, and your lender should cer-
tainly be able to tell you. For this example, I’ve entered a monthly com-
pounding period.
Interest that is calculated on not just the principal of the loan but on
unpaid and accrued interest as well is called compound interest.
11. Enter the current balance of the loan.
If you know the current balance of your loan, answer Yes when asked
about this, and then enter the balance as of today’s date. You can call
your lender to find out this amount. You can also decide not to worry
about entering the current balance and just answer No when Quicken
asks if you know your loan balance. If you don’t enter the balance,
Quicken does the calculations and tells you what your balance is.
Quicken’s calculation may be off a few pennies due to some rounding,
but you can make changes later.
12. Enter the date of your next payment and the amount.
Enter the date your next payment is due, even if that date might not
agree with the date on which you actually plan to make the payment.
Enter the amount of your payment as shown in Figure 1-3. If you’re 
not sure of the amount, just look back in your checkbook or at your 
Figure 1-2:
Fill in the
blanks
about your
loan.

cancelled checks or bank statement to see how much you’re paid previ-
ously. If haven’t made any payments yet, you can find the payment
amount on your loan papers.
Entering the loan payment can get tricky when you are setting up a
mortgage. Mortgage payments usually include odds and ends like real
estate tax, homeowner’s insurance, and private mortgage insurance.
Quicken only wants to hear about your principal and interest — the rest
of those items get added later. You might have to get out some of your
loan papers to find out how much of the payment is just loan principal
and interest.
Entering principal and interest for your loan payment means entering
all principal and interest. If you are the type of person that typically
pays extra principal with your loan payment, enter that extra amount in
addition to the requirement payment amount in the window shown at
Figure 1-3. Quicken can then calculate accurately how early your loan is
going to be paid off due to your extra payments.
13. Enter your interest rate.
Back to the loan papers, or call your lender. Either one can tell you what
rate of interest you are paying on this loan.
Sometimes the loan papers for loans with compounding interest show
not only the basic interest rate but also the compounded interest rate.
Make sure you enter only the basic interest rate in Quicken.
14. Review the summary and click Done when you are finished.
Clicking Next after you enter your interest rate takes you to the
Summary tab, where you can review all of the information you just
Figure 1-3:
Enter only
the amount
you pay for
principal
and interest.

entered. Click Next a couple of times to get through the summary
screens. Make any changes that might be necessary if you entered infor-
mation incorrectly, and then click Done to save your loan information.
The Set Up Loan Payment window appears. In the “Looking at your
loans,” sidebar, I discuss your options for setting up your loan payment
in Quicken.
Setting up your loan payments in Quicken
Immediately after you set up a loan in Quicken, the Set Up Loan Payment
window appears. You don’t have to set up your loan payment in Quicken,
but if you want Quicken to keep track of your loan balance, you should set
up the payment. Otherwise, why did you go through all of the steps to set up
your loan?
Looking at your loans
Care to take a quick look at the details of the
loans you set up in Quicken? Hop over to the
View Loans window, where all at once you can
see the principal, payment amount, interest
rate, and term for every loan you have, make
changes in the loan information, edit the pay-
ment details, order up a payment, and see and
print a complete payment schedule. Talk about
full service!
To open the View Loans window, choose Loans
from the Property & Debt menu, or press Ctrl+H.
When you click Loans (or do a Ctrl+H), the View
Loans window appears. If you’ve already set up
a loan in Quicken, the information about that
loan is accessible in this window. If you have
not set up any loans yet, don’t bother with this
because there’s nothing to see in this window.
Choose the loan whose details you want to
view by clicking the Choose Loan drop-down
list at the top of the window and clicking on the
appropriate loan.
The Loan Summary tab shows the date you
entered for the start of the loan, the loan’s
opening balance, your payment amount, the
term, and the interest rate.
Click the Payment Schedule tab to see your
complete payment schedule, otherwise known
as your amortization schedule. This schedule
shows all of your payments, the due dates, and
the breakdown of principal and interest.
The payment amount on the loan payment
schedule only reflects principal and interest. If
your loan payment includes other amounts,
such as property tax or homeowner’s insur-
ance, those amounts are not reflected in the
table.
Click the Payment Graph if you are interested
in seeing a line graph representing the amount
of principal and interest you have paid and will
pay on the loan.
Use the buttons on the right side of the window
to make changes in the loan or payment infor-
mation, make a payment, or change the inter-
est rate. These features are described in the
section later in this chapter called, “Making
changes in your loan.”

Meet the Quicken Property & Debt Center
266
When the Set Up Loan Payment window materializes, follow these steps to
set up your loan payment.
1. Make sure the interest rate and the loan payment amount are correct.
If necessary, you can edit the interest and loan payment amounts while
you’re hanging around in the loan payment setup window. But these
amounts come from the loan setup information, so they are probably
correct.
2. Enter other amounts that are part of your loan payment.
Here’s where you get to enter the homeowner’s insurance, private mort-
gage insurance (PMI), and real estate tax, and any other payments that
you make with your regular loan payment. Click the little Edit button if
you need to add additional payment information. A Split Transaction
window appears. You can list each additional expense that is part of
your loan payment, and then click OK to close the window and return 
to the setup window.
Private Mortgage Insurance, known to its friends as PMI, is an insurance
payment that your lender tacks on to your mortgage payments when
your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price or
appraised value of your home. The lender’s concern is that if you default
on your loan, the lender may not be able to sell the house for enough 
to recoup the entire loan. Thus, the insurance is there to protect the
lender. As soon as you’ve paid enough so that your remaining mortgage
balance is under the 20 percent of value threshold, you can request that
the PMI payments be terminated.
3. Select the payment type.
In the Type field (see Figure 1-4), choose between Payment (you write
the check, and then enter it in Quicken), Print Check (issue and print a
check within Quicken), and Online Pmt (online payment).
Figure 1-4:

4. Set up a scheduled payment (optional).
If you are interested in automating the payment process, now’s your
chance. (If you are not going to use the scheduled payment feature, skip
to step 5.) Click on the Payment Method button. The Select Payment
Method window appears.
• Click on Scheduled Transaction.
• In the Register Entry field, identify when or how you want Quicken to
enter this transaction in your register. Prompt Before Entering means
you receive an alert telling you Quicken is ready to enter this trans-
action. Automatically Enter means you don’t have to take any action
at all to have Quicken automatically enter the transaction in your
register.
• Choose the account from which the payment is to be made.
• Indicate how many days before the due date you want Quicken to
prompt you or to enter this transaction. Then click OK.
5. Enter the name of the payee.
6. Enter an optional memo.
7. Enter the date of the next payment.
8. Enter the category where you want Quicken to enter your interest
expense.
9. Enter an address for automatic payments.
If Quicken is to issue a check for this payment, click the Address button
and verify the name and enter the address of the payee.
You can click the Pay Now button if you’re anxious to get a payment
made right away. Otherwise, click the OK button and the Set Up Loan
Payment window closes.
You now have an opportunity to enter asset information to go with this loan.
Remember? This is the property part of the Property & Debt center. Clicking
Yes in the box shown in Figure 1-5 takes you to the Account Setup window,
where you enter the name of the asset, the date you acquired the asset, and
the cost.
Figure 1-5:

link that

Meet the Quicken Property & Debt Center
268
Personally, I prefer not to associate an asset with a loan at the time I’m setting
up the loan. Here’s why. When you agree to associate an asset with the loan,
you get to enter the name of the asset, the date acquired, and the cost. If
instead, you wait and click Add Account in the Property & Debt Center, you
get to add more detailed information. For example, if you’re setting up a car
in Quicken, you get to enter information like the make and model and year.
And you still get to associate the car with the loan. Maybe it doesn’t matter
which way you enter the asset; it’s just my personal preference to set up the
asset separately.
Making changes in your loan
Here are a few reasons why you might want to make changes to your loan:
✦You made a mistake with the original information you entered.
✦The interest rate has changed.
✦The loan was sold or turned over to a new financial institution, so you
need to change the name of the payee.
✦You decide to make a change in the way in which you’ve been paying the
loan. For example, maybe you want more notice before the payment is
posted to your Quicken register, or maybe you want to switch from writ-
ing checks to automatic payments.
It’s easy to change your loan information:
1. Click on the Property & Debt Center.
2. Scroll down to the Loan Accounts Summary section so that you can
see the loan you want to edit.
3. Right-click on the loan and choose Edit This Loan from the pop-up
menu.
Be sure to right-click on the loan as it appears in the Loan Accounts
Summary and not the loan that appears in your Debt (Liabilities) sum-
mary. Even though the two items represent the same loan, you don’t get
to edit as many facets of the loan if you choose the loan account in the
Debt section.
4. On the screen that appears, you can change any of the information
about the loan.
If you need to change the current balance of the loan, click on the loan’s
hyperlink in the Property & Debt center. The loan register appears. You
can click on the Overview tab and then click on the Current Balance. A
window appears (see Figure 1-6), where you can make an adjustment to
the current balance.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Borrowing Money
Meet the Quicken Property & Debt Center
269
If you’re changing the loan’s current balance, enter the new amount as a pos-
itive number, even though the loan amount actually appears on the Overview
tab as a negative number.
The last payment: Removing a loan from Quicken
It’s not unusual for the last payment of a loan to be slightly different from the
rest of the payments you’ve made. Either there is a slight rounding differ-
ence on the last payment, or perhaps you want to consolidate the last
couple of payments and get the loan over with.
You can change the amount of your loan payment by clicking on the Make a
Payment button in the Loan Accounts Summary section of the Property &
Debt Center. When the View Loans window appears, click the Edit Payment
button.
When the Edit Loan Payment window appears (Figure 1-7), enter the amount
of your payment. If you’re ready to make the payment now, click Pay Now.
Verify the amount and the bank account you are using, and then click OK to
record the payment.

field.

270
If you want to pay later instead, click OK in the Edit Loan Payment window
and the amount you entered takes the place of your next scheduled payment.
There’s no need to remove the paid-off loan from your account list. Quicken
takes care of zeroing out the loan balance.
After you’ve paid off your loan, be sure to open the Scheduled Transactions
List (Ctrl+J), click on the scheduled loan payment, and then click the Delete
button at the top of the screen, so that Quicken won’t make any more pay-
ments on your behalf!
More loan fun: Refinancing your loan
It’s not uncommon for people to refinance their loans. Usually it’s mortgages
that are refinanced. Often the reason for refinancing is the opportunity to
lock in a lower interest rate and produce lower monthly payments. Here are
some other reasons for refinancing:
✦When you have accumulated equity in your home, you can refinance to
increase your loan and borrow some of the home’s equity as cash.
✦If you have an adjustable interest rate on your home and want to lock in
a fixed rate, you can refinance at a fixed interest rate.
✦Some people refinance their home loan as a means of consolidating
debt. They borrow more against their home and use that money to pay
off other debts.
✦Although you can usually make extra payments on a loan in order to
pay the loan off sooner, you can also refinance and restructure the loan
so that it is payable in a shorter time period. Lenders sometimes offer
a reduced interest rate if you reduce the term of the loan when you
refinance.
✦If your credit wasn’t stellar when you first borrowed money, you proba-
bly had to agree to a higher interest rate than you might have with
better credit. But after you’ve built up a good credit history, you can
look into refinancing in order to get a lower interest rate.
✦You might have borrowed heavily when you purchased your home and
as a result had to pay private mortgage insurance. If now you have more
money that you can put down with a loan, you can refinance and do
away with the private mortgage insurance.
When you refinance a loan, you pay off the original loan and borrow a new
loan. Even though there are two separate loans, typically the transaction is
all done at once; the old loan is retired and the new loan is entered into in
one session.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Borrowing Money
Meet the Quicken Property & Debt Center
271
In Quicken, you need to transfer the balance of the old loan into the new
loan in order to record the refinancing property. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Choose Loans from the Property & Debt menu, or press Ctrl+H.
The View Loans window appears.
2. Click the New button.
The Loan Setup wizard appears onscreen, ready for you to enter the
information about your new loan. Be sure to have all of your loan docu-
mentation with you so you can fill in the blanks properly.
3. Enter the information about your new loan, just as you did in the sec-
tion, “Adding a loan,” earlier in this chapter.
Don’t bother trying to attach your asset to this new loan at this time. For
example, if you are refinancing a mortgage loan, your house is already
tied to the previous mortgage loan and, in this screen, Quicken won’t let
you tie the same asset to two loans. Be patient. You link the loan and the
house together in a few more steps.
4. After your loan is added, go to the Property & Debt center and click
on the new loan.
The register for that loan appears.
5. Go to the split screen for the new loan’s opening balance.
Click on the opening balance transaction in the new loan’s register (the
first transaction). If you see the Split button, click it. If you’ve turned off
the use of these buttons, press Ctrl+S to open the Split Transaction
window.
If those Enter/Edit/Split buttons bug you (or if you wonder where they
went), control their appearance by choosing Preferences from the Edit
menu, and then choosing Quicken Program. Click the Register option on
the left side of the Quicken Preferences window, and then either check
or uncheck the box for Show Transaction Toolbar.
6. Enter the breakdown of how the new loan money is distributed, as
shown in Figure 1-8.
Enter the payoff amount for the old loan and enter any other expenses
you paid at the refinancing meeting, such as loan interest or other fees.
If you received cash, enter the amount you received and the account
where it was deposited. When all amounts have been added (you’ll see
that the Remainder amount at the bottom of the window has turned to
zero), click OK to close the Split Transaction window.

Meet the Quicken Property & Debt Center
272
Don’t forget to record the transaction by pressing or clicking Enter. Until
you record the transaction, none of the amounts get disbursed to the
appropriate categories.
7. Return to the Property & Debt Center.
Now you can see that the old mortgage balance has been replaced with a
zero. You could delete this mortgage, but because there are transactions
associated with the old mortgage, I recommend keeping it around. By
leaving the zero-ed out mortgage on the list of loans, you can always
click on that old mortgage and see the detail of all of your previous trans-
actions. You never know when you’ll need to look up an old transaction.
8. Attach your asset to the new loan.
Because the example I’m using here is a mortgage refinancing, we need
to attach the house to the new mortgage. Here’s how:
1. Open the Account List by pressing Ctrl+A.
2. Click on your new loan.
3. Click the Edit button at the top of the Account List.
4. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Linked Asset Account field
(see Figure 1-9).
5. Choose the house that should be attached to this loan.
6. Click OK.

Using Quicken’s Loan Calculator
I love the loan calculator. I use it any time I’m thinking about borrowing
money for any reason. Sometimes I just use it for fun. You can enter any type
of loan scenario and Quicken tells you how much your payments are going
to be, how long it is going to take you to pay off a loan, and how much inter-
est you are going to pay. You can print out an amortization schedule showing
the detail of all of your payments. This is a wonderful tool and it’s really easy
to use.
Here’s how the loan calculator works:
1. Go to the Planning menu and choose Financial Calculators➪Loan
Calculator.
2. Decide if you want Quicken to tell you how much you can afford to
borrow (Loan Amount) or how much your payments will be (Payment
Per Period).
Click the appropriate option in the Calculate For area of the Loan
Calculator window (see Figure 1-10). For this example, I’ve indicated 
that I want Quicken to calculate the payment for me.
3. Fill in the blanks, entering the amount you want to borrow, the inter-
est rate, the number of years and number of payments per year, and
how interest is to be compounded.
For this example, I’ve indicated that I want to borrow $5,000 and pay it
back monthly over four years, with monthly compounding. Quicken tells
me I can expect to pay $122.06 per month.
Figure 1-9:

Click the Calculate button to have Quicken recalculate the loan when
you make a change in one of the fields. Actually, all you have to do is
make your change, and click in any other field, and Quicken automati-
cally recalculates the loan information.
4. View the details of your loan by clicking on the Schedule button.
A payment schedule appears as shown in Figure 1-11, displaying the
breakdown of the payments you would make to pay back this hypotheti-
cal loan.
5. When the payment schedule is displayed, click Print in the top-left
corner of the schedule to print a paper copy of the required payments.

Quicken’s little payment schedule doesn’t include totals. But it’s an easy task
to determine how much the total interest burden is going to be on the loan.
For this example, Quicken already told us we’re to pay back $122.06 per
month for 48 months. Multiply that payback amount by 48 and you get
$5,858.88. Subtract the principal, $5,000, and you’re left with $858.88. That’s
how much interest you’ll pay on this particular loan.
Now, switch the scenario. This time, say you know you can afford to pay
$200 per month for four years, and you’d like to know how much you can
afford to borrow at 8 percent. Change the Calculate For field to Loan
Amount, and fill in the blanks, as shown in Figure 1-12. The calculated
amount you can borrow is $8,192.38.
Pull up the loan calculator any time you’re contemplating borrowing money.
Quicken can help you figure out what you can borrow and what you have to
pay, so you won’t have any surprises when you visit the lender.
The Loan Calculator works both ways. Not only can you use this tool to help
figure out your own borrowing needs, but you can also use the calculator to
determine the correct payback amount if you’re contemplating loaning
money to someone else. You can then print the payment schedule so your
borrower has the detail supporting all of the payments.

t’s the rare wallet that doesn’t contain a credit card, and we find it diffi-
cult to imagine life without credit. But credit cards have only been in exis-
tence for a short while. The first credit card was created in 1950 — a Diners
Club card. Prior to that time, people still bought furniture and took trips and
ate meals in restaurants and rented cars and did all the other things they
can do today with credit cards (except maybe open locked doors), and
somehow everyone seemed to manage. Today, credit cards are a part of
your personal financial picture and should be accounted for just like your
bank accounts. In this chapter, you find out how easy it is to keep track of
your credit card charges in Quicken.
Setting Up Your Credit Card
Before you can start monitoring your credit card charges in Quicken, you
must first set up the credit card account. With the account in place, you can
then track all of your transactions, thus helping you keep track of your charge
expenditures and also making your reports more complete and accurate.
When your credit card statement comes in the mail, it’s easy to balance the
statement and compare your statement activity with the activity you’ve
recorded in Quicken.
See Book II, Chapter 3 for step-by-step instructions for setting up any credit
card in Quicken.
You might choose to acquire a Quicken credit card, a card issued by
Citibank for Intuit customers. See “Applying for a Quicken credit card”
below for more information on this option.

Tracking Your Credit Card Charges in Quicken
278
Tracking Your Credit Card Charges in Quicken
Tracking the charges you make on your credit card is easy and fun! At least,
it’s pretty easy as long as you hold on to your credit card receipts, and it’s
even fun if you’re the sort of person who rolls your socks together in match-
ing pairs instead of just tossing them all into the sock drawer without mates.
To enter your credit card charges in Quicken as you make the charges, you
need a method for transferring information from your charge receipts to
your Quicken account. This is an easy task if you have a manageable number
of charge receipts. Here are some suggestions for simplifying the task of
entering charge receipts in Quicken:
✦As you collect charge receipts, save them all in the same place, such as
your billfold, a box or basket on your desk, a manila folder or envelope.
Try to avoid using the vast array of less organized places such as car
glove compartments, pockets in jackets and other clothing, purses,
backpacks, and so on. It’s easier to retrieve receipts if you have a spe-
cific credit card receipt place.
✦At the end of each day, or once a week, or whenever it works best in
your schedule (schedule is the operative word), enter all of your receipts
in your Quicken credit card register. In the best of all worlds, you should
then hold on to your receipts until the statement arrives in case there
are any discrepancies. Discrepancies might not happen often, but it’s not
impossible that the restaurant cashier misread the handwritten tip you
wrote on a restaurant receipt. It’s also possible you might need to return
an item, and receipts always come in handy in those situations.
Applying for a Quicken credit card
Some credit card companies cooperate with
Quicken and allow you access to your state-
ment online. Or, you can just get your credit
card from Quicken and ensure that all of the
online access is in place.
Quicken credit card users enjoy the ability to

Tracking Your Credit Card Charges in Quicken
279
✦At the very least, before you toss a credit card receipt or before you
forget that you made a charge, enter the charge in Quicken so you’ll
have a record of the charge.
✦Or, none of the above. If you prefer, you can just wait until your credit
card statement arrives and enter all the charges right off your statement
into Quicken without double-checking the charges against the actual
receipts. I don’t recommend this method, but it does work. Note that I’m
not advocating the method of simply recording your credit card pay-
ments as credit card expenses without breaking out the expenses to
their appropriate categories. It’s impossible to budget properly or moni-
tor your spending in any of your spending categories if you simply
account for the credit card expense as a miscellaneous expense.
When you enter your charge receipts in Quicken, the amounts you enter are
immediately incorporated into any reports that you produce, if those reports
include your credit card expenses. So, if you enter charges when they occur,
even if you haven’t gotten your credit card bill yet, when you produce a
report of your restaurant expenses for the month or your automobile gas
expenses, your information is completely current including all the latest
charges.
Enter your current charge receipts in Quicken by following these steps:
1. Open the register for your credit card.
Press Ctrl+A to display the Account List. Then double-click on the credit
card name (or click once on the account name and click the Go To
option at the top of the Account List) to display the register. Note: 
This step assumes you have already set up your credit card account in
Quicken.
2. Enter the date of your first charge.
Either type the date in mmddyy format (Quicken automatically inserts
slashes), or click the little calendar to the right of the date field and then
click on a date to select it. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts
(described in Book II, Chapter 1) to speed up the date entry. Press Tab
to move to the next field.
It doesn’t matter if you enter your credit card charges out of order.
Quicken automatically re-sorts the register in date order as you make
your entries.
3. Enter an optional reference.
In the field marked Ref, you can enter a reference of your choice, up to
twelve characters, letters or numbers accepted. Or you can leave the
field blank.

Tracking Your Credit Card Charges in Quicken
280
4. Enter the Payee in the Payee field.
Payee is the name of the business that accepted your charge. Usually
the name is printed somewhere on the charge receipt.
Sometimes the name of the payee has nothing to do with the name of
the place where you thought you were making the charge, which can
make it difficult to reconcile your account when you get a statement that
shows you made a purchase at Senator Sam’s Exports and you actually
bought tickets to the Celtics game. Keeping your receipts at least until
your statement arrives is one way to make sure the amounts you
charged are the same amounts that appear on your statement.
5. Enter the charge amount.
As you can see in Figure 2-1, there are two amount columns in your
credit card register: Charge and Payment. The Charge column is where
you enter amounts you’ve charged on your card. If you receive a credit
or refund on your credit card, that amount goes in the Payment column,
as do any payments you make.
6. Enter the category.
Each charge needs to be associated with a category. That way, Quicken
knows where to classify the amount when preparing reports. Choose the
category that is most appropriate, and create a new category if you can’t
find a category that describes this charge (see in Book II, Chapter 1 for
more on how). If your charge is for amounts that should be recorded in
multiple categories, use the Split Category feature (Ctrl+S) to list each of
the charge amounts and their respective categories.
Figure 2-1:
Enter
amounts in
the Charge
column.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using a Credit Card
Account
Tracking Your Credit Card Charges in Quicken
281
The categories you set up in one account are accessible by all of your
Quicken accounts, so when you display your category list or begin
typing a category name, you see that a category you’ve used before is
available to you now as well. The same goes for payees — the QuickFill
feature fills in the name of a payee you’ve encountered in a different
account as soon as you begin typing the payee name.
7. Enter a description.
Some expenses are obvious and a description isn’t necessary. But for
certain expenses, such as those where the reason for the charge isn’t
obvious, or for tax-related charges where you want to record informa-
tion that will be useful in your tax return preparation, you can enter a
short memo description with information about the charge.
8. Click or press Enter to record the transaction.
Note: Your credit card account carries a negative balance because this is
an amount you owe instead of an amount you own, so don’t be alarmed
when you see the red number in the balance column.
If you’re the type of person who likes to keep your receipts for longer than
just the current billing cycle, consider setting up a place where you can store
an envelope or file folder for each month’s receipts, or staple the receipts for
one month on a piece of paper, and then file the paper or envelope with the
credit card statement for that month.
Tracking your debit card charges in Quicken
Debit cards look just like credit cards, and most
of the time they are used just like credit cards.
The big difference between debit cards and
credit cards is that amounts charged on your
debit card are applied immediately to the bal-
ance in your bank account, and you don’t have
to pay against an invoice from the credit card
company each month.
Instead of getting a separate statement from a
credit card company, your debit card charges
are recorded on your regular bank statement,
ready to be reconciled each month along with
the rest of your bank account activity.
If you use a debit card and if you are the type
of person who is very detail-oriented, you
probably like to enter in Quicken each debit
card charge you make, as soon as you make it.
By entering your transactions in a timely
manner, your checking account balance in
Quicken is always accurate.
Debit charges reduce your bank account bal-
ance as soon as you make the charge, so while
you might use the card in a fashion similar to
the way in which you use your credit card, the
debit card is actually an extension of your
checking account. When you reconcile your
checking account, you must include your debit
card activity.

Balancing Your Credit Card Account
282
You must save the receipts that support expenses you plan to deduct on
your income tax return. Be sure to write pertinent information on the back of
the receipt or on the paper to which the receipt is stapled. Information such
as explanation of the charge, business purpose, and the name of the person
you were with will help you justify the deduction should a tax authority
examine your tax return.
Balancing Your Credit Card Account
Each month, you receive a statement from the credit card company showing
you all of the charges you made during the month, any payments you made
within the last month, and the amount of finance charge that the credit card
company has assessed against you.
It is your job to balance this credit card statement, comparing your actual
charges to the credit card charges and entering the information in Quicken.
When you get your statement in the mail, you should begin the reconcilia-
tion process by first making sure that you have entered all of the credit card
charges that you made in the past month into your credit card register, as
described earlier in this chapter. Having all of your charge information
already entered in your Quicken register speeds up the reconciliation
process considerably.
To balance (reconcile) your credit card account when your statement
arrives, follow these steps:
1. Open your credit card register in Quicken and open the reconciliation
window.
Go to the Account List by pressing Ctrl+A, and then double-click on 
the credit card account for which you have received a statement. The
account register appears. Click the Reconcile button at the top, and the
Statement Summary window appears (see Figure 2-2).
2. Fill in the blanks, entering the amounts from your credit card
statement.
Notice that you are required to enter amounts in all of the fields —
Quicken won’t let you leave blanks. If your statement doesn’t reflect any
charges or if you didn’t make a payment last month, those amounts are
zero on your statement and you should enter corresponding zeros in the
reconciliation window.
3. Click OK to proceed to the main reconciliation window.

Book IV
Chapter 2

Account

283
4. Check off all charges that match the charges on your statement.
The charges listed on the main reconciliation window are the charges
you listed in your Quicken register. If you haven’t listed any charges in
your register, nothing is listed in this window. Click on a charge to indi-
cate a match. A checkmark appears in the Clr column. You can also
arrow to the charge and press Enter to check off the item.
5. Correct any discrepancies.
The charge you listed in your Quicken register might not agree with the
charge that appears on the statement. If the amounts differ, first deter-
mine which amount is correct. Don’t automatically assume the state-
ment is right — here’s where it’s really useful to go back to your charge
receipt and verify the amount that you authorized. If you entered an
amount in your register incorrectly, you can easily change your amount
by clicking on the item in the register and then clicking the Edit option
at the top of the reconciliation window.
6. Edit a transaction.
When you get back to the register, enter the correct amount. If you 
use the transaction toolbar in the register, you can click the Return to
Reconcile option, as you can see in Figure 2-3. Click Yes when asked if
you want to save the transaction. If you have turned off the transaction
toolbar, press Enter to save your changes, and then you can click the
Statement Summary button at the bottom of your register window, or
the Reconcile button at the top. Either one gets you back to the business
of reconciling.
You might have entered a charge transaction twice in your register. If
you see a duplicate entry when you’re reconciling, click on one of the
duplicate entries, and then click the Delete button at the top of the rec-
onciliation window. Click Yes in the window that appears to confirm that
you want to delete the transaction. Bye-bye, duplicate transaction.

7. Continue matching your recorded activity to the statement.
Match the rest of your charges and any payments you made or credits
you received, until everything on the statement has been checked off. If
some items on the statement weren’t recorded in your Quicken register,
click the New option to return to the register to enter additional trans-
actions. Your goal is to get to a difference of zero at the bottom-right
corner of the reconciliation window (see Figure 2-4).

8. Complete the reconciliation.
Click Finished when you’re done matching all the items in your reconcili-
ation. Click Finish Later if you’re not done but you have to cut out. Click
Cancel if you want to close the reconciliation and not save any of the
checkmarks you entered. When you return, you have to start over again.
9. Indicate if you want to make a credit card payment.
When the credit card reconciliation is complete, a window appears
(Figure 2-5) giving you the opportunity to make or record a payment.
Click No if you’re not interested. If you’re ready to make a payment, first
indicate from which account the money is to be drawn. Then choose
whether you plan to print a check in Quicken, write a check by hand, or
make an online payment (the online option only works if your account is
set up for online activity). Click Yes when you’ve entered your choices.
10. Fix the payment amount.
Quicken automatically assumes you’re going to pay the entire amount.
So when your register appears showing the amount of the check you’re
going to write by hand, or when a check window appears showing the
amount of the check you’re going to write in Quicken, or when an online
payment window appears showing the amount you’re going to transfer
from your bank account, double-check the amount and make any neces-
sary corrections. When you’re certain the amount is correct, record the
transaction.
Be careful when recording credit card payments, especially where electronic
payments are concerned. If you click mindlessly, you might find yourself
paying off the entire balance of your credit card even though you only meant
to make a minimum payment.
Figure 2-5:

Balancing Your Credit Card Account
286
Borrowing money from your credit card
Credit card companies are not just in the business of fronting the money
for your charges. Often these companies send loan offers in the mail, in the
form of blank checks that you can write as if they are your own personal
checks — except that you don’t have to worry about having the money.
(No, seriously, you do have to worry about having the money to cover the
credit card checks — just not today.)
Writing a check from your credit card is like making another charge. The
amount should be recorded in the charge column of your register, just as if
you were paying for a bucket of chicken or a car rental.
And speaking of car rentals, sometimes when you make certain types of
charges, you are required to record a deposit. For example, you might rent a
car and the car rental company charges your credit card for a $150 deposit.
Be sure to set up a category to track deposits, so that you can monitor them
and make sure the money is returned to you. In the case of a car rental, the
deposit should be credited back to your account when you return the car, or
applied as a price reduction to the rental. By categorizing your deposits in a
separate account, you’re more likely to remember them and follow up on
any deposits not reimbursed.
Changing your credit limit
The better a customer you are (defined by credit card companies as some-
one who carries lots of credit and makes at least the minimum payment but
not much more than that on time each month), the more likely it is that the
credit card company is going to increase your credit limit.
You can, of course, choose to use this new higher credit limit, or you can
continue operating as if the old credit limit is still in force. If you decide to
tell Quicken about the new limit, and thus avoid getting disturbing little mes-
sages telling you you’ve overspent your limit, you can enter the new limit in
your Quicken program by following these easy steps:
1. Open the account list (Ctrl+A) and click once on your credit card
account to select the account.
2. Click the Edit button at the top of the window, and the Account Details
window appears (see Figure 2-6).
Alternatively, you can click the Edit Account button.

Credit cards and finance charges
Some credit card companies offer lower inter-
est rates if you transfer balances from another
credit card to a new account. And if you write a
check to borrow cash against your credit card,
that amount can often be borrowed at a rate 
different — and usually higher — from the inter-
est assessed on your regular charge activity.
Trying to figure out the calculation of your
finance charge on your monthly statement can
turn into a regular nightmare when two or three
interest rates are in use.
And here are some other finance charge issues
to keep in mind. Each credit card company has
different terms, so get out the magnifying glass
and read the fine print. Here are some details
you might see:
 Penalties for late payments: Don’t miss the
due date or your credit card company
might assess another finance charge in
addition to the regular interest you pay on
unpaid balances. And it’s not just your
credit card payment that you have to make
on time. If you make a late payment on your
mortgage, your car loan, or any other debt
that appears on your credit report, that can
trigger an increase in your finance charge
rate by your credit card company.
 Minimum charge: Some credit cards assess
a minimum finance charge even if you pay
your balance on time every month.
 Extra fees for exceeding credit limit: The
credit limit is your ceiling. Go up on the roof
with your charges and you might get hit
with additional finance charges.
 How your payment is applied: If you have
different interest rates in force for different
amounts owing on your credit card, the
credit card company will probably apply
your payments to the amounts with the
lowest interest rate first, keeping the higher
rate compounding longer on the other
charges. One way to avoid this lack of
control over how your payments are applied
is to use different credit cards for different
types of credit; that way, if you want to
make extra payments, you can target the
card with the highest interest rate.
 Increasing rates: Credit card companies
have the right to raise your rate if you don’t
behave the way they want you to. If you
make a late payment, exceed the credit 
limit, don’t pay the minimum amount, or get
caught serving red wine with fish, they might
increase the rate of your finance charge.
 Your credit report comes into play: Credit
card companies can periodically check
your credit report to see how well you do
with other forms of credit. Events that can
lower your overall credit score, such as
liens and garnishments, bankruptcy, excess
or unpaid debt, can also trigger an increase
in your credit card finance charge rate.
 Bad check: Sending a bad check in pay-
ment for your credit card bill can result in a
higher interest rate for you.
 Acquiring a new credit card or loan: That’s
right — the simple act of acquiring a new
credit card or a mortgage or car loan can
give your existing credit card company
enough of a reason to raise your finance
charge rate. Indeed, even inquiring about
new debt can have a ripple effect and raise
your finance charges on your existing credit
cards.
 Annual fees: Don’t forget the annual fee.
Some credit cards charge you a fee just for
the right to carry their card.
But wait! Don’t let any of this keep you from
determining that the correct finance charge
has been assessed. You have the right to con-
tact the credit card company and ask for the
details of how the charge is assessed. 

Quicken Can Help You Put a Leash on Your Spending
288
Enter the new credit limit in the Credit Limit field. While you’re here, you
can enter your card’s interest rate too (assuming you can figure out the
rate — see the “Credit cards and finance charges” sidebar earlier in this
chapter for an introduction into the dark world of computing finance
charges).
3. Click OK to close the window and return to the account list.
Quicken Can Help You Put a Leash on Your Spending
OK, so the credit card company has generously upped your credit limit to
$20,000. Does that mean you have to run up charges of $20,000? Of course
not! You can keep track of your spending yourself, or you can get some assis-
tance from Quicken.
First, you can simply enter a lower credit limit in Quicken instead of entering
the full $20,000. This is done by editing the account and is described earlier
in this chapter under “Changing your credit limit.” Quicken sends you a mes-
sage when you exceed your credit limit.
But why lie to Quicken? Go ahead and enter your real credit limit, but get
Quicken to remind you when you reach your self-imposed limit. Ask for a
credit card alert by following these steps:
1. Open the Alerts Center by choosing Set Up Alerts from the Tools
menu.
2. Click on the plus sign next to Cash Flow to expand the Cash Flow
menu.

3. Click on Credit card limits.
4. Enter your own limit for your credit cards.
For each card you own, you see the name of the card, the card’s credit
limit, and an option to enter another amount in the column called Remind
Me At (see Figure 2-7). Enter your own limit in the Remind Me At column.
5. Choose how you want to be notified.
Your choices are to see an urgent alert box pop up on your screen, or to
have an alert appear in your alert list.
6. Indicate how long you want the alert to be in effect.
Pick from various time limit options up to one year. After a year, you
need to set the alert again.
7. Save your alert information by clicking OK.
Setting a spending alert doesn’t prevent you from spending — you can
still say “Thanks, but no thanks” to the alert (by clicking OK and closing
the window shown in Figure 2-8) and go about your business of charging
amounts on your credit card. The alert is just there as a reminder, so at
least you’re aware of the fact that you’re getting in deep.

Quicken’s Debt Reduction Planner

You can also monitor your spending by using budget alerts. Chapter 5 in this
book shows you how to create and use a budget in Quicken and also how to
set up budget-based alerts.
Quicken’s Debt Reduction Planner
One of the most valuable tools in your Quicken program is the Debt
Reduction Planner (DRP). The DRP can help you get control of and actually
retire your debt, and at the same time, make sure you pay the least amount
of interest. Use the DRP to design a plan that improves your debt situation
by evaluating your debts and organizing them in such a way as to maximize
the use of the money you have available for retiring debt.
Alas, the Debt Reduction Planner is not available in Quicken Basic. You 
must have Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Premier, or Quicken Premier Home 
& Business to take advantage of this feature.
Here’s how the DRP works. Open the planner by choosing Debt Reduction
Planner from the Planning menu. The DRP appears in a separate window.
If you’ve used the DRP before, the window displays a chart and information
from your existing plan. For first-time users, you get to make your way
through a wizard, answering questions and settings up your debt reduction
plan.
When the welcome screen appears (Figure 2-9), follow these steps to create
your own customized debt reduction plan.
1. Oops — no welcome screen appears.
If you’ve been messing around in the DRP already, you might not see the
official welcome screen. That screen is just for new users. Click the New
Plan button to begin a new plan (and get to the welcome screen).

2. Pop some popcorn and watch a movie (optional step).
For a video presentation of how the DRP works, make sure your Quicken
CD is inserted in your CD-ROM drive and click Next on the welcome
screen. If you prefer to bypass the movie, click Next without the CD
inserted in the CD-ROM drive, and you can get right down to business.
P.S.: If you went the movie route, click Next when the movie ends to get
on with the DRP.
3. Review your debts.
Figure 2-10 shows an example of a debts list. The list of your debts
appears under the heading, “How much do I owe?” Make sure all of your
debts are listed, even that hundred bucks you owe your brother. All of
your credit cards and loan amounts should appear here. If you’ve left off
any debts, click the Add button to bring the list up-to-date.
Figure 2-10:

all of your
debts.

4. Add a debt.
When you click the Add button, the Edit Debt Reduction window
appears (see Figure 2-11). Enter all the pertinent information about your
loan, including the amount of the loan, the amount of your payments,
and the interest rate. Click OK when you are finished.
Quicken requires that you enter amounts in every monetary field. You
can’t leave the payment and minimum payment fields empty, even if this
is a casual loan with no specific minimum payment terms. Enter some-
thing, just to make Quicken happy, or you’ll never get to close the
window.
When you add a loan in the DRP, Quicken gives you an opportunity to
set up the loan in the main Quicken program as well. Following the loan
setup steps creates a Quicken loan without disrupting your progress in
the DRP.
5. Verify and revise your debts.
Make sure the correct amounts you owe appear on the debt list, along
with their correct interest rates. If any changes are necessary, click
on the debt to be revised, and then click the Edit button. The Edit
Debt Reduction window appears (the same window that’s displayed in
Figure 2-11), showing everything Quicken knows about your loan. Enter
Figure 2-11:
Entering
information
about your
new loan.

any necessary corrections in the current payment amount, the annual
interest rate, and make adjustments to payment information including
the name of the payee, the account from which your payments are
made, and how payments are made. For example:
• Payment: You write the check
• Write Check: Quicken writes the check
• Online Payment: Electronic transfer
Also, enter the category to which the payments are charged. Click OK
when all the information is complete.
6. Remove debts from DRP.
There might be old debts listed that you forgot were lurking around in
Quicken, debts that were long ago paid off and not recorded in Quicken.
Or there might be debts you want to exclude from the DRP because you
plan to schedule those payments at your own pace. Click on a debt you
want to remove, and then click the Remove button. The debt disappears
from the DRP list, but never fear! The debt still exists within Quicken.
If you need to remove a debt completely from Quicken, when you’re no
longer in the DRP, open Quicken’s Account List, click on the debt you
want to remove, and click the Delete button.
7. Review your debt status.
Quicken gives you a mini-review of your current debt, your current mini-
mum payments, and the year when your current debt will be liquidated.
Click Next to continue.
8. Adjust payment order.
Click Next in the DRP to get to the Order tab. Your debts are presented
in the order of the most expensive debt first, the least expensive debt
last. Expensive doesn’t refer to the debt with the highest outstanding
balance. Expensive in this case means the debt with the highest interest
rate.
Now you see why it’s important to include the interest rate with each
debt! If you skipped over step 4 earlier, click the Back button to return to
the Debts tab and edit the debts that need an adjustment to the interest
rate. Then click Next to continue.
The order list is designed to expedite the payoff of debt in the order
listed. A logical payoff method is to eliminate the most expensive debt
first. However, this approach might not be appropriate for you. There
might be loans you’re committed to paying off first, or some debt you
want to keep for a long time, even though the interest is higher than the
interest on other debts. Click the Change Payment Order box, and then
click Next if you want to change the order in which the debts are paid off.

Quicken’s Debt Reduction Planner
294
9. Examine optimized payment plan.
Quicken offers a payment plan that allows you to pay off the most
expensive debt first, thus minimizing interest. Then you are to roll the
payment from the debt you retired into the next debt, thus increasing
your minimum payment on the next debt, and so on. In this way, you can
speed up the extinguishment of all of your debt. Click Next after examin-
ing the plan.
10. Apply savings to your debt.
If you have money in savings accounts, Quicken suggests you make a
one-time payment out of savings to lower your debt. The accompanying
video explains that saving money at a lower interest rate while paying
debt at a higher rate isn’t the most advantageous use of your money. If
you choose to direct a one-time payment from savings toward your debt
reduction, enter the amount in the field provided (see Figure 2-12).
11. Consider trimming your budget.
Some of your budgeted expenses are displayed, with the encouragement
to cut back and apply some of the money from those expenses toward
your debt. We talk more about budgeting in Chapter 5 of this book. You
can make some budget adjustments now if you want. You can also return
to your DRP later and fine-tune the plan, making budget adjustments or
increasing your minimum payments if you want to increase the amount
you target for your debt.
Any changes you make should automatically adjust your debt scenario
at the bottom of the DRP window, but in case no change appears, you
can click the Recalculate button to update your debt plan.
12. Review the final plan.

Quicken presents you with the final debt reduction plan, and you can
print the plan by clicking the Print button right in the DRP window. This
plan details how your money will be used for extinguishing various
debts, how much the plan is projected to save you, the schedule of
extinguishment, the use of a one-time payment from savings, and adjust-
ments to your other spending. Print the plan, refer to it often, and moni-
tor your progress.
If you add additional debt, or find yourself with a cash windfall that can
be applied to your debt, go back to the plan and make changes.
13. Automate your plan.
When you click Next after reviewing your plan, the DRP gives you
options to receive alerts if you fall behind on your plan, and also options
to produce a complete payment schedule to accompany your plan.
Choose either or both of these options if you like, by checking the
appropriate boxes and then clicking Next. If you choose to be alerted if
you fall behind in your plan, Quicken sends you an alert whenever you
miss a plan-related payment. If you choose the schedule, you see a
detailed schedule of all payments due from now until the plan ends. You
have the option to print this schedule.
14. Update your plan.
After you’ve created a plan, returning to the DRP window produces a
graph. Change existing debt information by clicking the Update Debt
Balances option at the top of the graph. Each of your debts appears in
an update window (Figure 2-13) where you can make changes to balance
and payment information, or you can click on a debt and click the Edit
button to make more detailed changes to the loan (such as a change in
interest rate on your credit card). Click Done to close the update window.
Choosing the New Plan option that appears at the top of the DRP graph
results in replacing your current plan with a new plan.

or many people, the home is the most valuable asset they own. So it
only makes sense that you should want to have a record of the cost of the
home as well as the improvements you added to it. In addition to your home,
you probably own other items that have value to you, such as your vintage
Barbie dolls, a coin collection (not just the jar of loose change from your
pocket, but serious collector coins like Indian head pennies, Mercury dimes,
and gold double eagles), musical instruments, silver serving dishes, and so
on. There are insurance reasons, tax reasons, and personal reasons for keep-
ing track of information on these items. This is a job for Quicken!

Mortgage Basics

Mortgage Basics
A mortgage is a loan secured by a personal residence, like a house, a condo-
minium, a trailer, or a houseboat. The residence is used as collateral against
the loan, meaning that if the loan doesn’t get paid, the lender gets the
residence.
The amount you borrow is called the principal; the payment you make is
increased by interest, and sometimes an extra amount, which goes into
an escrow account, to cover expenses that the lender pays on your behalf,
including property taxes, fire and hazard insurance, and mortgage insurance.
Types of mortgage loans
The most common mortgage is a 30-year fixed-
rate mortgage. But you might be surprised to
learn that there are lots of different types of mort-
gages available. Just look at some of the options:
 Fixed rate mortgages: A fixed rate mort-
gage is a mortgage with a set interest rate
that doesn’t change over the term of the
loan. Fixed rate mortgages can be arranged
for 15 years, 20 years, 30 years, or another
term agreed upon with the lender. Some-
times a lender offers a lower interest rate
with a shorter-term loan.
 Adjustable rate mortgage: The interest rate
on this type of loan is determined by using
the rate on one-year U.S. Treasury bills,
bank certificates of deposit, or the Federal
Reserve interest rate. The rate is typically
recalculated once a year, meaning the
amount of your mortgage payment varies
from one year to the next. There is risk
involved with this type of loan because no
one can really predict what the interest
rate will be from year to year.
 Balloon mortgage: A low interest rate tied
to a short-term loan (typically five to seven
years) with a large payment at the end
describes this type of mortgage. This loan
is ideal for people who either expect to
have a lot of cash available to pay off the
loan at the end of the term, who plan on
refinancing the loan within five to seven
years, or who expect to sell the house
before the balloon payment is due.
 Interest-only mortgage: With this type of
loan, the borrower’s payment only covers
the interest on the loan, not the principal.
The borrower accumulates no equity in the
home, but the trade-off is lower monthly
payments. This type of mortgage is designed
for people who own homes that are
expected to increase in value, or who don’t
plan to be in a home long enough to build
equity.
 Reverse mortgage: Designed for senior cit-
izens with little or no balance remaining on
their existing mortgage, this type of mort-
gage results in the homeowner receiving
money from the lender who holds a lien on
the home. This is a way for older people 
to increase their monthly income without
having to sell their home.

Mortgage Basics
300
Mortgage loans are typically written as 15-year or 30-year loans, although it’s
possible to arrange for a loan over a different length of time.

For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown (Wiley Publishing).
Recording a mortgage
When you’re ready to set up your mortgage in Quicken, it’s helpful to have
all the facts and figures ready and waiting. Here’s a checklist of the informa-
tion you need to have on hand before you begin the setup process:
✦The original principal of your mortgage
✦The rate of interest you’re paying
✦The total principal and interest included in each monthly payment
✦The amount you’re paying into escrow each month
✦The cost of the home
✦The date you purchased the home
✦The amount of principal you owe on the home today
When you’ve gathered all of the above information, you’re ready to begin the
setup. Follow these steps to enter your home and your mortgage in Quicken:
1. Open the Loan Setup window, and then click Next.
There are a couple of methods for getting to the Loan Setup window. For
example, you can open the View Loans window by pressing Ctrl+H and
then click the New option. Or you can click on the Property & Debt
center over on your Account Bar, and then click the Add Loan button.
2. Choose the Borrow Money option, and then click Next.
3. Enter a name for the account, such as Mortgage, and then click Next.
4. Indicate if you have previously made payments on this loan. For this
example, I’ve chosen Yes (Figure 3-2).
5. Enter the original date of your loan, and the original principal
amount, as shown in Figure 3-3.
6. Answer the balloon payment question, Yes or No.
If you answer Yes, a question appears in a couple of screens asking you
for the amortized length of the loan. In other words, you need to enter the
number of years you expect to make payments on the loan. The balloon

Book IV
Chapter 3

Mortgage Basics
301
payment is due at the end of this amortized length. For this example, I’m
entering No as the answer to the balloon payment question, so that issue
of the amortized length of the loan won’t even come up.
A balloon payment doesn’t mean you get clowns and surprises and
helium-filled balloons delivered to your door when you make a payment,
although it’s nice to think that perhaps the first person who made a bal-
loon payment, back when someone came up with the name, received
just such a celebration. Instead, the balloon payment is a monumental
event of a financial nature — a large payment made at the end of the
loan term, paying off the entire balance.
7. Enter the length, or term of the loan.
The term is the number of years this loan is scheduled to be in exis-
tence. I’ve entered 30 years in this example, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-3:
Refer to
your
checklist
items, and
enter the
date and
amount of
the loan.
Figure 3-2:
Yep, we’ve
already
made some
payments.

Mortgage Basics
302
8. Next, you are asked to enter the payment period.
Generally, mortgage loans are set up with monthly payments, so that is
what I’ve entered in Figure 3-5. However, Quicken is equipped to deal
with payments of all types, from weekly to annually and everything in
between. Pick the payment term you plan to use, even if that differs from
the term on your mortgage loan document. Why, you ask, would you
enter a term different from that which appears on the loan document?
See the sidebar entitled, “Paying your mortgage early,” for an interesting
insight into the joys of making more frequent mortgage payments.
9. Enter the compounding period.
“Hey, what’s this compounding period?” you might ask. Good question.
The compounding period refers to the frequency with which your inter-
est is calculated. Most mortgages come with a daily compounding
period. Quicken gives you choices of daily, monthly, or semi-annually.
Figure 3-5:

frequency 
of your

Book IV
Chapter 3
Your Home
Mortgage Basics
303
Here’s an example that might shed some light on how the interest is
compounded. Say you have a $100,000 loan at 6 percent interest. If your
interest is compounded annually, you’d multiply the principal $100,000
times the interest rate of 6 percent, and the result would be $6,000 inter-
est for the year. One calculation, one amount. For monthly compound-
ing, the calculation is a bit more complex — 12 times more complex, to
be exact. The first month is easy. You multiply the $100,000 by 6 percent,
get $6,000, and divide that by 12 (representing 1 month), for a total of
$500 interest for the month. In month two, you reduce the principal
by the amount of principal you paid last month (I’ll use $100, which
leaves $99,900 in principal), multiply the remaining principal by 6 percent
($5,994), and divide by 12 to get $499.50. And so on. Each month, you
reduce your loan balance by the amount you’ve paid against that balance,
and then calculate the interest on the remaining loan balance. Daily com-
pounding results in a new computation each day instead of once a month.
Daily compounding also results in a slightly higher amount of interest paid
than monthly.
10. Enter the current loan balance. Or not.
If you know the amount you owe on your mortgage as of your last mort-
gage payment, go ahead and answer the question Yes on Figure 3-6 and,
on the next window, you get to enter the balance. If you’re not sure of
the balance, enter No and Quicken computes the loan balance for you.
11. Enter the date and amount of the loan.
If you told Quicken you know the amount of your loan balance, here’s
your chance to enter that information. Enter the most recent date for
which you know the loan balance (this might be the date of your last
mortgage payment), and the balance on that date. Otherwise, go on to
the next step.
Figure 3-6:
Do you
know how
much your
current
mortgage
balance is?

Mortgage Basics
304
12. Enter the date of your next payment.
This one’s easy. Enter the due date for your next mortgage payment.
13. Enter the amount of your next payment.
Ha! You probably think you know the amount that you owe on your next
mortgage payment, but don’t be so quick to answer. See the warning
below. You can let Quicken calculate the amount if you’re not sure.
When Quicken asks for the mortgage payment amount, this is a trick
question. Be sure to enter just the loan principal and interest. Many
people have additional payments included in their mortgage, like taxes
and insurance. The question in step 13 and shown in Figure 3-7 is refer-
ring only to principal and interest. The information about your supple-
mental payments gets entered later.
14. Enter the interest rate for the loan.
15. Review summary screens.
As you click Next, Quicken displays some summary screens showing
you the detail of the information you entered. Review these screens and
make sure everything agrees with your loan documents.
16. Done — but not quite.
When you click Done to exit out of the Loan Setup wizard, the Set Up
Loan Payment window appears, giving you an opportunity to automate
your loan payment in Quicken. And why not? Your loan payment is the
same each month, so it makes sense to set up the payment so that it
appears or is paid automatically.

When the Set Up Loan Payment window appears, you can refer back to
Chapter 1 of Book IV for information on how to fill out this section.
When entering information in the Set Up Loan Payment window, you can
click the Edit button that appears in this window to enter information about
miscellaneous payments that are included with your loan, including real
estate tax and homeowner’s insurance.
Associating your home asset with your mortgage
As soon as you finish with the instructions for setting up your loan payment,
you are asked if you want to associate an asset with this loan (see Figure 3-8).
Click Yes because you do want to set up your home in Quicken and have the
home associated with the loan. That way, you can produce a report showing
the true value of the home, offset by the loan. You can follow these instruc-
tions to set up your home in your Quicken file.
Paying your mortgage early
One of the topics you should discuss with your
mortgage lender is the treatment of early pay-
ments of principal. Some lenders include a
penalty clause in the mortgage if you make extra
principal payments. In particular, if your credit
isn’t the best and as a result you have a mort-
gage loan with a higher-than-average interest
rate, you may be penalized if you try to make
extra or early principal payments on the loan.
If your lender allows you make extra payments,
take a look at the amazing amount of money
you can save by simply making one extra pay-
ment a year, or by altering the pace at which
you make your payments.
For example, a 30-year mortgage for $80,000 at
8 percent interest results in 360 payments of
$479.64 over the 30-year period, or $172,670.40,
representing $80,000 in principal and $92,670.40
in interest. Make 13 payments per year instead
of the standard 12 payments, and the 30-year
loan becomes a 24.75-year loan, with 297 total
payments equaling approximately $153,758.
You’ve managed to knock nearly $19,000 off in
interest. Just think what you could do with an
extra $19,000! And the amount of time and
money you can save increases if your loan
amount or your interest rate is higher.
One of the easiest ways to squeeze in an extra
payment during the year is to make your mort-
gage payment every two weeks instead of once
a month. This works especially well if you get
paid weekly or bi-weekly. You can arrange for
automatic payments to coincide with the
receipt of your paycheck. Instead of squeezing
out a 13th payment at the end of the year, the
extra payment just becomes part of your regu-
lar monthly cycle.

Mortgage Basics
306
1. After answering Yes to the question about setting up the asset, it’s
time to give the asset a name.
You can use “House,” or “Home,” or the street address of the home, or a
nickname that you use for your home. You are limited to 40 characters,
including spaces, for the name.
2. Enter a date and value for the home, as shown in Figure 3-9. This is
where the asset setup gets a bit tricky.
If you need to track the cost of your home for tax purposes, you should
enter the purchase date of the home and the original cost. Alternatively,
if you simply want to keep track of the home at its current value, you
can enter today’s date, or the date of your last appraisal, and the
market value of the home. See the information in the “Tax rules for
home sales” sidebar to help determine if you should track the cost of
your home.

3. You can skip the Tax button in the Account Setup window.
This button is for accounts where cash is transferred in or out, so that
won’t apply to your home.
4. Click Done to save the information about your home.
If you choose to enter the cost of your home and its related improve-
ments (see the section titled “Home Improvements,” later in this chap-
ter), be sure to include the miscellaneous settlement fees you paid when
you purchased the home. These get added to the cost of the home and
become part of the home’s basis.
If you set up your home separately in Quicken, before you set up your mort-
gage, you can easily associate an existing home with a new mortgage. First
set up the mortgage, and then, in the Property & Debt Center, click on the
home account, click on the Overview tab, and then click the Edit Account
Details button. In the Mortgage Account field, select the mortgage that
relates to this home. Then click OK to save the information.
Tax rules for home sales
Until ten years ago, if you purchased a home,
you were required to keep track of the original
cost and the cost of improvements to the home
for tax purposes. Then, when you sold the
home, if you made a profit on the sale (which
most people do), you had to either pay tax on
the profit, or roll the profit forward into your
next home, and next home, and next home, until
someday, when you stopped buying homes, 
you might have to pay tax on the accumulated
profits on all your homes. Unless of course you
were over age 55 when you sold the final home,
in which case you were exonerated from at
least some of the tax bite.
But times change, and so do tax laws. Keep in
mind that, as with any tax law, there are excep-
tions to the rules and special rules for special
cases, and it always makes sense to speak with
a tax professional before making decisions that
affect your tax return. That said, here are the
basic rules you need to know when buying and
selling your personal residence:
 If you own the home for at least five years
and live in the home as your primary resi-
dence for at least two of those five years,
and sell the home for a profit of not more
than $250,000 (or $500,000 if you are married
and filing a joint tax return), you don’t have
to pay tax on the profit, nor do you have to
report the sale of the home on your income
tax return.
 If you don’t meet the above requirements,
you might have to pay tax on the profit from
your house.
 If you use part of the home for business
purposes, you do need to keep track of all
of the costs associated with your home, so
that you can take a tax deduction for the
business portion of your home.

Home Improvements
308
Home Improvements
Sooner or later, your home is going to need some work. You might need to
make some repairs, or you might have to replace windows. Hail might have
damaged the roof. And improvements do not always mean bad news. Maybe
you want to upgrade your kitchen to include fancy cabinets and state-of-the-
art appliances. Or maybe you decide to build a deck out back, redo the
shelving in your closets, or cover a wall with built-in bookcases.
If the changes you make improve or add to the value of the home, prolong
the life of the home, or adapt the home to a new use, they are considered
improvements. If they simply maintain the status quo (like painting the walls
that are covered with fingerprints, or replacing a malfunctioning hot water
heater), they are considered repairs.
Because improvements add to the value of the home, you should keep track
of the cost of improvements, just as you keep track of the cost of your home.
Not only is there the possibility that you might have to report a future sale of
the home on your tax return (see the “Tax rules for home sales” sidebar), in
which case the cost of the improvements you made is a crucial part of calcu-
lating the profit on the home, but there are other reasons why you might
want to keep track of your improvements. Just look:
✦Insurance: Your homeowner’s insurance covers the value of your home,
right? So it stands to reason that if you make changes that increase the
value of your home, your insurance agent needs to hear about those
changes and what they cost. Keep a detailed list (oh wait! Quicken can
do that for you!) and provide a copy of that list to your insurance agent.
✦New owner: If you plan on selling the home, even if there are no tax 
ramifications applicable to the sale, the new owner might want to 
know about all of the changes and improvements you’ve made. Your 
real estate agent probably wants to know too.
✦Taxable sale: I can’t emphasize enough the possibility that the sale
might be taxable. You can add a new wing this year and maybe five years
from now you decide to make that wing into a home office. Suddenly all
of the costs of the new wing become part of your tax return, and the IRS
doesn’t like it when you don’t have records and receipts.
The best advice is to keep track of your home improvements, the cost and the
date acquired, and save the receipts too. Stash all the information in a file, just
in case you need it.

What qualifies as home improvement
The IRS sets out examples of what types of expenditures qualify as home
improvements for purposes of adding to the basis of your home. Here are
some samples of what can be considered home improvements:
✦Upgrading windows with storms, triple-tracks, thermal glass, or other
options better than what you had previously
✦Upgrading or adding heating, cooling, and ventilation systems and
insulation
✦Outdoor improvements, including adding a garage or carport; paving
a previously unpaved driveway; adding a tennis court, in-ground pool,
deck, porch, patio, permanent landscaping (including trees, shrubs, and
perennials), walkways, ponds, and so on
✦Remodeling a kitchen or bathroom or other room, improving the room
or its use over what it was before the remodeling
✦Improving plumbing or wiring
✦Adding built-in appliances or storage units
✦Erecting a fence or retaining wall
✦Installing a satellite dish
✦Installing a central vacuum system
✦Finishing an unfinished basement, attic, or crawlspace
✦Putting on a new roof
✦Installing an underground sprinkler system
✦Replacing a septic system or water well
✦Installing new flooring or wall-to-wall carpets
✦Adding a security system
Be sure to keep track of the original cost, including delivery and installation
charges, of any of the improvements you make on your home.

2. Go to the asset account for your home.
In the Property section of the Property & Debt Center, click on the hyper-
link that is the name you gave your home. The asset detail appears.
3. Go to the Overview tab.
If the asset register appeared when you clicked on the asset hyperlink,
click now on the Overview tab that appears at the top of the register
(see Figure 3-10).
4. Click the number that represents the Current Balance — this number
is hyperlinked — to open the Update Account Balance dialog box (see
Figure 3-11).
The hyperlinked amount for this asset’s Current Balance appears under
the Account Status heading.
5. Update the home’s balance.
Click in the Update Balance To field, and then enter the new value of the
home. This new value is the value you clicked on in the asset screen
plus the cost of the improvements you’ve added.

6. Verify or change the date.
Quicken has selected today’s date as the date on which you made the
improvement. You should change this date to coincide with the date
on which the improvement was purchased or the work was completed,
whichever is later.
7. Choose a category.
You might have already established a category where this improvement
should be tracked. That would have happened when you entered the
expense for the improvement. Choose that category now, or, if you haven’t
yet set up your improvements category, do so now by entering a new cate-
gory name in the field, and then setting up the category on-the-fly. Click
OK to save your adjustment to the home’s basis.
You can read about setting up categories on-the-fly in Book II, Chapter 1.
Working with the Quicken Home Inventory
Quicken’s Home Inventory feature is a nifty little tool that works in conjunc-
tion with your Quicken program, sharing information with your Quicken
accounts, and at the same time, providing a little service that is different
from the mainstream Quicken features. The Home Inventory is a program
that insurance agents love — it’s a method for listing and valuing basically
everything you own, or at least everything you own that you want to have
a record of.
With the Home Inventory program, you can keep track of your furnishings,
your books, your home accessories such as antiques and appliances, cloth-
ing, toys, tools, you name it. The inventory program is also nice for keeping
track of collectible items, not just for insurance purposes, but also for tax
and inheritance purposes.
You can go nuts with this program, entering every little item you own, down
to the latest issue of TV Guide and the new alligator-shaped corn-on-the-cob
holders (corn-igators!) you bought last week. Or you can be a bit more
reserved with the program, and use it as a listing both for homeowner’s
or renter’s insurance purposes as well as a useful and interesting listing of
your possessions.
When you open the Home Inventory program, a separate screen appears.
You work in the inventory program, entering and updating information
about your personal possessions, and then you update the information in

your main Quicken program. After that update is accomplished, you can
close the inventory program. Your home inventory assets are now added to
the total assets reported in your Quicken program and are a part of your net
worth calculations.
Follow these steps to record home inventory items and update Quicken:
1. Open the Home Inventory program.
Choose Quicken Home Inventory from the Property & Debt menu. The
Home Inventory program opens in a separate window.
2. Familiarize yourself with the Home Inventory program.
Click around a bit — you won’t hurt anything. Here’s a sample of what
you see:
• At the top of the inventory list there is a View By Location field, as
you can see in Figure 3-12. Clicking the drop-down arrow displays all
of the possible rooms Quicken can think of that might be in your
home. There’s even an option for your Safe Deposit Box, and another
for Unassigned, in case the location where some assets are stored
isn’t on the list. For example, you might own some items that a friend
is borrowing, or maybe you own some items that you are trying to
sell and they are on consignment at a store.
• At the right is a list of suggested items that you might own. These are
just suggestions, but the list can give you ideas of items you might
have forgotten. Also this list can serve as a timesaver — if you select
an item from the list, Quicken adds the item to the room or other
location that is currently active, and assigns a suggested replace-
ment and resale value for the item.

• No matter which room or location you choose, at the top of the item
list, the item category column displays the category of Furnishings.
Click the down-arrow next to Furnishings, and you see other options,
including clothing, electronics, jewelry and valuables, and so on.
Clicking on one of these categories changes the detail of the sug-
gested items list on the right.

Working with the Quicken Home Inventory
314
• The Policies button gives you a window with a place for listing each
of your insurance policies, and how much the actual coverage is.
Quicken calculates the replacement cost of all covered items, and
then informs you of the difference between the two amounts.
• The Claims button gives you a place to list insurance claims and
related proceeds. This is important information to save should you
sell any of the insured items. If you receive insurance proceeds for a
damaged item, the amount of insurance you receive affects your
basis for the item.
• I love the Find button! This button enables you to perform a search
throughout the home inventory archives. Those of us who are start-
ing to get forgetful can really take advantage of this tool. Seriously,
spend a day or two and list everything you own in the inventory, in
the room where it belongs. Then when you lose something (where
did I put that crystal vase I got last year for Christmas?), you can run
a search, and voilà! The vase is found!
• The Move Item feature works well in conjunction with the Find fea-
ture. Say you decide to move that crystal vase from the living room
to the den. Don’t just move the vase. Move it in the Home Inventory
program too! Click the Move Item button, and then, in the window
that appears (Figure 3-15), move the item to another room. Here’s an
example: I’m going to relocate my violin from the bedroom to its new
home in the study. I click the Move Item button, choose Bedroom for
the Current Location, and the program displays a list of the items 
I’ve entered for the bedroom. Then I click on the violin, click on the
Office/Study as the new location, and then click the Move button.

• Update Quicken with your additions to the Home Inventory by click-
ing the Update button. In the little window that appears (Figure 3-16),
click Yes to send the updated information to your main Quicken pro-
gram. The next time you’re in Quicken, click on the Property & Debt
center. Under Property (Assets), you see an entry for Home
Inventory with the total that you entered as resale value for all of
your Home Inventory assets.
• If you want to go back to Quicken and leave the Home Inventory pro-
gram open, click the Goto Qkn button. Alternatively, if you’re ready
to close the Home Inventory program, just close the program by
clicking the little X in the upper-right corner.
Valuing Collectibles
You can use the Home Inventory feature to record your collections. You
probably won’t want to list all of the individual stamps or coins you own, but
you can list the entire collection, with one value, and then make changes in
the value as the need arises. If you have a collection of a manageable size,
you can enter each item in the collection in the Home Inventory program.
Notice that when you enter an item with a replacement cost, Quicken imme-
diately assumes the resale cost (the cost at which you could actually sell the
item) is one-half of the replacement cost. This is an automatic entry and
probably has little to do with the actual resale cost.
Be sure you check the resale values carefully — you know better than Quicken
how much your possessions are really worth. And, because it’s the resale
value that Quicken uses when valuing your possessions in your Quicken
reports, you should take care to make sure the amount that appears as
resale value is as close as possible to the actual resale value and not just 
an arbitrary estimate.
Figure 3-16:
Update your
assets in
Quicken.

Valuing Collectibles
316
There are several reasons why you might want to record the value of your
collectible items. Here are some of them:
✦Taxes: Ah, the ubiquitous tax issue. Should you sell a collectible item,
the IRS certainly wants to hear about the sale. You need to record your
original cost and any additional costs you’ve incurred for that item, as
well as the sales price of the item. Unfortunately, the Quicken Home
Inventory program doesn’t give you an opportunity to enter acquisition
dates — you have to keep that information stored somewhere else, or
enter the items as separate assets within the main Quicken program.
✦Gifts: We’ve heard that it’s bad form to ask someone how much a gift
costs. But sometimes the recipient of the gift needs that information.
The person who receives the gift might need to know the original cost
information in order to calculate taxable gain should that person ulti-
mately sell the gifted item.
✦Insurance: We’re back to insurance again. Collectible items might need
to be listed separately on your insurance policy. Check with your insur-
ance agent to find out how much of your personal possessions is cov-
ered by your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance. For items that need to
be insured separately, you need to decide first if you’re going to insure
the replacement value or the resale value. Then, in either case, you need
to give that information to the insurance agent.

and Bill Pay
In This Chapter
 Enrolling and paying for the service
 Setting up payees
 Paying bills
 Scheduling payments
 Stopping online payments
I
’ve taught Quicken classes for several years, and for the longest time,
when the topic of online bill payment would come up in the classroom,
I’d have to explain how the service was supposed to work, without first-
hand experience. Fortunately, somebody in my class would have actually
used an online bill payment service, and in addition to sharing firsthand
insights, this person would invariably say, “Once you try online bill-paying,
you’ll never go back to writing checks by hand.” I finally got around to sign-
ing up for online bill-paying service a few years ago, and you know what?
Those students of mine were right.
What’s the Difference? Billminder versus Bill Pay
Billminder is an old standby feature of Quicken that has been around almost
ever since I can remember. This little program operates independently of
your Quicken program in that it pops up each time you start your computer
and reminds you of scheduled transactions that are due, even while Quicken
isn’t running. The Billminder program is completely optional, so if you don’t
want to use it, you don’t have to. There is no fee for the use of Billminder
(as opposed to Bill Pay).
Bill Pay is a fee-based service offered by Intuit. For $9.95 per month (as of
this writing), you can pay bills online, schedule payments up to a year in
advance (for people who really like to be organized about paying their bills),
receive notification when bills arrive, set up repeat payments, transfer money
among accounts (my personal favorite feature), and automatically transfer
all the bill-paying activity into your Quicken register.

What’s the Difference? Billminder versus Bill Pay
318
When you sign up for Bill Pay, Intuit gives you the first month for free. So, you
can fool around with the program for 30 days and decide if you like it without
having to purchase the service. After you sign on, you can cancel at anytime.
How do these services work?
Billminder is a reminder program that works when you enable the program
(as described in “Getting Friendly with Billminder,” later in this chapter).
Billminder tells you that you need to pay a bill, print some checks, buy your
best friend a birthday present, clip your toenails, or whatever else you want
it to tell you. The important thing to remember is that Billminder doesn’t
have a mind of its own. The alerts that you receive from Billminder are the
alerts that you set up in your Quicken program. If you forgot to mention to
Quicken that your mortgage is due on the 5th of every month, Billminder
isn’t going to know about that payment either.
Bill Pay, on the other hand, is a completely different breed of software. Bill
Pay is the 4-H Grand Champion of interactive bill paying programs (forgive
me — it’s State Fair time in my home state and I’ve got giant zucchinis and
blue ribbon Holsteins on my mind). Bill Pay doesn’t come as a part of your
Quicken program; instead, you have to go to the Quicken Web site and sign
up for the service. Then it is your choice to use Bill Pay, or not, whenever
you want.
So, do I really need all this bill-related stuff?
The bill features are extras, and you can get by just fine without these serv-
ices. The Billminder is just a little alerts program that hovers around on your
computer screen, happy to remind you of impending payment deadlines and
other events, and just as happy if you choose ignore the reminders. The Bill
Pay program is 21st century–style automation. If you’re happy writing checks
by hand and then entering those checks in Quicken, don’t feel any pressure
to use the Bill Pay service that Quicken provides. In fact, you might already
have an online bill paying relationship with your bank and in many ways the
Quicken program would be redundant. You might not need two online bill-
payment services.
The Bill Pay service offers extra advantages, however, that your bank might
not be able to provide. For example, Bill Pay interacts completely with
Quicken so you don’t have to enter your bills in your Quicken register after
you’ve paid them. You can also set up ongoing scheduled payments in Bill
Pay so you don’t have to return each month or each quarter to make sure
the payment is sent. And, you can use Bill Pay to transfer money easily from
one account another, even if the accounts are not at the same bank. See a
complete list of Bill Pay features later in this chapter in the sidebar titled,
“What’s so cool about Quicken Bill Pay?”

Getting Friendly with Billminder
Because Billminder works outside of Quicken, you don’t need to be working
in Quicken to turn on the Billminder program. In fact, you actually have to
close your Quicken program before you can open the Billminder program.
You’d think these two would be friendlier than that with each other . . .
Explore how the Billminder program works by opening the Billminder pro-
gram and checking out the options. Follow these steps and you’ll be there:
1. From your taskbar, click Start➪All Programs➪Quicken➪Billminder
(see Figure 4-1).
I put Billminder on my desktop by right-clicking on the Billminder option
that appears on the Start/All Programs menu, and then choosing Send To,
and then Desktop (Create Shortcut). Now I can see my Quicken alerts
anytime I want by just clicking the Billminder icon.
2. When the Billminder window appears (see Figure 4-2), catch up on
what you’ve been ignoring in Quicken.
For example, see the scheduled transactions that are ready to occur
(or that you’ve missed), and get a quick glimpse of account balances
that have exceeded the ceiling you designated or spending limits you’ve
gone over. (Tsk. Tsk.)
Figure 4-1:
Finding
Billminder.

Getting Friendly with Billminder
320
3. By default, Billminder is not turned on when you install Quicken, so
click the Options menu choice in Billminder.
The Billminder Options window appears (Figure 4-3).
4. Turn on Billminder by checking the box to Enable Billminder on
Windows Startup.
The list of alert options that was previously dim comes alive!
5. Next, decide if you want to have Billminder popping up all the time,
like a feisty little puppy (leave the first indented box unchecked), or 
if you only want to see Billminder when Billminder has something
worthwhile to say to you (check the first indented box).
6. Now, choose which types of alerts you want to be pestered with. Here
are your options:
• Scheduled transactions: This refers to transactions that you’ve
already scheduled in Quicken. You can schedule transactions for 
any date or frequency — Billminder gives you advance notice when
it’s time for the transactions to occur.
• Checks to print: You’ve scheduled some checks to be printed in
Quicken but the checks don’t get printed by themselves. Checks
waiting in the print queue trigger a message in Billminder. Billminder
gives you advance notice of checks that are due to be printed in the
future, and also reminds you of checks that you were supposed to
print but did not.
Figure 4-2:
Billminder is
ready and
waiting.

Chapter 4

321
• Online payments: You’ve arranged for some online payments, but
the payments have yet to be dispatched. Billminder lets you know
that you’ve got online business to take care of.
• Investment reminders: Any reminders you set for yourself in the
investment transactions window flow through to Billminder.
• Calendar notes: Remember the financial calendar? We discussed this in
Book II, Chapter 3. You can create a reminder entry on the calendar for
anything you want, including both financial and non-financial matters.
Your financial calendar reminders flow through to the Billminder 
so you won’t forget that money you promised to send your brother,
your best friend’s birthday gift, lunch with the boss, or the school 
PTA meeting.
OK, I’ve got an alert that needs action: Now what?
Billminder has done its job, appearing onscreen and telling you to get busy
and finalize your Quicken transactions. Now it’s time to actually get things
done in Quicken: Click the Run Quicken button at the bottom of the Billminder
window. Poof! As quickly as you can say, “Hey! What was that alert about the
tax payment I was supposed to make?” Billminder has closed, taking its alerts
out of sight and opening Quicken in its place.
Not interested in running Quicken at this time? Just click the Exit button in
Billminder, and the program leaves you alone until the next time you start
your computer.
Don’t forget that you can see all of your alerts in Quicken too, so you can get
back to reading about that tax payment and other alerts as well. Depending
on how your Quicken program opens, you might see your alerts right at the
top of the screen from the get-go.
If Quicken opens with the Home page displayed, alerts appear at the top.
Any of the other centers (Cash Flow, Investing, and so on) also start with
an alerts section at the top of the window. You can always click the Show All
Alerts button beneath the alerts list to see alerts in all categories.

Don’t let your Quicken program push you around: You get to control how
Quicken appears when the program opens. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Quicken Program to open the Quicken Preferences window. Click on Startup,
and then choose from all the options in the drop-down list to decide what
screen you want to see each time you open Quicken.
If you open a window that doesn’t show any alerts, you can pull up your
alerts list quickly by going to the Tools menu and picking Show All Alerts.
An Alerts Center opens in a separate window that you can close by clicking
on the X in the upper-right corner.
For faster service, or at least a different way to get back to Quicken from
Billminder, you can double-click on one of the scheduled transactions
listed in Billminder. You get the same routine as if you clicked on the
Run Quicken button: Billminder closes, Quicken opens, and all’s well
with the world.
Bye-bye, Billminder
Each time you boot up, Billminder kicks in and lets you know what’s pending.
If you’re sick of seeing Billminder, click the Options button again and uncheck
the Enable Billminder box. Billminder slinks away, playing solitaire and keep-
ing itself idle until you decide you miss your old friend and want to see the
alerts again.

What’s so cool about Quicken Bill Pay?
You might still be wondering why you should
use Quicken Bill Pay when you already have
the ability to make online payments, and your
bank lets you pay bills from its Web site. If
you’ve explored other bill payment services,
some of Bill Pay’s features probably look famil-
iar, but some are unique to Quicken’s program,
and they are what sets this program aside from
other online services. 
 Pay bills from any computer, anywhere, 24/7.
 All necessary information about your payees
is stored the first time you enter it, so you
never have to enter addresses and account
numbers again.
 Payments can be made to any person or
company anywhere in the United States —
the recipient of your payment does not have
to be able to receive electronic payments.
If an electronic payment cannot be made,
Quicken sends a check to the recipient.
 Schedule payments up to one year in
advance, reducing the chance that you’ll
miss an important payment.
 Set up recurring payments once and forget
about them — Quicken makes sure they
continue to get paid on the schedule you
picked.
 Save money when you use Bill Pay by
doing away with the need for envelopes,
postage stamps, and paper checks.
 Save time with Bill Pay by entering payment
amounts and authorizing payments right on
your computer instead of having to hand-
write checks.
 Your Bill Pay transactions automatically get
entered into Quicken every time you initiate
an online update from within Quicken. That
way, you don’t have to worry about making
an online payment and forgetting to enter it
in your register. As an added bonus, this
ensures that your register balance stays
current and correct.
 Set up your bills so that the companies send
the bill directly to Bill Pay — then all you
have to do is approve the bill for payment.
 Make payments from up to 10 different
accounts.
 Stop worrying about late payments. You
can schedule payments in advance to
make sure the money arrives when it’s due.
 Transfer funds from any of your accounts
to another account. This includes transfers
between bank accounts and investment
accounts as well as bank to bank transfers.
 Payments are guaranteed to be accurate
and received on time or Quicken takes the
heat and pays any late fees you incur.
 You can receive e-mail notification when
bill payments are actually made.
 Bill Pay’s technical support is available 24/7.
 Bill Pay’s service provides safe encryption
of your sensitive financial data.

Reading the fine print
Paying bills online is mega-fun if you enjoy effi-
ciency and time-saving tools. And the process is
easy and completely intuitive. Before you jump
in with both feet, here are the little warnings
that are hidden in the fine print:
 Cost: Don’t forget that this program costs
money to use. The fee is $9.95 per month.
That might be small change to you, or maybe
not. If you only pay two or three bills per
month, it might not be worth it to you to sign
on for this type of service. (Intuit reserves
the right to raise the price at some point in
the future.) On the other hand, if you pay
tons of bills per month — see the next point.
 More cost: The $9.95 fee covers 20 pay-
ments per month. If you go over the limit,
your price increases at a rate of $2.49 for
each additional five transactions. So 21–25
transactions per month generate a $12.44
price tag, 26–30 transactions means you
pay $14.93, and so on.
 Timeliness, sort of: Quicken recommends
that if you’re making a tax payment or any
type of court-ordered payment, the type of
payment that absolutely positively has to be
paid on time, you best not use Bill Pay.
Hmmm. That doesn’t evoke a lot of confi-
dence in the program. I think the main mes-
sage here is that you shouldn’t wait until
the last minute to send a payment using this
program. Leave yourself some time, a bit of
a cushion between the date Bill Pay says
the bill will be paid and the actual due date.
The guarantee that Intuit makes for on-time
payments does not apply to tax payments
and court-ordered payments. I’m sure the
reasoning is that with these types of pay-
ments, a late payment can result in more
than just a slap on the wrist and a late fee,
and Intuit doesn’t want to assume the
responsibility for problems that might ensue
from paying these important payments late.

Setting up accounts in Bill Pay
If you haven’t yet done so, you must establish at least one bank account as
your bill-paying account. Doing so enables you to pay bills through Bill Pay
and access your funds in your bank account.
You can set up your account right in Quicken, or you can set up the account
through the Bill Pay Web site.
Set up a bank account from your Quicken program
Before you can activate an account for use with Quicken Bill Pay, the account
must have been activated for online transactions in general. If you need to
set up online access for your account, refer to Book II, Chapter 5, and then
come back here to set up the account for Bill Pay.
Oops, wait just a minute! Before you can activate a bank account for Quicken
Bill Pay, you must clear any transactions that you downloaded but have not
yet accepted into your register. Any downloaded transactions awaiting your
approval are sitting patiently at the bottom of your register screen. Clear
those transactions by accepting them (and editing if necessary). Click Done
when you’re finished, and then you’re ready to proceed with making your
account available to Quicken Bill Pay.
Here’s how to connect a bank account with Bill Pay from within the Quicken
program.
1. Display the bank account you want to use for online payments
Your accounts might be listed on the left side of your Quicken screen,
in the Account Bar. If so, click on the account you want to use. If your
accounts aren’t visible, press Ctrl+A to display the account list, and then
double-click on the account you want to view.

Let’s Sign Up to Pay Bills Online!
326
2. Click on the Overview tab that appears at the top of the account 
display.
3. Click on the Activate Quicken Bill Pay option.
The Quicken Account Setup window appears (Figure 4-4).
4. Enter your login information, which is the same login name and pass-
word you use on the Quicken Bill Pay Web site. Click Next when you’re
ready to proceed.
After the account is activated, the Online Center opens, ready to accept your
transactions.
Set up a bank account from the Bill Pay window
You can set up an account from your Quicken Bill Pay screen on the Internet —
you don’t have to be at your own computer to accomplish this.
1. After logging in to Quicken Bill Pay, click the Payment Accounts
option.
A list of the accounts you have already activated appears. A green dot
next to the account indicates that the account has been approved for
use in Bill Pay. A yellow dot indicates that approval is still pending —
you might have to contact your financial institution or Quicken Bill Pay
to determine why the account has not been approved.
2. Click the Add Payment Account hyperlink.
A Funding Account Information worksheet appears (Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-4:
Enter your
login
information.

327
3. Enter the information necessary for setting up your account.
You need to provide the name of your bank, a name you use to refer to
this account, the account number, the bank routing number, and a start-
ing check number that doesn’t duplicate check numbers you use in your
register.
4. Check the box that gives authorization to initiate debit entries at your
request.
At the bottom of the Funding Account Information window, check the
authorization check box to give Quicken authorization to take money
from your account when you make a Bill Pay request. Check this box, and
then click Continue. The account is added to your funding accounts list.
Setting up payees in Bill Pay
You’ve already established your account (or accounts) within Quicken Bill
Pay. Now it’s time to pay some bills! Before you can make a payment using
this service, you have to identify to whom each payment should be sent.
Follow along to see how this works.
1. Choose Online➪Quicken Bill Pay➪View and Pay Bills on the Web
from the Quicken menu.
The Bill Pay login window appears.
Figure 4-5:
Enter
account
information.

Let’s Sign Up to Pay Bills Online!
328
2. Enter your username and password, and then click the Login button.
If you’ve forgotten this information, you can enter your e-mail address
in the space provided and Quicken will e-mail the information to you.
When you log in, you are taken directly to the My Bills screen. Any bills
Quicken has received for you are listed, as are payments you entered
previously that are ready to dispatch.
3. To set up your first payee, click the Payee Setup option on the menu
bar (Figure 4-6).
The My Payees screen appears. Click the Add a Payee option. The Add a
Payee setup window appears (Figure 4-7).
Make it snappy — if you lollygag and take your time moving from window
to window within Bill Pay, Quicken logs you out and you have to log in
again. Not a problem; just a bit of an inconvenience. This process of log-
ging out is done to protect your account information in case you step
away from the computer for an unexpected period of time.
4. Enter the name of the payee.
Be careful when you enter the name. Make sure you spell the name 
correctly, and use the complete name, not an abbreviation (unless an
abbreviation is part of the name, such as Inc. or Ltd.). The name you
enter here is the name that appears on any payments that you instruct
Bill Pay to make.
Figure 4-6:
Click Payee

menu bar.

329
5. Enter an account number.
When you write a check by hand, you probably don’t think about writing
an account number on the check because you’re attaching the check to
the bill stub or a copy of the bill that is being paid. But when Bill Pay sends
a payment on your behalf, there’s no bill stub to attach to the check, so
the only way to identify the payment and get it to the right account is to
include the account number. Make sure you enter this number accurately.
You are limited to 22 characters including spaces.
If there is no account number (for example, if you’re setting up an indi-
vidual as a payee instead of a business), just enter your last name in the
account number field. There’s a check box where you can indicate that
there is no account number, but I think it makes more sense to just enter
your last name.
6. Enter the ZIP code.
Quicken requests that you enter the extended nine-digit ZIP code if this
information is available.
7. Enter a nickname.
What? A nickname for your payee? You can leave the name of the payee
in this field (the name fills in automatically), or you can enter a short-
ened name if you prefer.
Figure 4-7:
Enter info
about your
payee.

8. Select a category.
Enter the category that applies to this expense. If the category you want
to use doesn’t appear on the list, choose Add a New Category and enter
your new category.
9. Click Continue.
If Quicken is able to match the payee information you entered with other
information you entered previously, the address and phone number fill in
automatically. Otherwise, you are asked to enter the address and phone
number for this payee. When all the information is correct, click Continue.
If the payee is set up to communicate with Quicken Bill Pay, Quicken detects
this and sets the payee up for an e-payment relationship. Quicken requests
your online password information for this payee. After that is provided,
Quicken searches for outstanding bills from this payee and presents them 
to you in your Bills Inbox.
Most companies include a telephone number on their invoices, so you can
enter this number when Bill Pay requests information about the payee. But
what should you do if there is no phone number? I’ve only had this happen
once, and I just entered my own number. I figured that if someone at Bill Pay
has a problem with making this payment, they can just call me about it. I don’t
know if this is proper or not, but it got me through the data entry window.
At this point, you can continue setting up payees, or move on to the next
section if you’re ready to make a payment.
Time to pay your bills
If you have exited from Bill Pay, you need to get back into Bill Pay the same
way you did in steps one and two in the last section. You see a screen like
the one in Figure 4-6. This time, instead of setting up a payee, you’re going to
make a payment.
1. Click the Bills & Payments option on the toolbar, and then click Make
a Payment to Any Payee.
I’m assuming you’ve set up your payees already. If you haven’t yet set
up the person or company you’re going to pay, go back to the section
“Setting up payees in Bill Pay” and get your payee information entered,
and then come back — I’ll wait. After you’ve set up payees, your list of
payees appears when you execute step 1.
2. Enter the amount you want to pay next to the appropriate payee.
You can pay multiple bills at once — just enter the amount next to each
payee you want to pay (see Figure 4-8).
3. Verify the date. You can change the delivery date to any date later
than the date shown.

4. Click Make Payments to dispatch your payment(s).
A payment confirmation notice appears, indicating that your payments have
been moved to your Payment Outbox.
Important: The next time you download transactions for your bank, these
Bill Pay payments will be included with the batch of transactions.
Confirming your payments
It’s easy to make sure your payments have been made. Here are a couple of
different ways you can find out about your payment activity.
✦Click on the Bills & Payments option at the top of the Bill Pay screen.
The list of current payments appears in your Payment Outbox. Click on
the Payment Detail for any payment in the Outbox. Payment information
appears, showing you the date the payment was initiated, and the deliv-
ery date.
✦Click on Payee Setup. Then click on Payee Details for any payment you
want to track. Click on E-Mail Notifications at the top of the Payee Details
screen. Check the box to request an e-mail notification of when the pay-
ment is actually made (see Figure 4-9). Click Submit and then just watch
for the mail.

Intercepting online payments
When you make a payment in Quicken’s Bill Pay, you receive a notice that
your payments have been moved to the Outbox. You can click the hyperlink
on the Payment Outbox to see your pending payments.
Payments in the Outbox are waiting for their next destination. Either they
get dispatched to the intended payees, or, if you change your mind, you can
intercept the payments and prevent them from being sent.
In the Outbox, you can click on the Payment detail option (see Figure 4-10)
to see when the payment is scheduled to be sent. That gives you an idea of
how long the payment will be held in the Outbox. After a payment is sent,
you can’t intercept it.
As long as a payment appears in the Outbox, you can click the Edit option
to make changes in the payment, or the Stop option to prevent the payment
from occurring.
There is also a Notes option in the Payment Outbox. Clicking this option
opens a little window where you can enter personal notes about this pay-
ment. These notes are for your information only and are not sent with the
payment.

Getting fan mail from Intuit
You might have messages that need attention. At the very least, you should
have received a welcome message from Quicken Bill Pay. That’s very chummy
of them. Follow these steps to read your mail:
1. Click the Messages option on the Bill Pay tool bar.
Your Message Inbox appears (Figure 4-11).
2. Click the View hyperlink to read a message.
When the message appears, press Ctrl+P if you want to print the message.
Otherwise, scroll down to the bottom of the message for other options.
3. Choose your next action.
Pick from Back to My Messages if you want to go back to the main message
list, Delete message if you no longer need to save this message, or Create

Scheduling (and Unscheduling) Recurring Payments in Bill Pay

Scheduling (and Unscheduling) Recurring 
Payments in Bill Pay
In Book II, Chapter 2, you found out about scheduling payments in Quicken.
But guess what: You can also schedule recurring payments in Bill Pay. Bill
Pay actually pays bills, so you dispense with the middle-man (Quicken), and
get the bill paid directly from Bill Pay. Here’s how to set up a recurring pay-
ment in Bill Pay.
1. Open your payees list in Bill Pay.
Click the Payee Setup button in Bill Pay. Your Payee list appears. (There
are other ways to get to this list as well — any method will do.)
2. Click the Payee Details option next to a payee for whom you want to
create a recurring payment.
3. Click Payment Options.
The Change Payment Options window appears.
4. Choose a funding account.
First you are asked to choose a funding account. If you have set up more
than one online account in Bill Pay, and you plan on creating a recurring
payment, you need to indicate to which account the payments for this
payee are to be made.
5. Choose the Recurring payment option.
By default, the payment option is set to Manual, meaning the payee is
available for online payments through Bill Pay, but each payment is to
be authorized individually by you. Now you’re going to change that by
choosing the Recurring payment option (see Figure 4-12).
6. Enter the payment details.
Enter the amount of the recurring payment, the frequency with which the
payment is to be made, the date of the next payment, and the number of
payments. For a loan repayment or a mortgage, there will be a set number
of payments. For an ongoing service or recurring fee, there isn’t a fixed
number of payments, so you can leave the No. of Instances field blank.
7. Save your recurring payment information.
Click the Save Payment Options button to authorize the recurring 
payment.
After you set up recurring payments in Bill Pay, the payments are going to be
made automatically, without your approval. Double-check to make sure all of
the information is correct.

Chapter 4

Scheduling (and Unscheduling) Recurring Payments in Bill Pay
335
From now on, the recurring payment option, along with the amount of the
payment, appears in your payee list, as a constant reminder of the fact that
you’ve already taken care of having this payment made.
Maybe you’ve decided you really prefer writing checks the old-fashioned way.
Or maybe you’ve moved and no longer have that monthly rent payment. No
matter what the reason, if you’ve got a recurring payment going in Bill Pay,
especially one with an open-ended payment schedule, someday you might
need to cancel the payment. Here’s how:
1. Open up Quicken Bill Pay, and click on the Payee Setup option.
The goal here is to display your Payee List. When the list appears, you
can see at a glance where you have recurring payments.
2. Click on the recurring payment you want to terminate.
The recurring payments are hyperlinked, so you can click right on the
payment description (see Figure 4-13).
3. Switch the payment from Recurring to Manual.
The Change Payment Options window appears. All you really need to do
is click on Manual instead of Recurring. Me, I like to be extra sure I’ve got
all bases covered, so I go ahead and remove the amount that appears in
the Recurring section of the Payment Option window as well.
Figure 4-12:
Setting up a

payment.

Transferring Funds

4. Save your changes.
Click on Save Payment Options. The recurring payment is history. If you
want to make extra sure, you can follow the previous steps to click back
to those Payment Options, only to see that your recurring payment
information is completely obliterated.
Don’t forget about your recurring payments! My fear is that I’ll set up a recur-
ring payment in Bill Pay, and then just keep paying my Bill Pay fee each month
(Quicken automatically charges my credit card for this fee), and forget all
about the fact that I set up a recurring payment awhile back. I might be 80
years old and still sending in payments for my Wave Rider if I’m not careful.
Double-check amounts and decimal places when you enter bill payment
instructions in Bill Pay. Before you dispatch a payment request, make sure
you’ve entered the amount correctly. It’s easy to make a typographical error
that, left uncorrected, would result in your sending more (or less) money
than you intended to the recipient.
Transferring Funds
With Quicken’s Bill Pay service, you can arrange for a transfer of funds between
accounts. No big deal, you say? I can do this on my own bank’s Web site, you
Figure 4-13:
Click where
it says
Recurring
along with
the amount.

Chapter 4

say? Hah! I say. Maybe you can transfer funds between accounts on your bank’s
Web site, but can you transfer funds to another bank’s account on your bank’s
Web site? Probably not.
I have accounts at two different banks, and I love being able to move funds
between the banks right from my desktop. And when a friend needed a loan
last year, I was able to transfer the funds from my account to his, across the
country, without ever leaving my office.
Each of the accounts — the sending account and the receiving account —
must be set up in Quicken Bill Pay before you execute the transfer. So refer
back to “Setting up accounts in Bill Pay,” earlier in this chapter, if you need
to set up an account, and then follow these steps:
1. Click Account Transfers at the top of the Bill Pay window.
The Transfer Funds window appears, displaying a From field, a To field,
and an Amount field. Each of your authorized accounts is listed in the
From and To drop-down lists (Figure 4-14).
2. Choose the appropriate to and from accounts for the transfer.
3. Enter the amount of the transfer.
4. Click Continue.
Figure 4-14:
Transferring
funds is

Transferring Funds
338
5. Verify the transfer information, making sure the correct accounts
have been chosen and the amount is correct.
6. Click the Transfer button.
The transfer process is initiated. Unlike with bill payments, you can’t
intercept a transfer-in-progress (although you can transfer money back
in the other direction if you want to undo the transaction).
Bill Pay tells you that the transfer takes as many as four business days. I’ve
had luck with transfers going through more quickly than that.
Transfers are not automatically downloaded into Quicken like the bill pay-
ments are. You need to make an entry in your Quicken register yourself to
record any transfers you make through Bill Pay.

Chapter 5: Budgeting in Quicken
In This Chapter
 Creating a budget
 Revising a budget
 Using a budget
You probably think that using a budget to predict and control your spend-
ing is a lot like that movie where alien creatures drop in from outer space
and hypnotize the children and the rats by playing a sweet tune . . . wait,
sorry. What I meant to say is that you probably think budgeting is a combina-
tion of science fiction and children’s stories — and you’re absolutely right.
The science fiction part is that you’re actually expected to be able to figure
out what you’re going to earn and spend in the next year — or the next five
years if you really go crazy with budgeting. The children’s story part is that
there’s a sweet innocence tied to the concept of setting a budget, getting up
the determination to stick to it, and congratulating yourself when you accom-
plish your task.
Before you go any further in this chapter, I recommend you flip back to Book I,
Chapter 3, a chapter that explains what a budget is and gives recommenda-
tions about how you and your family members can actually create a budget.
Why? Although Quicken is a great place to store your budget numbers and
gives your budget an excellent starting point by showing you how much you
earned and spent in the past, the true future budget planning goes on outside
of Quicken: in your thoughts, conversations across the dinner table, in bed at
night, or wherever else you are when you think about money.
Creating an Automatic Budget with Quicken
So, now that you’ve read up on budgeting and have had some time to think
about what amounts you actually might want to put in your budget, it’s time
to dig in and start making a budget! You can fine-tune the process later, after
you’ve got the basics down pat. Start by choosing Budget from the Planning
menu. If you’ve played with this feature before, your existing budget infor-
mation appears. For you first-timers, Figure 5-1 is the screen you see when
you initially request the budget command.
Right off the bat, you have two choices. Choosing Automatic enables Quicken
to start you off on a budget using your actual income and expense items
that already exist based on all the entries you’ve entered in Quicken. Picking

Creating an Automatic Budget with Quicken
340
Manual starts your budget with a blank screen. That’s right. You get no help
if you pick Manual. Guess which one I’m going to pick for this example? You
guessed it: Choose Automatic.
Seriously, choosing Manual isn’t just for those who like to do things the 
hard way. If you earn income irregularly, or your expenses vary greatly
from month to month, setting up an automatic budget might not be for you.
You might find it easier to simply set up your budget manually, rather than
making extensive changes to the budget that Quicken creates automatically.
If you fall into this category, flip ahead to the section entitled, “Using the
Manual Method for Creating Your Budget.”
If you open the Budget window and your existing budget appears, click the
Setup tab, and then choose Automatic for your new budget. Because a
budget already exists, you are required to give this new budget a name to
distinguish it from the old budget before you can continue.
Now that you’ve chosen the Automatic route for creating your budget, click
the Create Budget button and away we go.
Keep in mind the fact that the budget Quicken prepares is going to be for
an entire year. The information you provide is going to be spread over the
upcoming year as your preliminary budget, based on the method and dates
you select.
Figure 5-1:
Welcome to
your first

Book IV
Chapter 5

Choosing your date range
After clicking the Create Budget button in the window shown in Figure 5-1,
the Create Budget window appears. You are expected to enter a range of
dates for your budget, as I’ve done in Figure 5-2. Quicken uses the amounts
that fall in that date range to establish your preliminary budget amounts.
Allow me to elaborate on a few of these phrases.
First, range of dates means a beginning and end date, and all the dates in
between. If you choose March 1 to March 31 as your range, Quicken is going
to mimic everything you entered for the month of March, and make up a
whole budget for the year based on what you earned and what you spent in
March. If you pick dates that span five years, Quicken averages your income
and expense activity for the entire five-year period and makes up a budget
based on those averages. The idea is to try to pick a range of dates that rep-
resent a typical period of time for analyzing your income and expenses.
Next, amounts that fall in that date range refers to everything, monetarily-
speaking, that you already entered in your Quicken register for the range of
dates that you select. Even though Quicken is made by a company called
Intuit, and you might therefore think that this program ought to be intuitive,
Quicken is just plain incapable of rummaging around in your desk drawer
and getting out your checkbook or your old bank statements, and basing
your budget on information in those records. You have to have actually
entered the information in your Quicken register for your past financial
activity to be considered in the creation of the budget.
Finally, the phrase preliminary budget amounts means that Quicken is going
to come up with a budget for you, and that budget is preliminary, meaning
the budget is just a dry run and you can change the numbers to amounts
that seem more reasonable after you take a look at them. Here’s a good
example of something you might want to change. Perhaps you bought a lot-
tery ticket and won $5,000 in July of last year. If you base your budget on the
Figure 5-2:
Enter some
introductory
budget
setup
information. 

Creating an Automatic Budget with Quicken
342
activity from last year, that lottery income is going to show up as a budgeted
amount for next year. In other words, you’re telling yourself that you have to
win $5,000 from the lottery next year. Although winning from the lottery per-
haps is a worthy goal, it probably shouldn’t be a budgeted amount because,
correct me if I’m wrong, the odds of winning $5,000 from the lottery are not
as great as, say, the odds of spending $5,000 on lottery tickets in hopes of
winning another $5,000. So as you can see, the budget might need some fine-
tuning once you see the preliminary numbers.
Choose a budget method
You get to pick — would you like Quicken to take the average of the amounts
from your date range for creating a new budget, or do you want to use exact
amounts? Here’s a comparison of the methods:
✦Average: Your budget is based on the average of all the income and
expenses that fall into the date range you selected. If you entered just one
month in your date range, that month’s financial activity serves as the
basis for your annual budget for every month. If you selected an entire
year in your date range, the amounts for all 12 months are added together,
and then divided by 12 to come up with monthly budgeted amounts for
the coming year. But wait! You’re not limited to averaging a month or a
year. You can request a daily average, bi-weekly, quarterly, semi-annually,
and so on. Click the drop-down arrow to determine the time frame of
income and expenses that you want to average for your budget.
✦Monthly: Quicken uses the actual amounts from the corresponding
months in your date range to complete your budget.
✦Quarterly: Again, Quicken uses actual amounts instead of averages for
completing your budget. In this case, the amounts are chosen from each
quarter instead of each month in the date range you provide. If you only
specify one quarter in the date range, that quarter is repeated for each
quarter of the year you are budgeting.
Pick some budget options
Before you proceed, you need to make a couple of selections from the
Budget Options setup category. You get to pick how you want your numbers
to be rounded, and whether to include one-time transactions.
✦Rounding: Quicken lets you select a method of rounding — you can
have your budget numbers rounded to the nearest dollar, the nearest
$10, or the nearest $100. For example, if it works out that last year you
spent $3,943.44 on groceries, that results in an average of $328.62 per
month for grocery spending.
If you’re using a monthly average for your budget computation, and 
you choose to round your budgeted items to the nearest dollar, Quicken
assigns a monthly budgeted amount of $329 for groceries. If you choose to

Book IV
Chapter 5
Budgeting
in Quicken
Creating an Automatic Budget with Quicken
343
round to the nearest $10, your monthly budgeted amount for groceries is
$330. And if you round to the nearest $100, you get $300 as your monthly
budget for groceries.
Or, you cannot round at all, and use the exact amount of your prior year
spending as your budgeted amount for the next year.
If you want to choose a rounding option, check the Rounding box in the
Options section that appears in Figure 5-2, and then choose from the
options in the drop-down list.
✦One-time transactions: When you base your budget on last year’s finan-
cial activity, Quicken goes back over the past year and computes aver-
ages to use in this year’s budget. But what if you wrote a check last year
for a down payment on a new car? This is probably an expense that
you’re not going to need in next year’s budget. For items like this, it’s
handy to have the option to exclude one-time transactions from the
budget computation.
On the other hand, maybe you pay for life insurance or auto insurance
with one payment, once a year. Even though the payment is made only
once a year, that’s a recurring event; every year, you need to pay for
insurance again. For this type of one-time transaction, it might make
sense to budget for the amount all year long, setting aside money each
month instead of having to come up with a large amount of cash all at
once for the annual payment. So if this is the type of one-time transaction
you have, you may want to include these transactions in your budget.
To have Quicken omit one-time transactions from your budget, check
the Exclude One-Time Transactions box in the Options section shown in
Figure 5-2. Leave the box unchecked if you want to include your one-
time transactions in next year’s budget.
Just because you don’t want Quicken to average your one-time transac-
tions and spread the amount through each month of your budget doesn’t
mean you can’t include these transactions in your budget. Check the
Exclude One-Time Transactions box to have Quicken exclude the trans-
actions, and then when you get your hands on the actual budget (see
“Fine-tuning your budget” later in this chapter), you can add the one-
time transactions in the actual months when they should occur.
You’ve finished entering your options choices, but don’t click OK yet —
you’ve got to take one more step before you’re ready to proceed.
Choose categories for your budget
Before you leave the Create Budget: Automatic window, click the Categories
button. The Choose Categories window appears (Figure 5-3). Scroll through
the list, clicking to uncheck any of the categories that you don’t need to use
in your budget computation.

Creating an Automatic Budget with Quicken
344
If you find there are more categories you don’t need than the ones that you
do need, try clicking the Clear All button to uncheck everything, and then
just check the categories you want.
When you see lots of categories that you don’t need, that’s an indication that
you should probably clean out your category list, getting rid of categories
that were on the original list Quicken gave you, but that you never use.
Check back to Book II, Chapter 1 for advice on cleaning out the rubbish in
your category list.
You might have categories on your list that you used in the past, but no
longer need. These aren’t categories that are slated for removal; they’re
just categories you don’t need to include in your budget going forward.
Just because you spent money on landscaping last year doesn’t mean
you’re going to spend that money next year. Just pick the categories you
plan to use in the coming year.
You can quickly exclude all categories that have zero for their amount. In the
Choose Categories window (Figure 5-4), click the Clear 0 Amounts button to
remove categories that have a zero balance. Remember, however, that even
if there is a zero balance in the month of the budget you’re viewing onscreen,
there might not be a zero in another month during the year. This month’s
zeros (a good name for a rock band) might be next month’s insurance
payments — the Clear 0 option won’t remove a category if there is an actual
balance somewhere down the line.
When you finish choosing the categories you want to include in your budget,
click OK to close the Choose Categories window, and then click OK in the
Create Budget: Automatic window. Quicken sifts through your transactions
for the date range you provided and comes up with a preliminary budget for
the next year.

Fine-tuning your budget
Now that you have a preliminary budget to work with, you can start examin-
ing your budget up close, making adjustments in individual categories and
months, so that the final budget is as close to true expectations as possible.
The budget window has five tabs across the top, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Click through the various budget tabs to explore the budgeted amounts
Quicken has provided for you.

✦Setup: This is the back-to-the-drawing-board tab. If you want to try a dif-
ferent budget scenario, you can click the Setup tab and start all over
again by clicking the Start Over button. Start Over erases your current
budget and replaces the information with a completely new budget. You
can also click Rename to give your budget a different name, you can open
a different budget, or make a copy of your current budget as a starting
point for another budget. Use the Create Budget button if you want to
keep your current budget and create another budget.
✦Income: Click the Income tab, and any of the categories you budgeted
that relate to income appear here, along with the amount you’ve bud-
geted and the monthly average. Note: If you requested that your budget
be created as a monthly budget, the budget and the monthly average
amounts are most likely going to be the same.
✦Expenses: The Expenses tab displays all of the expenses you selected in
your budget setup. Budgeted amounts are displayed as negative numbers.
✦Savings: If part of your budget includes transferring money to any of your
savings categories, the budget for those transfers appears on this tab.
✦Summary: See a total of everything you budgeted, one year’s worth
compiled by month. Click on a particular month, and then click the
Details button to see the complete budget of income and expenses and
transfers to savings for that month. In addition, there is a graph feature
on the Summary page that provides a visual representation of how your
income and expenses are budgeted. Click the drop-down list in the
graph section to choose from an income-related graph, an expense-
related graph, or graphs that show non-discretionary spending and dis-
cretionary spending.
Non-discretionary spending is required spending. Food is non-discretionary,
as is your rent or mortgage, medical expenses, basic clothing, and any 
other expenses you’ve committed to such as college costs or pet care.
Discretionary spending is money you don’t have to spend. Although food 
is non-discretionary, restaurant food is discretionary. Rent or mortgage is
non-discretionary, but the cost of a vacation home is discretionary.
Discretionary spending is the spending you can limit if you’re having trouble
meeting the non-discretionary expenses in your budget.
Change any budgeted amounts. Changes are easy to make. Say you know
you’re going to start receiving interest income in July when you expect to
transfer a windfall over to savings. On the Income tab, click on Interest
Income in the Category/Amount section, and then select the Monthly Detail
radio button over in the method section on the right (refer to Figure 5-5).
Enter the estimated interest income you expect to receive in the months
when you think you’ll receive it. Click the Apply button to inject your
changes into the budget.

Book IV

347
The Apply button isn’t available unless you make a change in at least one of
the monthly slots.
Perhaps you pay your auto insurance quarterly instead of monthly and you
want to record the insurance that way. Click on the Expenses tab, and then
click Auto: Insurance. Change the payment amount to one-fourth of the total
in the four months when you plan to make a payment, change the rest of the
months to zero, and then click Apply.
Adding missing categories
If, while choosing your categories for your budget, you find that the category
you want to use doesn’t appear on the list, click the Options button at the
top of the Budget window, and then choose Go to Category List. The budget
is minimized, and the category list appears. You can add any categories you
need, and then click the X in the upper-right corner to close the category
list. The budget window can be restored by clicking the Budget icon that
appears at the bottom of your Quicken screen.
Your budget list might show categories with plus or minus signs next to the
title. These are the standard expand and collapse buttons. Click all the plus
signs to hide the detail and display only the main categories on your budget.
Click the minuses, and you see the detail beneath the main category headings.
Printing your budget
At any time, and from any tab, you can print a copy of your budget by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Click the Print button that appears above the tabs.
The Print window appears (Figure 5-6).
Figure 5-6:

fications

2. Click Preview to see how your budget appears.
In the Print Preview window that appears, you can page through your
budget, zoom in or out, and Print by clicking the Print button at the top
of the Preview screen.
3. If you close the Preview window without printing, you need to reopen
the Print window.
4. Make any print modifications, such as changing from portrait to land-
scape, making your budget fit in one page wide, or printing to an Excel-
compatible file so that you can work with your budget in a spreadsheet. 
If you choose to print to an Excel-compatible file, choose Export To, and
then ASCII Disk File.
5. Click OK when you’re ready to print.
Important: The budget prints out with a separate column for each month.
This is a great format, especially if income or expense amounts vary from
month to month. You can make notations on the pages for use in family
budget meetings or just for your own information so you know what caused
you to veer from your budget.
Saving your budget
Just as with any information you enter in your Quicken program, your budget
is automatically saved as you work on it. You don’t need to take any special
steps to save your budget.
Using the Manual Method for Creating Your Budget
The automatic method for creating a budget works really well if your income
and expenses stay pretty much the same, month in and month out. But what
about the person whose income is earned sporadically, or someone who
doesn’t pay the same thing every month for expenses? That person finds
that the automatic method of creating a budget produces a budget that
requires lots and lots of changes.
Instead of changing the numbers in an automatic budget, try starting from
scratch, with zero amounts in all of your budgeted categories, and filling in
how much you expect to earn and spend each month.

Students might prefer the manual method of creating a budget, especially
that first year out of school. An FOC (Fresh Outta College) has tuition and
housing and job-hunting expenses the first five or six months, perhaps fol-
lowed by some time off living at home or traveling, and then maybe by job
income and new types of expenses related to a new job.
On the budget start-up screen, choose Manual instead of Automatic. Quicken
takes you right into the main budget window, with the tabs for Setup (not
necessary because you’re using Manual setup), Income, Expenses, Savings,
and Summary, just like you saw before. The big difference, however, is that
there are no amounts in any of the windows. There aren’t even any categories
listed. This is total start-from-scratch budgeting.
When you begin your manual budget, you might be asked to give this budget
a name and description. This step enables Quicken to distinguish this
budget from any other budget you’ve already worked on.
It helps to have a written budget prepared on paper, or at least some notes
where you’ve contemplated what you expect to earn and what types of
expenses you think you’ll encounter in the year ahead. You can use this
information to help get yourself started.
Here are the steps to follow when creating a budget manually:
1. When you’re in the budget window, click the Income tab, and then
click the Choose Categories button at the bottom of the window.
The list of all your Quicken categories appears.
2. Check off the categories you want to include in your budget.
Remember: The Mark All and Clear All buttons are available to make the
job easier.
3. Click OK when you have selected all of your categories.
You need to choose categories on each tab separately. When you select
the Income tab and click Choose Categories, only income categories
appear. From the Expenses tab, only expense categories appear.
Likewise, on the Savings tab, you only see your bank accounts, asset
accounts, and other investment accounts.
4. Quicken populates the tabs with the categories you choose, but all the
amounts are zero (Figure 5-7).

Using the Manual Method for Creating Your Budget
350
Click a category, and then use the boxes at the right of the budget list to
enter an amount, and choose a frequency for that amount (anywhere from
daily to yearly or any frequency in between). In the example in Figure 5-7,
I’ve entered $85 per month as my Auto–Fuel cost. Click the Apply button to
enter the amount, and then repeat this step for each budget item you want
to create.
Use the Analyze button to help you set up your budget. Click the Analyze
button to display a graph and summary of any previous activity you’ve
entered in Quicken.
While you’re busy creating your budget, don’t overlook the budget alert fea-
ture. Nestled at the bottom-right corner of the expense tab of the budget
window is the Alert area. For any budgeted amount, including amounts you
leave at zero, you can set an alert to have Quicken tell you when your spend-
ing exceeds the budget by whatever amount you designate.
In Figure 5-8, I’ve set an alert to have Quicken give me a little nudge when my
automobile fuel costs go over $100 per month. Just check the box in the
Alert area of the window, and enter the amount. If you prefer, you can enter a
percentage in lieu of an amount.

How to Use a Budget in Everyday Life
I’m going to refer you back to Book I, Chapter 3 to read about how budgets
are actually used. Rather than being redundant about all the ways you can
use a budget, I’m going to give you something a little different in this section.
I give you some information here on how to use Quicken to see the budget
you created and your budget progress, and I’ve got some un-tips for what
not to do with your budget. I also offer just a few concluding remarks about
how cool budgets really are once you get the hang of them.
Producing budget reports
What good is a budget if you can’t tell whether or not you’re meeting your
budget goals? Use the budget reports that come with Quicken to monitor
your progress and then, if necessary, either make changes in your financial
activities or make changes in your budget.
Quicken provides two reporting tools — the Budget Report and the Monthly
Budget Report. The reports are similar, except that the Budget Report shows
your year-to-date activity, and the monthly report gives you a separate set of
columns for each month.
Figure 5-8:
Set an alert
to monitor
your
spending.

How to Use a Budget in Everyday Life
352
From the Budget window, click the Reports option at the top, and then choose
Budget Report. If you prefer to use the menus, click the Reports menu and go
to the Reports and Graphs Center, and then click the How Am I Spending My
Money? option. Next click on the Budget Report, and then click the Show
Report button.
If you don’t like the dates Quicken has chosen for your report, you can
change them to a more appropriate selection, such as Year to Date, Quarter
to Date, or Last Month. There are several available date options, accessible
from the Date Range drop-down menu at the top of the report.
The report includes an Actual column, where the actual income and
expenses that you have reported to Quicken are listed. Next is a Budget
column that displays your budgeted amounts for the same period of time as
you have chosen for your actual amounts. Finally there is a column that dis-
plays the amount of difference between the actual amounts and the bud-
geted amounts. Negative differences (where you either didn’t earn as much
as you budgeted or spent more than you budgeted) are shown in red.
One problem with the standard Budget Report is that non-budgeted cate-
gories do not appear. For example, maybe you spent a lot of money in a cate-
gory that you neglected to include on your budget. I think this happens most
often when you copy a budget from a prior year to use as a starting point for
a new budget. You might have added categories during the year without real-
izing that they need to be added to your budget. You can circumvent this
problem by clicking the Customize button on your budget report, and then
clicking the Advanced tab. There is an option under Categories to choose
Include All instead of the default, Budgeted Only.
When examining your budget reports, be sure to analyze them from a logical
point of view as well as an analytical point of view. If an amount looks out of
line, or if something seems to be missing from the report, don’t automatically
assume the report is right. Dig a little, find out where the numbers originated,
and make sure you’ve got accurate information in your report. For example,
you might have posted one or more transactions to the wrong category.
Customizing your budget report
Customize the Budget Report if you want to by changing the date range at
the top of the report. Instead of year-to-date, maybe you only want to see
quarter-to-date or month-to-date or some other selection of dates. Click the
Customize button and the Customize Budget window appears (Figure 5-9).
The Display tab of the Customize window gives you the option to assign a
different name to your budget. You can check the box to show cents instead
of rounding to the nearest dollar. You can also control column headings,
select a different budget to use for comparison purposes, and choose from
three different types of report organization. Report organization options

include Cash Flow, which organizes your budget items by cash inflows and
outflows; Income and Expense, which organizes by income categories and
expense categories; or Category Group, which organizes your report by dis-
cretionary and non-discretionary spending categories.
Discretionary and non-discretionary designations can be assigned to a cate-
gory when you create a new category. For existing categories, you can desig-
nate whether the category is discretionary by selecting an expense category
on the category list (found on the Tools menu or by pressing Ctrl+C) and
then editing that category. There is a check box for discretionary categories
on the Setup and Edit page for each expense.
You can click other tabs in the Customize window to choose which accounts,
categories, classes, and category groups to include in your report. For more
about customizing reports, see Chapter 3 of Book VII.
Viewing the Monthly Budget Report
Much like the Budget Report, only with more detail, the Monthly Budget
Report presents you with a set of three columns for each month. This is a
massive report, especially if it’s close to the end of the year and you’re look-
ing at 12 or so months worth of data, meaning 39 or so columns of numbers.
Unless you’ve got a really big monitor, you probably need to use the scroll
bar at the bottom to see all the columns in the report.
For each month, you get a column of your actual income and expenses, a
column for the budgeted amount, and a column showing the difference.
Then at the far right side of the report, there are the three columns summa-
rizing the year-to-date activity.
Figure 5-9:

Thinking About Different Types of Budgets
354
Just like with the other Budget Report, you can customize the monthly
report by requesting a particular date range, or clicking the Customize
button and choosing exactly which accounts and categories you want to ana-
lyze and which budget you want to use for comparison purposes.
Thinking About Different Types of Budgets
Quicken is flexible and allows you to create a budget that is just what you
need. When you start using the budget feature, the obvious and easiest
method for creating a budget is to take every income item and every expense,
and budget the same amount every month, based on last year’s activity. That’s
all well and good, but how about trying some of these scenarios instead? They
might be just what the doctor ordered in terms of actually helping you get a
handle on your finances.
✦The Carefully Selected Category Budget: Earlier in this chapter, you
discovered how to pick and choose categories for your budget, adding
the ones you need and disconnecting the ones you don’t need. When
you’re working with a budget of all of your income and expenses, you
may well have had some expenses last year that won’t occur again next
year. Maybe you bought a dog, or had some cosmetic surgery, land-
scaped the yard, took a vacation, or attended a seminar. By picking and
choosing your categories carefully, you can weed out the ones that don’t
belong in your new budget.
✦The Business Budget: Do you own your own business? Do you have a
hobby that is about to turn profitable? Or are you thinking about start-
ing a business next year? Create a budget where the only categories are
those that relate to your business. Don’t hesitate to create new cate-
gories for income and expense areas that you haven’t used in the past.
Your business budget is of particular interest to anyone who is consider-
ing investing in or loaning money for the business.
✦The Classy Budget: Use classes (described in Book VIII) to separate finan-
cial transactions by members of the family, to distinguish between differ-
ent family business ventures, to track income and expenses that relate to
different jobs, or any other creative way you can imagine to analyze your
financial activity. You can click the Customize button on your budget
reports and click the tab labeled Classes to indicate which classes you
want to report in your budget. In this way, you can produce a report that
only displays the budget items for the class you choose.
✦The Specific Category Budget: Who says you have to create a budget that
shows all of your income and expenses when what you really want is a
budget for just your medical expenses? In the Budget Setup window,
choose only the categories that relate to medical expenses (or whatever
other type of category you want to report on), excluding everything else.

Seven Ways Not to Use a Budget
355
Seven Ways Not to Use a Budget
You can benefit from using a budget in lots of ways, but here are some
budget techniques that are not recommended:
✦Don’t rely on the budget alone to get the job done. A budget is a tool
for helping you monitor your income and spending. Earning the income
and keeping the spending in line is still your responsibility.
✦Don’t try to pass your budget off as a financial statement. If you’re apply-
ing for a loan, your financial institution is going to ask you for financial
statements. Although a budget can be included with the entire package
you give to your potential lender, the lender is really looking for your
actual income and spending activity. The income/expense statement and
net worth statement are more interesting and useful to your banker than a
budget.
✦Know that your budget isn’t the law. Sometimes unbudgeted events
occur. Live with it. You can do your best to predict your financial circum-
stances, but you can’t always control life. Understand that your budget
needs to be flexible and that you might need to make budgetary changes
during the course of the year.
✦Don’t change the budget to meet every whim. In spite of what I just
said in the previous statement, your budget isn’t going to be very useful
if you change it every time your income or expenses don’t agree with the
budgeted amounts. Analyze the differences, make sure you understand
what caused them, but try to get back on track. Remember: You can use
future months to make up for problems in months gone by.
✦Don’t get mad at your budget. Remember, the budget is an inanimate
object. Hurling squishy vegetables at the computer screen or shouting
obscenities at your budget won’t improve the situation. Try to remem-
ber that you need to figure out the problem of why the budget isn’t
working and find a way to get back on track.
✦Don’t think of your budget as an albatross, dragging you down, pre-
venting you from spending money on items you want or need. In truth,
the budget should have the opposite effect. Keep tabs on your budgeted
categories, and see when the money is available for spending. By follow-
ing your budget, you know when it’s OK to spend.
✦Don’t use the budget to start family feuds. Especially because you’re
getting this information from me. The last thing I want to hear is that
families are arguing because “Gail Perry said we should follow our
budget and not buy theatre tickets when the bills haven’t been paid.”
C’mon! Make budgeting a positive experience!

’m sure some psychologists somewhere have run tests where they say
words such as “tax” and “IRS” to see what kind of brain patterns appear
on computer scanners — the results are probably too scary to publish. For
most people, taxes are at least a source of concern, if not downright fear and
loathing. Allow Quicken to make it easier for you to get a grip on your taxes,
and leave the scary stuff to people like Stephen King and Roger Corman.
Poking Around in the Quicken Tax Center
To open the Tax Center, choose Tax➪Go To Tax Center. Welcome to the Tax
Center! Quicken opens up the Financial Overview page with the Tax tab
selected (Figure 1-1). Here’s a selection of what you can find in the Tax
Center.
✦Tax Alerts: You can ask Quicken to give you a nudge when a major tax
event is about to occur. You might not have any trouble remembering
that the federal tax return is due on April 15, but what about those
pesky quarterly payments? You can also ask Quicken to monitor your
tax withholding on your paycheck and let you know if the withholding
looks like it’s going to be too much or too little. Quicken can give you
alerts about tax deductions you might not have thought about. See
“Alert! Alert! Incoming Tax Payments!” later in this chapter for informa-
tion on how to set tax alerts in Quicken.
Having too much tax withheld doesn’t get you into trouble, at least not
with the tax authorities. On the other hand, having too little tax with-
held can spell big trouble because you can run the risk of having to pay
penalties.

Poking Around in the Quicken Tax Center
360
✦Tax Planner: Without your even having to ask, Quicken has created a
little tax planner for you, rifling through your expense accounts and
coming up with a guess of how much tax you’re going to owe or how
much of a refund you can expect in the spring. More information about
the tax planner is coming up in Chapter 5 of this book.
✦Tax Calendar: The IRS doesn’t mess around when it comes to due dates
for tax returns and tax payments. In addition to the alerts you can create
in Quicken, keep an eye on the tax calendar so you won’t forget to keep
your nice old Uncle Sam happy.
The tax alerts available in Quicken are pre-set, meaning you can’t add
your own tax-related alerts to the tax alerts list. If you have made arrange-
ments to make tax payments on dates different from the regular quarterly
payment dates, or if you have state tax payments due on a date different
from the federal quarterly payments, you can create a calendar alert
or a Billminder reminder, but you can’t add a tax alert to cover these
situations.
✦Tax-Related Expenses YTD: Quicken keeps a little list for you of the
expenses that might generate tax deductions, summarizing how much
you’ve spent in each of these categories thus far in the current year. See
“Adding categories to the Tax-Related Expenses list” later in this chapter
for instructions for expanding this list.

✦Taxable Income YTD: The counterpart to the list of taxable expenses is
the list of taxable income items. This list displays the detail that makes
up your taxable income. Make additions (or deletions) to this list as nec-
essary and as described later in this chapter, so that the list provides a
clear summary of all of your taxable income.
✦Tools, Reports, Tips, TurboTax: On the right side of your Tax Center
screen are hyperlinks to a variety of tax tools, reports, and help items.
Sift through these at your leisure, when you’re interested in reading
more about taxes (and aren’t we all interested in reading about taxes all
the time?). I cover them in this chapter as well.
What’s Taxable, What’s Not
If only I had about 5,000 extra pages in this book, I could include the U.S. Tax
Code, but trust me, even with the entire code in hand, most people still don’t
know what’s taxable and what’s not. That’s because for every rule, there are
exceptions, gyrations, emanations, explanations, right ways and wrong ways,
tried and true ways, black and blue ways, ways and means, tangos and hus-
tles, and more new tax laws coming our way every year.
But the limited size of this book won’t stop me from trying. Herewith, my
capsule analysis of what you need to know about the tax laws.
Sharing the fruits of your labors
with your dear old Uncle Sam
Quicken displays your taxable income year-to-date in the Tax Center section
appropriately called Taxable Income YTD. If it doesn’t look like all of your
income is showing up in this section, that doesn’t mean you get to exclude
the missing income from your income tax return; it just means that Quicken
hasn’t found out about all of your sources of income yet. Chapter 2 of this
book goes into more detail about how to set up your categories so that they
appear properly in the Tax Center.
The easiest way to explain how to tax income is that, if you think it might be
taxable, it probably is. Most of the money you receive is taxable. That includes
the obvious stuff like income from jobs, interest on your savings account, and
dividends on stock investments. In the next section, I’ve listed some other
examples of common types of taxable income and not-so-taxable income.
Keep track of the following types of income in Quicken because chances are,
you’re going to see them again when you fill out your tax return. I’m going to
go right down the front page of the federal income tax return with a quick
explanation of the most familiar forms of income.

What’s Taxable, What’s Not
362
✦Income you earn at work, which is reported to you by your employer on
a W-2 form.
✦Interest on savings accounts and interest you receive from money you
loaned — most of this interest (but not all) is reported to you on a 1099-
INT form.
✦Dividends on stocks you own and investments in money market funds
and mutual funds. Most of the dividends are reported on 1099-DIV forms,
or on the year-end report you receive from the fund in which you own
shares.
✦Income you earn at a business or farm you own. Expenses that are
directly related to the business offset this income.
✦Profit on the sale of items you own, including tangible items like stamps
and coins and vintage cars as well as shares of stocks and mutual funds.
✦Amounts you receive from a pension, IRA, Social Security, or other
source of retirement income. Sometimes these amounts aren’t taxable.
Sometimes they are.
✦Unemployment compensation.
✦The odds and ends of income like jury duty, director’s fees, insurance
proceeds (sometimes these amounts aren’t taxable), certain grants and
fellowships, and so on (that’s technical accountant language for, “I’m not
ruling out anything until I check my 5,000 page tax code to find out if it’s
taxable or not”).
Like I said, tax laws give new meaning to the term confusing. Check with a
tax professional before making any final decisions on what amounts to put
on your tax return. Meanwhile, use Quicken to store and report all of your
income.
Money you receive as a loan isn’t really your money, so you don’t have to
pay tax on it. Tax on money you receive as a gift or inheritance presumably
was already paid by its former owner, and you don’t have to pay tax on it
either. But remember the golden rule of taxation — there’s always a catch.
There are times when you do have to pay tax on these sorts of monies, so be
sure to check in with your friendly tax professional.
I spent it, so it must be deductible, right?
I’m afraid that calculating tax deductions is a bit more complicated than
simply adding up everything you spent and writing that on the tax return.
Although the tax code allows you to reduce your income by certain expendi-
tures before tax is calculated, those expenditures must fall into particular
categories, and even those categories come with rules and limitations.

Book V
Chapter 1
The Quicken
Tax Center
What’s Taxable, What’s Not
363
Once again, remember that this is just a generalization, but here is a list of
common tax deductions that you might be able to use to lower the income
on which tax is calculated. You have to be able to itemize your deductions
on Schedule A of the federal income tax return in order to take advantage of
these methods to reduce your taxable income.
✦Medical expenses: Most things medical qualify as a tax deduction, includ-
ing doctor and dentist expenses, hospital costs, health insurance (as long
as it hasn’t already been paid with before-tax money), lab fees, ambulance
rides, stop-smoking programs, and so on. Unfortunately, the amount you
deduct is first reduced by 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income.
Adjusted gross income = all the money you received during the past
year, reduced by certain special adjustments like money invested in tax-
deferred retirement funds, moving expenses, interest paid on student
loans, alimony you paid, one-half of your self-employment tax, and 100
percent of your health insurance if you’re self-employed.
✦Tax expenses: You get to deduct amounts you paid for state and local
income tax, such as the amounts that were withheld from your paycheck
during the year. Also if you paid real estate tax or any other type of prop-
erty tax, that counts as a deduction.
✦Interest expenses: You can deduct the amount of interest paid on your
home mortgage.
✦Charitable contributions: Give money to charity, take a deduction. Give
stuff to charity, you also get to take a deduction, but look for Congress
to limit the stuff-giving deduction in the near future.
✦Miscellaneous deductions: The IRS allows you to deduct a variety of
odd and ends, but first you have to reduce the amount of your miscella-
neous expenses by 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. If there’s
anything left over, you get the deduction. Miscellaneous deductions
include unreimbursed business-related employee expenses, tax prepara-
tion fees, job search costs, and education costs that relate to your job.
✦Casualty losses: If you are the victim of a theft, or if you suffer a casualty
such as damage from a flood or an earthquake or an alien attack from
outer space, and if your insurance doesn’t reimburse you for your dam-
ages, you might get to deduct some of the amount you lost. First, you have
to have lost more than $100 worth of cash or stuff, or else the IRS doesn’t
want to hear about it. Second, the amount you deduct has to be reduced
by 10 percent of your adjusted gross income. Anything left over?
Adding categories to the Tax-Related Expenses list
In the Tax Center, Quicken assembles your tax deductions in the area labeled
Tax-Related Expenses YTD. You can monitor your year-to-date deductible

spending in this section. You can also add or remove categories to this list
by designating your categories as being tax-related.
This category assignment is covered in more detail in Chapter 2 of this book,
but for now, if you want to add a tax category to the Tax-Related Expenses
list, click the Assign Tax Categories button beneath the list, find the category
you want to add in the category list that appears, and put a check in the Tax
column to the right of that category. When you close the category list, that
category gets added to the Tax-Related Expenses list.
Cut your taxes in other ways
You can reduce your taxes in other ways, the most famous of which is to
earn less money. Having children is another good way to cut taxes, although
there are other expenses like diapers and college education (in that order,
one hopes) that take the place of all the tax money you save.
Want to read more about how to figure out what’s taxable and what’s not?
You can pick up a copy of the U.S. Tax Code in a nice coffee-table edition, or
you can get a copy of Taxes 2006 For Dummies by Eric Tyson, Margaret A.
Munro, and David J. Silverman (Wiley Publishing). And by the way, the pur-
chase of either of these books is a tax-deductible expense.
OK, So What’s the Bottom Line?
The Projected Tax section of the Tax Center attempts to display for you a
running estimate of your income tax for the current year. Income and deduc-
tion categories are updated each time you make an entry or perform an
automatic update in Quicken.
The amounts you see are annual projections, not actual amounts. In other
words, if you have earned $40,000 this year and today is September 30,
Quicken projects that amount to be $53,333 for the entire year, and it’s that
larger amount that goes into the tax projection.
Projections are calculated mathematically. If you earned $40,000 in the first
nine months of the year, divide that amount by nine to come up with $4,444.44
in average earnings each month. Now multiply that result by 12 to get $53,333
estimated earnings for the entire 12 months. This is by no means an exact sci-
ence, but it is a reasonable method for estimating your tax. As you discover in
Chapter 5 of this book, the IRS approves of this method for calculating quar-
terly estimated taxes due.

Book V

OK, So What’s the Bottom Line?
365
The only amounts that appear in the Project Tax section are amounts that
come from Quicken categories that have been assigned to tax lines. Some of
your categories might not appear in this section, so there’s a chance this pro-
jection is flawed. For more on assigning tax lines, see Chapter 2 of this book.
Good news or bad news
The bottom line in the Projected Tax section either shows a Refund Due
(good news) or Remaining Tax Due (bad news). Remember, this is only an
estimate and is perhaps based on incomplete information, so don’t start 
celebrating (or selling the silver) just yet.
Dig in a little deeper if you want to see the source of this good or bad news.
Notice that every item in the Projected Tax section is hyperlinked. These
hyperlinks lead to Quicken’s Tax Planner, an area of Quicken that lets you
see the detail of how each line in the Tax Center summary is calculated.
For example, in Figure 1-2 you can see that the taxpayer has $118 in Interest/
Dividend Income. To examine the source of this amount, click on the hyper-
link for Interest/Dividend Income. The Tax Planner opens, showing the sum-
mary that appears in Figure 1-3.
Figure 1-2:

Tax area.

OK, So What’s the Bottom Line?
366
Taking a peek at the Tax Planner
In the Interest and Dividend Income display that appears when you click the
hyperlink to open the Tax Planner, you can see that this taxpayer is expected
to earn $1 in interest income and $117 in dividend income.
For more detail, click on one or the other of the amounts; for this example,
click on the dividend amount. Figure 1-4 shows that the source for the pro-
jected dividends this year comes from a dividend and capital gain distribu-
tion earned from a Fidelity investment in December of last year. That amount
was $113.90. Because the taxpayer still owns the Fidelity shares, Quicken
has assumed another dividend (slightly larger) will be paid this year and 
has added that amount to the tax estimate.
What this means is that Quicken is not just taking existing amounts you’ve
entered during the year and averaging those amounts across all the remain-
ing months. Quicken is doing some intelligent tax planning by going back to
last year and making assumptions that affect the current year.
You can read more about the Tax Planner in Chapter 5 of this book. For now,
close up the Tax Planner by clicking the X in the upper-right corner, and
return to Quicken’s Tax Center.

Tax Due Dates and Other Dates Worth Noting
Over on the right side of the Tax Center window, or right beneath the Project
Tax area, depending on the screen resolution you use, you can find the Tax
Calendar (Figure 1-5). Quicken populates the calendar with dates provided
by the IRS, such as the ever-popular April 15th, estimated tax due dates, due
dates for tax return extension forms, and due dates for extended tax returns.
But what if you want to set up alerts for other dates? The Tax Calendar has
particular dates that it is geared to warn you about. For other dates, you need
to set up reminders that appear on your main alerts list and in Billminder. You

✦State tax due dates: Some states have due dates for income tax returns,
extensions, and estimated payments that are different from the federal
due dates. 
✦Non-quarterly estimated payments: Maybe you pay your estimated pay-
ments monthly instead of quarterly. The IRS doesn’t specifically provide
monthly estimated tax forms, but you can use the quarterly forms for
payments of any frequency. For a lot of people, it’s really much easier to
budget if you just make a monthly payment.
✦Tax installment payments: If you’re on an installment plan with the tax
authorities, you certainly don’t want to forget to make the installment
payments.
Alert! Alert! Incoming Tax Payments!
Other items that appear in the Tax Calendar are alerts that relate to taxes.
Click the Set Up Alerts button beneath the Tax Calendar, and then click
Taxes to set any of the following alerts. Just check the box to turn on any of
the alerts (see Figure 1-6), or uncheck the boxes if you’re not interested.
✦Withholding threshold: Get an alert when Quicken projects that your tax
withholding is going to be either above or below the threshold you set.
For example, say you want to make sure your federal income tax with-
holding is at least $6,000 for the year and you set a threshold of $300.
Based on the withholding from your current job, you’re right on track.
But wait. Your company is cutting back on overtime and your withhold-
ing is suffering. Suddenly Quicken estimates your withholding is going to
be more like $5,500. Quicken sends you an alert letting you know that
the withholding is down. Now, chances are, your income is down too, so
the new, lower withholding amount might be just right. But it doesn’t
hurt to do a quick tax calculation and make sure you are having enough
money withheld to cover your taxes.
The withholding threshold works in reverse as well. Say you received 
a bonus along with some extra withholding, throwing your projected
withholding up to about $6,500. Quicken notifies you of this excess with-
holding with an alert. Again, because your income is up, the additional
withholding might be right on target, but you should check out your tax
computation and make sure you’re covered.

Book V
Chapter 1
The Quicken
Tax Center
Alert! Alert! Incoming Tax Payments!

You can change the withholding threshold whenever you need to by
going back into the Alerts Center and entering a new amount.
Important: If it looks like your withholding is not corresponding with
your estimated tax, you can fill out a new W-4 form and have your
employer adjust your withholding. Find out more about Form W-4 in
Book I, Chapter 1. You can also simply wait until next April 15th and
hope that the IRS doesn’t notice that your withholding is nowhere 
near the amount of tax you owe and send you scare-tactic letters with
invoices for penalties and threats of dismemberment. Or you can look
into changing that W-4.
✦Personal deduction alert: Quicken promises to provide you with “insight-
ful information” about personal deductions you might be able to claim.
The program is a little cagey (translated as — provides no explanation
whatsoever) about what qualifies as a personal deduction type of tax
alert, but hey, it can’t hurt to turn this on and see if you get a useful hint
every now and then. I have the personal deduction alerts turned on in my
Quicken program, and I see I have a reminder on my tax alerts list remind-
ing me to think about signing up for a Keogh plan before December 31.
A Keogh plan is a tax-deferred retirement plan for self-employed people.
The plans have suffered a loss of popularity in recent years due to the
influx of easier-to-establish plans like SIMPLE plans, SEP-IRAs, and the
new kid on the block, the individual 401(k).

✦Important tax dates: This is the option that adds the tax filing dates to
your tax calendar. Interestingly, I unchecked this option, but the impor-
tant tax dates stayed right where they were in my tax calendar. Once
again, it can’t hurt to turn on this feature.
For each alert, there is an option at the bottom to have the alert appear as a
text entry on the regular alert list, or as an urgent message in a pop-up box.
Tax alerts are only available in Quicken Deluxe, Premier, and Premier Home
& Business.
Tax Tools You Can Use
In addition to the lists that appear in the Tax Center, you see, along the right
side of the screen, plenty of tools for those of you who just can’t get enough
of their taxes.
In the Tools box (Figure 1-7) are quick links to Quicken’s four tax tools.
These four features help you estimate your taxes and plan for your upcom-
ing tax return as well as prepare your Quicken information for use in tax
reports and in the TurboTax tax preparation software.
✦Tax Planner: We’ve peeked at the Tax Planner already in this chapter, and
in Chapter 5 of this book, you get a heavier dose of this tool. Basically, the
Tax Planner helps you zero in on a tax projection for the year. You can
experiment with different scenarios and different filing statuses to try to
ensure you pay the least amount of tax possible.
✦Capital Gains Estimator: Use this tool to determine how a sale of an
investment will affect your tax before you actually make the sale. Quicken
helps you take advantage of the special tax rules for capital gains to maxi-
mize your income and minimize your tax. The Capital Gains Estimator
helps you choose the best time to make the sale and reminds you of ways
you can reduce tax by offsetting gains with losses. Also, the Estimator
helps you determine how much of a stock or mutual fund investment you
need to sell in order to have enough cash to pay the tax on the sale.
Figure 1-7:

In the Capital Gains Estimator, you are asked to identify your anticipated
rate of federal and state income tax, then Quicken displays your invest-
ment holdings. You select the investments you are considering selling,
and the estimator shows you the tax impact of those sales as well as the
net amount of cash you can expect to receive.
✦Tax Withholding Estimator: This estimator helps you determine how
much withholding you need to have in order to meet your tax obligation.
The Welcome window appears with a basic summary of your tax projec-
tions for the year. Click one of the worksheet options shown on the left
side of the window if you need to add or correct information.
For example, in Figure 1-8, the Adjust Basic Information worksheet has
been selected. Here you can change the filing status, the number of
dependents, or you can make adjustments to the projected income 
and itemized deductions. Each of your changes is entered in the Tax
Projection Data at the right side of the window.
Use the Experiment with W-4 Allowances worksheet to plug in different
W-4 allowances and see what effect they have on your withholding. That
way, you can easily tell if you need to revise your W-4 form with your
employer.
✦Tax Line Item Assignment: We’re going to assign tax lines in Chapter 2,
so be patient for just another couple of pages and you can read all about
this tool.

Quicken’s rotating (and redundant) tips
Look for a little box in the Tax Center, beneath the tools, called Quicken Tips.
Every time you open the Tax Center window, the information in this box
changes. You’ll see a brief description accompanying a hyperlink to the 
particular tool that Quicken wants to tell you about. Sometimes the tips are
tax-related, but sometimes they aren’t. For example, in Figure 1-9, you are
reminded to assign categories to your transactions.
These tips are a bit redundant — often they direct you to a tool or link that
appears elsewhere on the Tax Center screen.
TurboTax links
We are in the Tax Center, after all, and Intuit, the maker of Quicken, does
make TurboTax too. So it stands to reason that sooner or later you were
going to get a sales pitch for TurboTax.
Over on the right side near the bottom of the Tax Center is a Use TurboTax
box (Figure 1-10). In this box, you find a link to Help menu information about
exporting Quicken data into your TurboTax program, the Import Last Year’s
TurboTax Data hyperlink to bring information from TurboTax into Quicken; a
link to TurboTax’s online tax preparation center, where you can prepare and
file your return online; and another link to the same tax preparation center,
where you can also purchase a copy of TurboTax for your personal computer.
Tax tools that live beyond the walls of Quicken
The final box, down in the lower-right corner of the Tax Center screen, is the
Online Tax Tools box, shown in Figure 1-11. These tools ostensibly send you
to places outside of Quicken where you can find additional help about your
taxes. Actually, they take you over to some of Intuit’s Web sites.

The Tax Calculators hyperlink takes you right to the TurboTax Web site.
Once there, if you click the Tax Tips & Resources tab and do some digging,
you can find some tax calculators that help you estimate how much money
your home mortgage is saving you, whether you’re taking all the deductions
to which you’re entitled, and a tax estimator that helps you estimate how
much tax you should expect to owe, or how much of a refund you will
receive. The tax estimator is especially nice because it includes the dreaded
Alternative Minimum Tax, originally a tax on the rich that is now creeping
into mainstream America.

 Assigning tax lines
 Figuring out what is relevant to your taxes
 Looking for mistakes in your tax category assignments
 Changing tax categories
T
ax lines are the cords that connect your Quicken categories with the tax
reports you can produce in Quicken and the tax returns you prepare or
have prepared for you.
In the last chapter, we discussed the Quicken Tax Center and all of the
resources that appear there for you. Many of those resources are made
much more functional when you take the time to assign tax lines to your
Quicken categories.
In this chapter, we see how to assign tax lines to your Quicken categories.
You find out how to determine which categories receive tax lines and which
categories don’t need tax lines because they don’t affect your taxes. 
What’s a Tax Line?
A tax line is an attribute that you assign to your categories, linking them to
particular lines on the federal income tax return. Then when you produce a
tax report, you can see, line-for-line, where the totals for the year belong on
your tax return. The tax lines in Quicken actually correspond directly with
the IRS tax forms. To see what I mean, take a look at the 1040 U.S. Individual
Income Tax Return forms reproduced in this chapter.
When to assign tax lines
You can assign tax lines when you first establish a category, or later.
Remember the categories that came with your program, that were provided
by Quicken? Some of these categories came with tax line assignments;
others did not. Take the time to examine your existing list of categories
to see which ones are assigned.

What’s a Tax Line?
376
Here’s the best approach: Set aside some time to go through the entire cate-
gory list, assigning tax lines where necessary, remembering that all categories
do not need line assignments (see “Determining Which Categories Don’t Need
Tax Lines” later in this chapter).
How to assign tax lines
You can assign tax lines to your categories in a couple of different ways. You
can edit the categories, one-by-one, adding tax lines where they’re necessary.
Or you can view the entire category list, including the tax line assignments,
and add your additional tax line assignments right on that list.
In the next two sections, I discuss the two methods — pick the one you like
best.
Here’s how to assign tax lines one category at a time:
1. Open the category list (Ctrl+C or Shift+Ctrl+C) and make sure tax
information is showing by checking the Display Tax Information box
at the top of the list.
2. Scroll to a category that needs a tax line assignment and click once on
that category.
For this example, I’ve chosen Home Insurance. Because I have a home
office, some of my home insurance qualifies for a tax deduction.
3. Click the Edit button.
The Edit Category window appears (Figure 2-1). You can make any
entries or changes to the information for this category while this
window is open. For this example, we’re just going to add a tax line.
Figure 2-1:

line to your

Information
What’s a Tax Line?
377
4. Click the Tax Line Item drop-down list and scroll to the appropriate
tax line.
For this example, I’ve chosen Form 8829: Insurance. Form 8829 is the
Home Office Deduction form.
5. Click OK.
Your tax line has been assigned.
You can also assign tax lines when you create a category on-the-fly. For exam-
ple, if you’re making an entry in a register and need to create a new category,
the tax line assignment option appears in the Set Up Category window.
The Category List is sorted by category, not by tax categories. There are
many categories on the list that do not have, nor do they need, tax line
assignments. You can display a category list of just categories that have tax
line assignments. In the Show drop-down list at the top of the category list,
choose Tax-Related Categories, and your list is displayed with only the tax-
related categories.
Here’s how to assign tax to several categories at once:
1. Open the Category List by pressing Ctrl+C (or Shift+Ctrl+C).
2. Scroll to the first category that requires a tax line and click on that
category.
3. Make sure the Display Tax Information box at the top of the window is
checked.
4. On the right side of the screen is an area labeled Tax Line Item
Assignments (see Figure 2-2). Scroll down the Tax Item list until you
find the appropriate tax item, and then click on that item.
For this example, I’ve selected Property Tax as my category, and
Schedule A: Real Estate Taxes as the tax line. When you click on the tax
line, the tax box is checked for the selected category, and the tax line
assignment is entered on the category list.
5. Click on the next category that you want to assign, and repeat step 4.
Continue with as many categories as you need to assign.
Quicken has an annoying habit of returning you to the top of the category
list after each tax line assignment. It drives me buggy, having to scroll
down the list again every time I want to make a tax line assignment. For
this reason alone, I actually prefer Method 1 for assigning tax lines.

Tax Form Cross-Reference Key
378
Don’t worry if you make a mistake on the tax line assignment — you
can always fix it later (see “Changing Your Tax Lines” later in this
chapter).
Tax Form Cross-Reference Key
In order to assign tax lines, you need a basic understanding of what types of
income and expenses go on the lines of your tax return. If you’ve never pre-
pared your own income tax return, this might seem extraordinarily foreign to
you. Maybe you plan on continuing having someone else prepare your tax
return, but with the information presented here, you can prepare your infor-
mation for that person (or for yourself) so that your tax return preparation
goes smoothly. Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 illustrate the 1040 and Schedule A
tax forms, two forms you may be familiar with.
The best way to determine on what tax return lines your income and expenses
should appear is to use last year’s income tax return as a reference.

Determining Which Categories Don’t Need Tax Lines
Some Quicken categories relate to your income tax return, but you don’t
want to assign tax lines to them. These are categories where the amounts
don’t carry dollar for dollar onto the main 1040 tax form, or where there is
not a clear method of determining on which tax form line the amount should
appear. Here are some examples of categories that might be better off left
unassigned, even though ultimately the amount in the category is going to
find its way onto your tax return:

Book V
Chapter 2
Entering 
Tax-Friendly
Information
Determining Which Categories Don’t Need Tax Lines
385
✦Home mortgage expense: If you don’t distinguish in your Quicken regis-
ter between home mortgage principal and interest, you don’t want to
assign a tax line to the home mortgage expense, because only the inter-
est represents a tax deduction.
✦Home mortgage interest and real estate tax: If you own your home and
run a business from your home, a portion of your home mortgage interest
and your real estate tax count as business expense for your home office;
the rest counts as itemized deductions.
✦Itemized deductions in general: There’s no point in taking the time to
identify tax lines for itemized deductions that you can’t deduct on your
tax return. For example, if you don’t qualify to take the medical deduc-
tion (medical expenses have to exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted
gross income before you can take the deduction), why bother assigning
tax lines to these expenses? Likewise, if you don’t have enough itemized
deductions overall to itemize on your tax return, you don’t need to
assign tax categories to any of the deductible items.
✦Education: Here’s a tricky one. You can reduce your taxes with education
expenses in several ways. You might qualify for the Hope Scholarship
Credit, or the Lifetime Learning Credit. Maybe your education expenses
belong with your itemized deductions as business-related expenses. Or
perhaps your best tax advantage comes from claiming the education
expenses on page one of your tax return as part of the tuition and fees
deduction.
✦Income from a hobby: If you have a hobby that has started producing
income, you might have to include Schedule C with your tax return, the
form where business income is reported. The income and expenses from
the activity are all reported on Schedule C.
Sometimes hobby income and expenses get reported on Schedule C as
described above. Sometimes the hobby income is reported on page one
of your tax return as Other Income and the related expenses are
required to be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions and
reported on Schedule A. Sometimes no deduction is allowed at all for
your hobby expenses. Contact your tax advisor if you have questions
about how to report income and expenses from your hobby.
✦State income tax refunds: These are taxable, but only to the extent that
you got some benefit from deducting the state income tax on the previ-
ous year’s federal income tax return. So the refund might or might not
be taxable.
✦Sales tax: Sales tax is a deduction on your Schedule A, but only as an
alternative to deducting state and local income tax. You’re supposed to
figure out which one gives you the better deduction, sales tax or state
and local income tax, and then deduct just one or the other.

Determining Which Categories Don’t Need Tax Lines
386
✦Cost of gambling: These costs, including buying lottery tickets, playing
games of chance, betting on horses, or any other type of gambling, is
deductible as an itemized deduction, but only to the extent of the amount
of gambling winnings you report as income. So until you get to the end of
the year and find out how much you’ve won for the entire year, you don’t
know how much, if any, of your gambling costs are deductible.
✦IRA contributions: These can be deductible, or not, depending on how
much income you earn, whether you or your spouse are covered by pen-
sion plans at work, or even just depending on whether you choose to
take the deduction.
When making tax line assignments, you can choose the alternative of check-
ing off the Tax check box for a category without assigning a specific tax line.
That way, the category gets included in the Tax Summary report and is
available for analysis when preparing your income tax return (see Chapter 3
in this book for more information on the Tax Summary report). This is
especially useful for the situations described above, where transactions
belong on your tax return, but it’s not clear exactly what tax line they’ll
go on or exactly what amount of the transaction is going to qualify for a
deduction.
Income limitations affect the tax treatment of many expenses, including
various education expenses, childcare expenses, and even your itemized
deductions as a whole. As you can see, it’s very difficult to identify which
expenses are going to generate income tax deductions for you.
Hunting for mistakes: Searching
through your tax line assignments
You might find it helpful to examine tax reports
(see next chapter) and look at the details to see
what kind of transactions are showing up in
each tax line. You might have miscoded cate-
gories to the wrong tax line, or some tax line
assignments might be correct but the transac-
tion was coded to the wrong category. A careful
analysis of the transactions being directed to
each tax line can ensure accuracy when you get
ready to prepare your income tax return.
It’s very important to make sure you get your
tax line assignments right. The IRS doesn’t like
mistakes.

387
Changing Your Tax Lines
If you’ve assigned tax lines to your tax categories, and then decide you
made a mistake and want to make a change, you’ll find that it’s an easy task
to switch from one tax line assignment to another, or to remove a tax line
assignment altogether.
Removing tax lines
Just follow these steps to remove the tax line assigned to a particular
category:
1. Open the category list by pressing Ctrl+C (or Shift+Ctrl+C).
2. Click on the category whose tax line assignment you want to change.
For this example, I’ve selected IRA Contrib. I’ve decided I no longer want
to make tax deductible contributions to my IRA. Future contributions
will not be deducted on my income tax return, so I want to change the
tax line assignment for this category.
3. Uncheck the box in the Tax column next to the IRA category (see
Figure 2-5).
Figure 2-5:
Uncheck
the little 
tax box to

A window appears, asking if you’re sure you want to remove the tax line
assigned to this category (Figure 2-6).
4. Click Yes to remove the tax line assignment.
Picking a new tax line
Say that instead of removing a tax line, you want to change an existing tax line
to something different. For this example, I’m changing my hobby into a real
business that I plan to report on Schedule C of my tax return. I need to change
the tax line on my Subscriptions category from Schedule A: Subscriptions to
Schedule C: Other Business Expenses. Here’s how to make the change:
1. Open the category list (Ctrl+C or Shift+Ctrl+C)).
2. Click on the category that you want to change (in this case,
Subscriptions).
3. Click the Edit button.
The Edit Category window appears (Figure 2-7).

4. Make the appropriate change in the Tax Line Item drop-down list.
5. Click the OK button.
The Edit Category window closes, and your tax line assignment has been
changed. You can view and verify the change in the category list.
When you make a category change, from that point forward, all reports
showing that category are coded to the new tax line. Even reports from 
a previous year, when the category was coded as a different tax line,
now show the new tax assignment. If you’re concerned that this change
might alter previous tax records that you might need to show to the IRS
some day, you might want to print out hard copies of your old tax
reports before you start changing tax categories.
Working with an Accountant or Tax Professional
You might be a do-it-yourself kind of person who really enjoys putting
together your income tax returns. And that’s great. Or maybe you’re the 
type of person who prefers to hire a pro to make sure you’ve got it right.
You can hire a tax preparer, or you can hire a tax helper. A preparer is going
to use your tax reports and put together your entire tax return. Alternatively,
you can prepare your tax return yourself, but consider hiring an experienced
tax preparer to at least look over your tax return and make suggestions.
Several types of professional tax preparers are out there. Here’s a quick look
at the credentials you may see mentioned when you start leafing through the
yellow pages.
✦CPAs: A Certified Public Accountant is someone who has been educated
as an accountant, who has passed a rigorous test and who has worked
for awhile in the accounting profession. CPAs maintain their licenses by
attending relevant continuing education courses each year. Be aware of
the fact that just because someone is a CPA, that person might not be a
tax professional. Make sure you find out a little about the background
and the area of specialization of the person you’re considering hiring
before you commit to the relationship.
✦PAs and accountants: The difference between a public accountant and a
CPA is that the public accountant has never passed the CPA exam, or
has passed the exam but hasn’t worked long enough in the profession to
receive the CPA license. Or, a PA can be a CPA who has chosen not to
maintain the CPA license. PAs are licensed accountants and they attend
continuing education classes each year, just like the CPAs, in order to
maintain their licenses. An accountant is anyone who claims to be one,

but usually only persons educated in the area of accounting attempt to
make this claim. Fees for PAs and accountants are usually less than
those that CPAs charge.
✦Enrolled Agents (EAs): An EA is a tax preparer who has passed an exam-
ination administered by the IRS and who has received a license from the
IRS to prepare tax returns.
✦Tax preparers: Be aware of the fact that anyone can call himself or herself
a tax preparer. Just because a person calls himself a lion trainer doesn’t
mean the lion isn’t going to have him for dinner if he flinches at the wrong
time. There is no training necessary for someone to use the designation
Tax Preparer, so be careful when choosing someone with no credentials.

efore you actually have to prepare a tax return, you can cozy up to
Quicken’s tax reports, analyze your spending and income, make sure
everything you’ve coded for tax lines is in the right place, and make sure
any transactions you haven’t coded for tax lines get coded properly. And
how are going to do all this? Just let me show you how!
The Tax Summary Report: Your Starting Point
for Tax Return Preparation
The Tax Summary report is the first place I look when I’m getting ready to
assemble information for my income tax return. I enjoy examining the Tax
Summary report because I’m a tax nerd and these numbers all make sense to
me. I also enjoy examining the Tax Summary report because it’s easy to spot
any errors in my tax line assignments when I look at this report. Transactions
that don’t belong in certain tax-related categories stick out like the proverbial
sore thumb when you see them on the Tax Summary report.
The Tax Summary report is a nit-picker’s dream. The report displays all of
the tax categories that are tagged for inclusion in your tax records, subto-
taled by category, and with the complete detail of every transaction that has
been posted in those categories for the selected time period.
One feature of the Tax Summary report that I particularly like is that all of
your categories that have been marked as being tax-related appear on this
report, even if the categories have not been assigned to a tax line.
You can designate a category as being tax-related without assigning the cat-
egory to a specific tax line. Just check the Tax check box when editing infor-
mation about the category, as described in Chapter 2 of this book.

The Tax Summary Report: Your Starting Point for Tax Return Preparation

Working with the Tax Summary report
You can view the Tax Summary report, as displayed in Figure 3-1, by clicking
on the Reports➪Tax➪Tax Summary. The first time you view the report, you
might want to customize the report in certain ways so that the data you see
is useful to you:
✦Set the Date Range to reflect the current year, current quarter, or what-
ever time period is best suited to your needs.
✦Remove unwanted columns: For example, you might not need to see
the check numbers, account names, or account clearance (Clr) columns.
Remove a column from view by clicking on the double bar to the right of
the unwanted column heading, and then dragging the bar over to the left
until it overlaps the bar for the previous column. When you release your
mouse button, the column disappears.
✦Resize remaining columns: Because you have more room after removing
columns, you can expand remaining columns by dragging the double bar
on the right side of a column header over to the right. Make a column
smaller by dragging the double bar over to the left (but not all the way
over to the next column, unless you want this column to disappear too!).
✦Bring back lost columns: Did you remove a column by accident? Click
Customize in the top-right corner. On the opening customization screen
is a box labeled Show Columns. Select the little check boxes for each
column you want to display.
✦Save your revised report: Click the Save Report button on the Report
toolbar to give a unique name to this report and make it available for
future viewing, without having to re-create the entire report. Call the
report “My Tax Summary Report,” or “Info I Need for My Tax Return,” or
whatever name seems most appropriate to you.
Turn your Tax Summary into a Tax Schedule report instantly by changing the
Subtotal By option to Tax Schedule.
When you examine the information that appears in your Tax Summary
report, look for transactions that seem misplaced — items that got coded to
the wrong tax category, or transactions that don’t seem to fit with the other
transactions in a group.
If you need to change the category on a transaction so that it fits into a dif-
ferent tax group, double-click on the transaction as it appears in the Tax
Summary report. The actual transaction appears. You can change the cate-
gory if necessary, and then click Enter to record the transaction. Return to
the Tax Summary report by clicking the Tax Summary Report button at the
bottom of the register.

Using the Tax Schedule report
The Tax Schedule report, also found on the Reports menu and then on the
Tax side menu, is a report you’ll need when preparing your income tax
return. This report (see Figure 3-2) is organized by tax schedule, and then 
by tax line within each tax schedule. Only categories to which you assigned
tax lines appear on this report.
Like its Tax Summary report buddy, the Tax Schedule report provides the
complete detail for all transactions in each category that appears on the
report. You can examine the report to make sure the information in each 
tax line is coded correctly.
Although Quicken’s customization features enable you to change the appear-
ance of the reports to fit specific needs, you might find that you can save
time if you’re interested in using the specialized tax reports that are new to
the 2006 version of Quicken.
Quicken’s tax reports can only display information that you’ve entered
in Quicken. To make sure your tax reports are thorough and provide all the
information you need for the preparation of your income tax return, you must
enter all of your financial transactions for the entire year in your Quicken pro-
gram and assign tax lines where necessary to your categories.

When to use the tax reports
Some important steps are necessary for the preparation of your income tax
returns (beyond getting your hair done so you’ll look nice for the tax pre-
parer, renting a condo in the Cayman Islands for that quick escape when the
tax examiner calls . . .). Examining the information on your tax reports to
make sure everything has been accounted for correctly can help you com-
plete many of those steps.
Here are some tips for when and how to use the Quicken tax reports:
✦Do a preliminary analysis. Before you start preparing your tax return or
before you get ready to meet with your tax advisor, examine the Tax
Summary report carefully. Look at the detail that appears in each sec-
tion of the report and make sure that those transactions appear in the
correct section. Double-click on any transaction that needs to be
revised, and you are taken to the original transaction, where you can
correct the category if necessary.
✦Compare your Tax Summary report to the Tax Schedule report to make
sure that all amounts that need to go on your tax return are properly
coded with the correct tax line. (If you’re not sure of which tax lines you
need to use on your tax return, your tax professional can help you with
this.)

Quicken’s new specialized tax reports
These reports give you additional insight into
the information required for preparation of your
income tax return, and enable you to isolate
and examine the information for specific areas
of your tax return. Find them by choosing Tax on
the Reports menu.
 Schedule A: Itemized Deductions: Only the
categories that have been assigned to tax
lines for itemized deductions appear on this
report. This includes medical expenses,
deductible interest and taxes, charitable
contributions, casualty losses, and miscel-
laneous deductions such as job costs, 
tax preparer fees, gambling losses, and
investment-related expenses (see the fol-
lowing figure).
 Schedule B: Interest and Dividend Income:
Schedule B categories include interest
income and dividend income.
 Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses: The
categories included on this report are
short-term and long-term gains and losses
from sales of investments.

Analyzing Your Income
396
Analyzing Your Income
When you think of income and your taxes, you need to think beyond the
obvious income you earn at your job. The IRS expects you to report several
types of income on your income tax return. If you track all of your income in
Quicken, you have ready access to the information you need for your tax
return.
For some reason, most people use Quicken to track their job income and
their expenses, but they don’t always get around to including all of their
income in Quicken. Income can arrive in the form of interest on your savings
accounts, dividends on investments, and other miscellaneous payments you
receive during the year.
Many of the people or companies that pay you income during the year send
you little reminders in January in the form of information returns, or 1099
forms. The sidebar entitled, “Annual information returns you might receive,”
explains the most common 1099 forms and what they mean.
Whether you receive a 1099 form or not, or whether you track all your
income in Quicken or not, it is still your responsibility to record all of
your income on your income tax return.
The 1040 is the standard federal income tax return. Depending on how many
different types of income and deductions you have to report and how much
money you earn, you might be able to use a Form 1040A or a Form 1040EZ,
simpler forms of the Form 1040.
Payers of dividends and interest are not required to provide you with 1099
forms if your earnings for the year are less than $10. Payers of miscellaneous
income reported on a 1099-MISC don’t have to give you a form unless your
income is at least $600. This does not free you from the obligation to
report such income on your tax return. It’s up to you to keep track of
your earnings and report the amount you earned even if you don’t receive
a 1099 form.
Agreeing your income to your information return
As I detailed in the sidebar titled, “Annual information returns you might
receive,” you might receive any of several types of information returns after
the first of each year. One of the most common mistakes people make on
their income tax returns is assuming the amounts on these information
returns are accurate and reporting those amounts as income on their
tax returns.

Book V
Chapter 3

Analyzing Your Income
397
So what should you do if you compare your information return income with
the actual income you receive during the year and you think the amount on
your 1099 form is incorrect? Here are some points to keep in mind when
dealing with the discrepancies:
Annual information returns you might receive
Every January, you can count on receiving
forms in the mail that tell you how much money
you earned in the previous year. You are
expected to account for the amounts on these
forms on your tax return (see the following
figure). Here’s a sample of the most common
income-reporting forms:
 W-2: Every employer you worked for sends
you a W-2 form showing how much money
you earned, how much tax was withheld,
and how much money you contributed to
an employer-sponsored retirement fund.
This form might also include information
about amounts you contributed to health
insurance, union dues, flex plan, and other
company-sponsored funds.
 1099-DIV: You should receive a 1099-DIV
from any company that paid you dividends
on stock you owned, any mutual fund in
which you own shares, and any credit
union of which you are a member. These
forms come in many different styles and
sizes, and often, especially in the case of
the mutual funds and credit unions, the
1099-DIV information is incorporated into
the monthly statement for December.
 1099-INT: If you have money tied up in a
savings account, certificate of deposit, or
bond and you receive interest related to
these investments, you should receive a
1099-INT form after the end of the year.
 1099-MISC: Money you receive for services
you provide is supposed to be reported to
you on a 1099-MISC form. For example, if
you’re a wage-earner by day and a free-
lance personal trainer for a gym by night,
the gym should give you a 1099-MISC show-
ing your share of the fees for your training
services. (Note: Typically, individuals don’t
prepare 1099 forms, so if you hire yourself
out to give private personal training ses-
sions, you probably won’t receive any 1099-
MISC forms from your customers —
however, you of course must still report the
income on your tax return.)

Analyzing Your Income
398
✦If you’re a shareholder in a company that declares dividends in late
December but mails the dividend checks so that they aren’t received
until January, you don’t have to report the dividend income until the
year in which you receive the income. Your 1099-DIV form is going to
include the amount of the December dividend. You have the right to
match the dividend income to the year in which the income is actually
received and pay tax on the income in the proper year.
✦The same goes for miscellaneous income if a company authorizes a pay-
ment to you in December, reports that payment on your 1099-MISC, but
you don’t actually receive the payment until January. You can report the
income on your tax return for the year in which you actually receive
the income.
Delaying the cashing or depositing of a check does not delay the year in
which the income is taxable. If you receive some payments in the last
week of December and decide not to deposit the checks until January, or
if you’re out of town the last week of December and don’t get your mail
until January, you still are required to report the income on the tax
return for the year in which it was received.
If the amount reported on your 1099 form is not the same amount you
received during the tax year, you should report the actual amount you
received on your tax return. The IRS receives copies of the same 1099
forms that you receive, so it is helpful, when making such a change, to
attach a statement to your tax return explaining the discrepancy between
the 1099 form and the amount you report. Here’s a sample statement:
Name: Barney Rubble
Social Security number: 222-333-4444
I received a 1099-DIV from XYZ Corporation reporting $200.00 in divi-
dend income for the year 2006. I actually received $150 in dividend
income from XYZ Corporation in 2006. The remaining $50 dividend
was declared payable in December 2006 but not received by me until
January 10th, 2007.
Therefore I am reporting $150 in dividend income from XYZ Corporation
on my 2006 income tax return. I will add the remaining $50 to the
dividend income reported on my 2007 form 1099-DIV and report that
on my 2007 income tax return.
If you report an amount on your tax return that is less than the amount
reported on the 1099 form due to the fact that you received the money in the
year after the year in which the money was paid, be sure to make a note to
yourself that on next year’s tax return, you are going to have to increase the
1099 amount from that payer to reflect the extra amount from the prior year.

Reporting your W-2 income
Income from the job or jobs where you worked as an employee is reported to
you on a W-2 form. You can count on receiving this form from your employer
sometime in January. If the amount on the W-2 form does not agree with your
records, you should take up the problem with your employer and not alter
the amount on your tax return. You might have to request your employer to
issue a revised W-2 form if there is an error.
The IRS expects you to report the full amount of income and tax withholding
from your W-2 form on your tax return.
Tax-deferred income
If you receive income on which tax has been deferred, such as income from
an IRA or 401(k) plan, that income is reported on a 1099-R form and you are
required to pay income tax on the income in the year in which you receive
the money.
For more information about receiving income from your retirement plans,
see Book VI, Chapter 2.
Analyzing Your Deductions
Deductions are amounts that you spend that reduce the income on which
your tax is computed. In other words, you can subtract the amount you
spend on deductible items from your income before you calculate your
income tax on your tax return.
Not all of the money you spend during the year qualifies as a deduction on
your tax return, but you might be surprised just how much of your spending
does generate a deduction.
The main categories of deductions are itemized deductions, deductions and
credits for childcare and education costs (including education for the parents
or adults in the family), and other miscellaneous deductions and adjustments.
A brief summary of these types of deductions follows, with suggestions for
how to analyze these categories when they appear on your tax reports.
Itemized deductions
These are the deductions that appear on your Schedule A. Your deductions
have to surpass the standard deduction that is allowed to all taxpayers (except

Analyzing Your Deductions
400
dependent children) before you are allowed to use these deductions to reduce
your taxable income. The standard deduction increases every year. For 2006,
when this book went to press, the standard deductions were as follows:
Married filing jointly and surviving spouse taxpayers
$10,000
Married filing separately taxpayers
$ 5,000
Head of household taxpayers
$ 7.300
Single taxpayers
$ 5,000
Itemized deductions fall into six main categories. These categories are
described below, along with pointers for analyzing your expenses that have
been coded to these categories.
Medical deductions
The medical expenses you’ve coded to tax lines in Quicken will be trans-
ferred to the Medical and Dental Expenses section of your Schedule A
(Figure 3-3). These expenses should be organized in Quicken as follows:
✦Medicine and Drugs: This category on your Tax Schedule report should
include only medicine that is prescribed by a doctor. Over-the-counter
medications, such as aspirins and cold medicine, do not qualify for a 
tax deduction. In Quicken, you need to break out prescription and non-
prescription medicine in two categories, so that the prescription medi-
cine can be assigned to the Medicine and drugs tax line. The IRS permits
you to include insulin with prescription medicine.
✦Doctors, Dentists, and Hospitals: This is really the catch-all medical tax
line in Quicken. Because Quicken only provides the four medical tax
lines described here, you need to expand the definition of the tax lines in
order to account for all medical expenses. When I code Quicken medical
categories to tax lines, I include all deductible medical expenses in this
category except items that are specifically prescription medicine or
mileage, travel, and lodging. Therefore, in my Doctors, Dentists, and
Hospitals category, you’ll find eyeglasses and contact lenses, lab fees
and x-rays, health insurance that is not paid by my employer, crutches,
oxygen, nursing services, psychiatric care, special education costs, fees
for a stop-smoking program, telephone equipment for hearing-impaired,
seeing-eye and hearing-ear dogs, the cost of close captioning equipment
on the television for the hard-of-hearing, and so on. OK, so I lied a little
bit. I don’t really have all these things going on. But if I did, this is the tax
line I’d use to categorize all of these expenses properly so they will show
up on my Quicken tax reports.
✦Medical Travel and Lodging: In this category you should include any
transportation and lodging that are expressly related to medical care.
You can include ambulance fees, or taxis taken to see the doctor or to get
to a medical facility. Include the cost of attending a medical conference.

Book V
Chapter 3
Tax Reports

Analyzing Your Deductions
401
✦Medical Mileage: You also are entitled to a deduction for mileage when
driving to medical facilities. It’s difficult to break out the medical mileage
when you pay for gas and enter your auto expenses in Quicken, so make
a note to yourself that you need to include on your tax return or provide
your tax preparer with the information about how many miles you drive
for medical care. If you specifically pay for a tank of gas that is used exclu-
sively for medical purposes, you can code that gas purchase as medical
mileage, but you still have to perform a calculation of the number of miles
you drove for medical purposes for the entire year. This particular tax line
really isn’t going to do you much good in Quicken.
Plenty of medical expenses don’t qualify for tax deductions. Here are some
examples of expenses that should be categorized in Quicken as medical
expenses, but not included in the tax line assignments described above: 
non-prescription drugs; health insurance paid at the office and deducted
from your pay before taxes are withheld; cosmetic surgery (although some
surgical procedures are deductible — check with your tax advisor); mater-
nity clothes; health club dues; teeth whitening treatments; weight loss
programs; and nutritional supplements.
Tax expenses
The IRS allows you to deduct certain types of taxes in the Taxes You Paid
section of your Schedule A (see Figure 3-4). Here are the tax-related tax lines
and what you should look for when analyzing expenses in these categories:
✦State income taxes: Because there is a separate tax line for state income
tax withheld from your wages, the amounts assigned to the State Income
Taxes tax line should only include state tax amounts other than your
withholding. Expect to see a state tax refund in this category if you
received a refund last year. And if you paid any state income taxes for a
prior year, that amount should appear here too. The state tax refund is
potential taxable income to you, and the extra amounts you paid for ear-
lier tax years represent an itemized deduction.
✦Local income taxes: The rules are the same as for state taxes. W-2
amounts get coded to the W-2 withholding tax line, so for this local tax
line, you should only see refunds or back taxes paid.
Figure 3-3:

expenses

in the top
section on
Schedule A.

Analyzing Your Deductions
402
✦State estimated tax, qtrly: This is the tax line you use when you make
payments of quarterly state and local estimated taxes. The amount you
paid during the year gets added to the state tax withheld, and any back
taxes you paid to arrive at your state income tax deduction.
✦Real estate taxes: In this tax line, you should see the tax you pay on any
real estate that you own. Real estate tax that you pay with your mort-
gage payment might need to be recoded so that it appears on this tax
line. Real estate tax on other real property investments that you own,
including the tax portion of condominium fees, should also be assigned
to this group.
✦Personal property taxes: The personal property tax line is a little tricky.
Not all states charge personal property taxes, so many people don’t have
any amount here. If you live in a state where you pay personal property
tax along with your vehicle license plate fees, you need to split out the
personal property tax portion of the fee when you enter the payment in
Quicken and make sure you assign this tax line to the category containing
the tax amount. Other types of personal property tax include property
tax on large vehicles such as recreational vehicles, trailers, and boats.
✦Other taxes: Are there any other taxes left for this tax line? Foreign tax
comes to my mind. If you have investments in companies with overseas
operations, you might have foreign tax withheld from your dividend
income. You have a choice whether you want to deduct the tax or claim
a credit for the tax. In either case, the tax should be placed in a category
that is coded as Other Taxes, and then when you prepare your tax
return, you can decide on the best way to treat the tax.
✦Sales tax paid: The IRS has reinstated the sales tax deduction (effective
with 2004 tax returns), but you can only take a deduction for either your
sales tax or your state and local income tax. The sales tax deduction was
reinstated after lobbyists from states without a state sales tax com-
plained, and the deduction was designed to benefit residents of those
states. But sometimes even if you pay state and local income tax, the sales
tax you pay is higher. You can pick which deduction you want to take, so if
Figure 3-4:
Tax
expenses

in the
second
section on
Schedule A.

Book V
Chapter 3
Tax Reports

Analyzing Your Deductions
403
you want to really take advantage of Quicken, throughout the year, split
every one of your purchase transactions so that you break out sales tax
into a separate category, and give that category a tax line of Other Taxes.
Then at the end of the year it should be a simple matter to see whether
you paid enough sales tax to make the deduction worthwhile.
Quicken reports alone aren’t enough to support your deduction for sales
tax, or, for that matter, for anything. You are responsible for saving
receipts that support your tax return deductions.
Interest expenses
You can take a deduction for certain types of interest expense on Schedule A
in the Interest You Paid section, as shown in Figure 3-5. When recording
interest payments, make sure you’ve coded all entries properly so that only
the interest appears in the tax category and not the principal portion of your
payment. For example, when you pay your mortgage or a car loan, only the
interest portion of your payment is a deductible expense.
The tax lines available for reporting interest expenses include the following:
✦Home mortgage interest (1098): The amount you pay in home mortgage
interest (including points) should agree with the amount reported on
the 1098 form you receive from your lender. However, refer back to the
section titled “Agreeing your income to your information return” earlier
in this chapter. Those rules apply to your mortgage 1098 form as well. If
the form you receive from your lender doesn’t jibe with the amount you
know you paid, record the actual amount you paid on your tax return
and attach a statement to the tax return explaining the difference.
Don’t be afraid to call attention to your tax return by attaching a state-
ment. There’s nothing wrong with calling attention to the fact that there
is an error on your information return. All you’re doing is pointing out
the fact that you keep excellent records and that you are entering the
correct amounts on your tax return.
Figure 3-5:

section on
Schedule A.

Analyzing Your Deductions
404
✦Home mortgage int, (no 1098): So you didn’t receive a 1098 form from
your lender? If you paid mortgage interest and have no 1098 to show for
it, this is the tax line you should have assigned to your mortgage interest
payments. Make sure when analyzing your tax reports that you got your
mortgage interest on the correct tax line. You do call attention to your
return when you have interest that was not reported on a 1098. The IRS
wants to know who received the interest and wants to make sure that
person is reporting the interest income properly. You will be expected to
provide the name, address, and Social Security number or federal ID
number for the person or company to whom you paid your interest.
✦Points paid (no 1098): If you didn’t receive a 1098 form that specified
how much you paid in points, but you did pay points, you should code
the points to this line. Sometimes points are a deductible expense, and
sometimes they are not. If you have an amount in this category showing
up on your tax report, be sure to call attention to this amount to your tax
preparer and determine the rules for reporting the points that you paid.
There is no tax line available for interest paid on money that was used for
investments, even though this amount can qualify for a tax deduction. Make a
note of any interest you paid on money used for investments (you can code it
to a tax-related category without giving it a specific tax line) and check the tax
rules or ask your tax professional for advice on how to handle this interest.
Charity expenses
Amounts you give to charity result in a tax deduction on Schedule A in the
Gifts to Charity section (Figure 3-6). Examine the amounts that appear in the
following categories to make sure an actual deduction is allowed.
✦Cash charity contributions: Amounts paid to charities appear on your
tax reports with this tax line assignment. But make sure that the charities
are the kinds of charities that qualify for a tax deduction. Some non-profit
groups might be good causes but they don’t count for a tax deduction.
For example, political groups and public action committees don’t qualify
for tax deductions. Contributions to individuals don’t qualify for a tax
deduction, nor do raffle tickets (even when sold by charities). The cost of
keeping a foreign student in your home is partially deductible, so include
those expenses too. Look through your list of charitable expenses and
make sure only the viable deductions are included.
✦Non-cash charity contributions: I doubt many people use this tax line
because most of the non-cash contributions that people make are in the
form of old clothes, books, and household items that were purchased
many years ago and those purchases don’t show up as current expenses
in Quicken. But if you purchased something during the year that was
donated to a charity, such as food that you gave to the food bank, baking

supplies for the brownies you made for the school bake sale, or other
items that you purchased and immediately donated, those amounts
should appear in this tax group.
✦Charity mileage: Here’s a tax line that seems unnecessary. Much like the
tax line for medical mileage, unless you have specific automobile costs
that you can attribute exclusively to charity, you probably won’t use this
tax line. The charity mileage deduction is based on the actually number
of miles you drove for charitable purposes during the entire year.
Miscellaneous expenses
There is a handful of other types of expenses that should appear on your tax
return and thus should be assigned to particular tax lines. These expenses
are included as Job Expenses and Most Other Miscellaneous Deductions on
your Schedule A (see Figure 3-7). Here are the remaining tax lines with a
description of what you should see and what you should look for when these
tax lines appear on your tax reports.
✦Tax preparation fees: If you pay someone to prepare your taxes, that
cost should be categorized as a tax preparation fee and should appear
on your tax reports. Included in the category of tax preparation fees is
the cost of tax preparation software, books you bought to help you
understand taxes, and the cost of filing your tax return electronically.
✦Investment management fees: Costs of getting investment advice and
maintaining your investments (including the cost of Quicken if maintain-
ing investment information is its primary use), and fees paid to brokers
qualify as tax-deductible expenses.
✦Subscriptions: Before you get excited about taking a deduction for your
subscription to your favorite recipe magazine, note that the only sub-
scriptions that are tax deductible are subscriptions to publications that
help you earn or maintain your income. Investment publications qualify,
as do publications relating to your profession. Beyond that, you’re going
to have a tough time proving your personal fun reading qualifies for a
tax deduction.

tributions

406
✦Misc., subject to 2 percent AGI limit: Plenty of other expenses count as
miscellaneous deductions. If you have any of these expenses and they
don’t show up on your tax reports, you should go back through your
register, try to find which categories these expenses have been assigned
to, and give those categories the proper tax lines. Isolated occurrences
of these expenses can be listed on your tax return Schedule A and coded
to the Schedule A tax lines. If you have several of these expenses, or if
they are ongoing throughout the year, use the Form 2106 as described in
“Other job expenses” below and code your expenses to those tax lines.
Here are the types of expenses you should be looking for on the
Miscellaneous deductions line of your tax reports:
• Job search expense: You don’t have to be out of work to take a 
tax deduction for the cost of looking for a new job. Included in this
description are printing, postage, cost of traveling to interviews, 
and resume service.
You can only take a deduction for job search expenses if you already
have or have had a job in the same profession. If you’re looking for
your first job, if you’ve been out of the workforce for an extended
period of time, or if you’re making a career change, you’re on your
own — no help from the IRS with your expenses.
• Education: If you are employed and take classes that maintain your
skill in your profession or improve your skills within the same profes-
sion, or if the classes are required by your employer, you have an
option of taking a deduction for the cost of those classes. But see the
section later in this chapter called “Tax deductions and credits relating
to children and education.” You might qualify for a tax credit for your
tuition costs, and that can be more lucrative than the miscellaneous
deduction. If you do decide to claim your expenses as a miscellaneous
itemized deduction, you can deduct the tuition, books, fees associated
with your class, and travel expenses to and from the classes.

• Uniforms: If you purchase clothing or shoes exclusively for work and
those items cannot be mistaken for clothes you would wear outside
of work, the cost of purchasing and caring for the items is a tax-
deductible expense. Care of the uniform includes dry cleaning and
laundering and repairs. If you wear a business suit to work and only
to work, that doesn’t qualify as a uniform because you could wear the
suit outside of work without the suit being mistaken for a uniform.
• Tools: The cost of tools purchased for use at your job qualifies as a
deductible expense. The items that qualify as tools vary from job to
job. Be sure you can justify the need for your tools as being neces-
sary to the accomplishment of your job.
It is presumed that you have not received a reimbursement from
your employer for any of these tax-deductible items that you pur-
chase. If you are reimbursed, there is no deduction allowed.
• Other job expenses: Some people have lots of job-related expenses,
including travel and meals, equipment they have to purchase, home
office expenses, and more. Those expenses get summarized on
Form 2106 and there are a dozen related tax lines for reporting
employee business expenses (see Figure 3-8). Partially reimbursed
expenses can be reported on Form 2106 as well, and then your
deduction is reduced by the amount of your reimbursement.

Most of the deductions that fall in the miscellaneous categories are subject
to a pesky little rule that states that only the amount of the expenses that
surpasses 2 percent of your adjusted gross income can be included with
your itemized deductions.
• Gambling losses: You are allowed to take a deduction for gambling
losses, but only to the extent of any gambling winnings that you
report in income. When examining transactions that appear on this
tax line, make sure you have included the cost of lottery tickets,
raffle tickets, slot machines, and any betting that you did during the
year. You should also have a place in Quicken where you record gam-
bling winnings, and those amounts should be coded with a tax line of
Other Income, Misc..
• No 2 percent AGI limit: The most common expense that should
appear in this tax line on your tax reports is the cost you incurred
that relates to casualties such as storm damage repair. Be aware,
however, that the deduction calculation for casualty losses can get
complicated, and you should consider consulting with a tax profes-
sional if you have expenses of this nature.
Tax deductions versus tax credits
Tax deductions and tax credits are two different
species, both designed to reduce your income
tax but in different ways. You’ll find that when
given a choice, the tax credit is usually more
attractive than the tax deduction (although there
are exceptions to this rule).
Tax deductions reduce the amount of income
on which your tax is calculated. For example, if
your total income is $40,000 and you have
$5,000 in tax deductions, you get to subtract the
deductions from your income and calculate
your tax on $35,000 instead of $40,000. If the tax
rate you pay is 15 percent, your tax on $40,000
would have been $6,000 ($40,000 x 15 percent).
When you cut your income to $35,000, your tax
goes down to $5,250 ($35,000 x 15 percent). In
effect, you cut your tax by 15 percent of your
deductions or $750 ($5,000 x 15 percent).
Another way to look at this is that for every
dollar of tax deduction you can come up with,
you save 15¢ on your taxes.
Sounds good, right? But get a load of this:
Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you
pay, dollar for dollar. So if you have $40,000 in
income and you pay tax at a rate of 15 percent,
you start with owing $6,000. But if you have $5,000
in tax credits, you reduce the actual tax by
$5,000 instead of reducing the income by $5,000,
so your tax goes from $6,000 to $1,000. Cool, huh?!
The catch is that some tax credits aren’t avail-
able to you if your income is too high (or too low),
and in some situations, you could take a deduc-
tion for the full cost of something but you only
can take a credit for a percentage of the cost, so
it might work out the same or even better if you
take the deduction instead of the credit.
The bottom line is that deductions and credits
and basically everything about taxes provide
tons of confusion for taxpayers and a lucrative
income for tax professionals.

Tax deductions and credits relating
to children and education
When you consider the amounts on your tax reports, you should look
closely at any amounts you spent during the year for childcare and educa-
tion costs. Many of these costs can result in either tax deductions or tax
credits and can reduce your income tax substantially.
Dependent care
Costs that you pay to have someone take care of your child (or your disabled
spouse or an elderly or disabled person if that person is your dependent) can
qualify for the dependent care credit. Here are the rules to keep in mind. If
you qualify for this tax credit, be sure to code all of the amounts you pay to
the caregiver to a category assigned to one of these tax lines:
✦Form 2441: Qualifying childcare expenses
✦Form 2441: Qualifying household expenses
The types of expenses that qualify for this credit include the following:
✦Caregiver, including babysitter, housekeeper, cook, maid, governess,
any person who is providing care for the dependent or spouse — the
caregiver can come to your home or you can take the dependent to
the caregiver.
✦Food, if food is part of the care provided.
✦Schooling, if schooling is part of the care provided and is inseparable
from the cost of the caregiver. Schooling can include preschool and
kindergarten costs, but beware that kindergarten costs don’t qualify for
the credit if you live in a state that requires kindergarten.
In order to qualify for the dependent care credit, the following stipulations
must be met:
✦The expenses must be incurred in order for you to work, and must be
incurred during hours while you work.
✦If the dependent is your child, she must be younger than 13 years old.
✦If you are married, both you and your spouse must work during the time
the care is given.
✦You must live in the same home as the dependent receiving the care.
✦The person providing the care is not your spouse, nor is it another
dependent of yours. If the person providing the care is another child of
yours, that child must be at least age 19.

Analyzing Your Deductions
410
✦You must include the name, address, and Social Security number or fed-
eral ID number of the person or organization providing the care on your
income tax return.
The amount of the credit is a percentage of the total amount you spent, and
that percentage decreases from a maximum of 35 percent to a minimum of 
20 percent of your actual expenses as your income increases. The total
amount of expenses you can use when applying for this dependent care
credit cannot exceed $3,000 per year for one dependent or $6,000 per year
for more than one dependent.
So, for example, if you have two children who are receiving care, and your
income places you in the 30 percent bracket for calculating the dependent
care credit, the most you can claim for the credit is $1,800 or $6,000 x 30 per-
cent. If your expenses were less than $6,000, the credit amount decreases
accordingly.
Higher education costs
Most taxpayers are entitled to take tax benefits for the higher education
costs they incur. Such costs include the tuition and any course-related fees
paid directly to the educational institution, such as lab fees. Costs associ-
ated with room and board and books and supplies do not qualify for the vari-
ous tax benefits available.
Depending on your level of income and the actual amount you spent, you
might qualify for one or more of these tax benefits. I strongly advise you to
speak with a tax professional when considering these benefits, as you might
have a choice to make between various benefits and certainly want to claim
the benefit that saves you the most money.
The tax lines available for these expenses include the following:
✦Form 8863: Hope qual. higher ed. exp
✦Form 8863: Lifetime qual. higher ed. exp
✦Form 1040: Tuition and fees deduction
✦Form 1040: Student loan interest
Personally I think these tax lines are misleading (except the last one for stu-
dent loan interest): Until you actually prepare your income tax return, you
probably won’t know which of the education tax credits (Hope Scholarship
Credit or Lifetime Learning Credit) or the tuition and fees deduction or even
the education deduction available under itemized deductions on Schedule A
will give you the better tax break.

Chapter 3

I think it’s wiser to not assign a tax line at all to education expenses, but
instead create an education expense category and tag that category as being
tax-related. Then when you see the amounts on your Tax Summary report,
you can consider those amounts when preparing your income tax return, or
make the information available to your tax professional, and determine the
best course of action for taking either a tax deduction or a tax credit.
Here are the options that might be available to you. Some of these options
are limited based on your taxable income. In general, the more you earn, the
less likely it is you are going to be eligible to take full advantage of the tax
credits or deductions available to you.
✦Hope Scholarship Credit: Available to offset tuition paid for students in
their first two years of a post-secondary education. The student must 
be enrolled as at least a half-time student in a program that leads to a
degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential. The stu-
dent must be you, your spouse, or your dependent. If the student is 
your dependent, he or she must be claimed as your dependent on your
income tax return. The credit is 100 percent of the first $1,000 paid for
tuition, and 50 percent of the second $1,000 paid for tuition, for a total of
$1,500 for one tax year.
✦Lifetime Learning Credit: Available to offset tuition paid for students
attending courses at any qualified education institution. The courses do
not have to be part of a degree or certificate program and the student
(you, yourself, or your dependent child), does not have to be enrolled
full-time or half-time, but instead can be taking as few or as many
courses as he or she likes. The credit is 20 percent of the first $10,000
spent on education over the student’s lifetime, with a maximum of
$2,000 credit per year.
✦Tuition and fees deduction: If you don’t take a credit for education
expenses, you might qualify for the tuition and fees deduction for your-
self, your spouse, or your dependent. This isn’t an itemized deduction,
so you don’t need to file Schedule A with your tax return to take advan-
tage of this. Depending on how much income you earned you might be
able to deduct as much as $4,000 of tuition and course-related fees. Like
the Lifetime Learning Credit, the student does not have to be enrolled in
a degree or certificate program.
✦Student loan interest: Where tuition is being paid, there often are stu-
dent loans, and where there are student loans, there is interest. Again,
depending on your income, you might be able to deduct as much as
$2,500 in student loan interest paid during the year. The loan must be for
higher education costs for yourself, your spouse, or your dependent.
Unlike the other education-related tax benefits described above, the stu-
dent loan interest can be interest on a loan for not just tuition but also
room and board, books, and supplies.

The IRS instructions that accompany Form 1040 contain worksheets for

I
n 1984, while the Baltimore Colts were sneaking out of their locker rooms
in the middle of the night and moving to their new home in Indianapolis’s
Hoosier Dome, two gentlemen in San Diego, Scott Cook and Tom Proulx,
founded the company called Intuit and introduced the world to the first
version of Quicken. Remarkably, in the same year and the same southern
California town, a man named Mike Chipman created a little program he
called TurboTax. Years passed and eventually these financial software wiz-
ards pooled their talents. Today, Quicken and TurboTax are both produced
by Intuit, where they happily work together, ready to provide you with the
tools you need to create your income tax returns and survive April 15th.
Telling TurboTax about Your Quicken Information
Whoa! Before you send your Quicken information over to TurboTax, you have
to take care of a couple of housekeeping tasks. You want to make sure that the
data in Quicken is complete and ready to go to your tax return, don’t you?
Take a few minutes to make sure these steps have been completed in Quicken.
This ensures that the information that travels over from Quicken to TurboTax
is exactly the information you want to include on your income tax return:
✦Open the category list (Ctrl+C or Shift+Ctrl+C) and examine the tax line
assignments you have made. If the tax lines aren’t displayed, check the
Display Tax Information box at the top of the list. Scroll through the list,
taking the time to read each category and assigning all of the tax-related
categories to the appropriate tax line.
It wouldn’t hurt to print a copy of your category list and show your tax
line assignments to a tax professional. It will only take a short amount of
the tax pro’s time to review the list and make sure you have your tax
line assignments completed correctly.

Telling TurboTax about Your Quicken Information
414
✦View or print a copy of the Tax Schedule report and examine this report
closely. This is the information that you’re going to send to TurboTax.
Look for amounts that seem inconsistent with what you know you
earned or spent during the year. Look for omissions of categories that
ought to appear here. For example, if you know you donated to charity
last year and you want to take a deduction for your donations on your
tax return, make sure that the Cash Charity Contributions line appears
on your report.
✦Make a backup file of your Quicken data. I don’t expect you to have any
problems, but just to be extra extra sure, back up your data in Quicken
so that you can always re-create your data if there is an emergency. See
Appendix A for details on how the backup process works.
If you haven’t gotten around to assigning tax lines to your various categories
in Quicken, you can’t move forward with the import information in this chap-
ter. TurboTax is good, but not that good. You have to give the program a little
guidance as to how the various categories relate to your income tax return.
So what’s so cool about TurboTax?
If you are new to using tax software, you’re in
for a treat. It’s easy to prepare your income tax
return with the help of TurboTax, and the end
result is quite professional-looking. One of my
favorite features is the fact that if you decide
you need to change a number on the return, the
program goes through and re-adds everything,
so all of the forms and schedules reflect the
change. Here are some other reasons that
make TurboTax appealing:
 The easy Q&A format is designed to cover
all the information you need to prepare a
complete income tax return.
 You can prepare both federal and state tax
returns in TurboTax, and, if you moved
during the year, you can produce state
returns for each state you lived in, and
TurboTax makes it easy to divide your
income properly between the states.
 TurboTax extracts the information you
entered all year in Quicken, so you don’t
have to reassemble information you’ve
already collected.
 You can prepare your entire tax return from
start to finish in this ready-to-file product.
 Tips to help you better understand taxes
and to help you find all the deductions
you deserve are scattered throughout the
program.
 The basic information you enter in TurboTax
one year rolls over into the next year’s
return, making the setup process for future
tax returns much easier.
 You’ll save an enormous amount of time
preparing your tax return when you use
TurboTax.
 No math errors!
 Planning tools that come with the program
teach you how you can lower your taxes.

When assigning tax lines, you might have noticed that Quicken automatically
assigns a lot of the tax lines for you — at least in the most recent versions of
the program. So a lot of the guesswork has been removed regarding which
tax lines go with which categories.
As of press time, I resorted to using TurboTax 2004 in order to accomplish
the steps shown in this chapter. It’s possible that the screens and commands
for future years of TurboTax software will change and that the steps described
here will not match with your experience. I can say, however, that TurboTax
has traditionally been an intuitive program. If you read the TurboTax screens
carefully, you should be able to figure out how to work the import process.
Getting started in TurboTax
When you’re ready to experiment with importing your data to TurboTax, and
your Quicken file is all backed up and safe, these are the steps you’re going
to follow:
1. Open TurboTax and choose Start Return to get started using TurboTax.
2. Decide whether you want to transfer information from your prior tax
return.
If you used TurboTax the year before to prepare your tax return, you are
given an option to transfer some of the information from last year’s tax
return into this year’s tax return. Transferring makes great sense. It’s the
busy-work part of the return that transfers — information like your
name and address and the names of your kids, the names of the jobs you
had last year, and so on. Numbers don’t transfer, so you don’t have to
worry about getting last year’s income and expenses all jumbled up with
this year’s transactions. If you didn’t use TurboTax last year, transferring
is not an option. To begin your tax return without transferring data from
last year, click Continue Without Transferring.
3. Choose your filing status.
Transferred returns skip over the filing status question at first, proceeding
with the assumption that you will use the same filing status as last year.
Non-transfers see the filing status options (Figure 4-1). Pick the status that
applies to you (click the Guide Me button if you’re not sure which status is
correct), and then click Continue to move to the next step.
Occasionally you are prompted to save your file in the TurboTax pro-
gram. These prompts don’t come frequently enough for my taste. At any
time you can save the information you’ve entered by choosing File➪Save
from the TurboTax menu. The first time you try to save your return, you
need to give the file a name. TurboTax offers a name for you such as
“2005LastnameFirstinitialTaxReturn.tax.” I highly recommend you take
the name that is offered — using the standard TurboTax filename makes
finding your file a lot easier for next year’s TurboTax program.

Telling TurboTax about Your Quicken Information
416
4. Enter name and address, Social Security number, and occupation.
Verify the information that transferred from the prior year return and
make changes as necessary. If you didn’t transfer from a prior year, fill 
in blanks when prompted to enter name and address, Social Security
number, and occupation.
Because this is a book about Quicken and not a book about TurboTax
(and alas, my TurboTax For Dummies is out of print), I’m going to skip
pretty quickly over the technical aspects of the TurboTax program, so
that I can focus on importing Quicken information into your tax return.
Do not rely on the TurboTax material presented here as being a com-
plete description of how to prepare your tax return.
5. Answer a few questions by checking or leaving the various boxes
blank (see Figure 4-2). If you are filing a joint tax return, there is a
check box for both you and your spouse.
• Can the taxpayer be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax
return?
• Did the taxpayer serve in the armed forces last year?
• Is the taxpayer legally blind?
• Did the taxpayer die before the year ended?

6. Enter information about dependents.
Confirm the dependent information transferring from last year’s tax
return, or enter the name, relationship, date of birth, type of dependent
(child that lived with you, child that didn’t live with you, teenager that
eats at your house but doesn’t speak to you, and so on), and Social
Security number of each of your dependents.
7. Here’s a key question: Answer Yes when asked if you want to import
info from Quicken.
When the screen shown in Figure 4-3 appears, click Yes to initiate the
import process. On the next screen you are asked to identify which pro-
gram you use that contains your financial information. Click the check
box to choose Quicken, and then click Continue to proceed to the next
screen.
If you use a password to protect your Quicken data, you are asked to
supply that password when TurboTax accesses your Quicken file.
Don’t worry about the fact that you’ve got more than one year of data
stored in your Quicken file. All of your Quicken transactions are dated,
and TurboTax knows what year it is. Only the information from the cor-
rect year is imported into your tax return.
8. Continue using the TurboTax program, answering questions, moving
from screen to screen.
Figure 4-2:

9. Indicate if you want to import specific financial data.
The first opportunity you have to import information from Quicken is
when you are asked if you want to import a variety of types of income,
including pension income, Social Security, income tax refunds, income
reported on 1099-MISC forms, and so on. If you want to import the kind
of financial information shown in Figure 4-4, click Yes. Otherwise click
No, and Quicken proceeds without performing an import at this time.
10. Confirm the import of specific amounts.
Just like a kitty bringing home a mouse for your approval, when
TurboTax imports data from your Quicken program, it shows you what it
found, as displayed in Figure 4-5. Only then do you have to commit to
actually importing the specific amount into your tax return. If you see an
amount that belongs in your tax return, check the box next to that item.
If you don’t want to transfer an imported item, uncheck the box. After
checking and unchecking boxes, click Import Now if there are checked
boxes for items that need to be imported. Click Skip Import if there is
nothing you want to import at this time.
Be careful with the timing of your tax return preparation. If you upgrade
your Quicken to a new version (typically Quicken upgrades occur in the fall)
and you haven’t yet prepared your tax return for the previous year, your
TurboTax and your Quicken programs might not talk to each other.

Importing information from your tax lines
The import process will become routine as you make your way through
TurboTax. As you continue the preparation of your tax return, periodically
you’ll see screens that ask if you want to import information from your
Quicken program (Figure 4-6). Nothing is imported automatically, and this is
the way it should be. You need to give your permission for TurboTax to go
and get the pieces of information that make up your tax return.
To agree to the import, click the Yes button. Another screen appears (Figure
4-7), showing you exactly what TurboTax found when it scrounged around in
your Quicken program. You can check the boxes and choose to accept these
amounts in which case TurboTax incorporates them into your tax return, or
you can leave the boxes unchecked and tell TurboTax to take a hike, as it
were, at least regarding these bits of information.
In case you were wondering, when you take numbers out of your Quicken
program to incorporate in your TurboTax tax return, nothing changes in
Quicken. The import process from TurboTax doesn’t actually take these
numbers away from Quicken, it just borrows the information, leaving your
Quicken file exactly the way you left it.
Quicken alone isn’t enough support to satisfy the IRS. When you prepare your
tax return based on numbers that appear in your Quicken program, you still
need to keep receipts that support those numbers. I recommend printing a
copy of your Tax Schedule report and saving it in a file along with a copy of
your tax return and copies of all of the receipts that relate to that tax return.
Importing is not an all-or-nothing process
Importing from Quicken is not an all-at-once
process, and it’s not an all-or-nothing process.
Here are some points about how the import
process works:
 The import process goes step by step as
you prepare your return; you can see what
is imported as you go and make changes as
necessary.
 Each time you get to a new topic in
TurboTax, you are asked if you want to
import data on that topic.
 TurboTax presents a list of what has been
imported — you can review the list and

The IRS requires that you save your receipts for at least three years. After
three years, it’s OK to discard the miscellaneous receipts that support your
tax data, but you should still keep a copy of your tax return and a copy of
your W-2 forms. The W-2 forms are your evidence of tax that you paid (had
withheld) during the year.

If you like using the Internet, you might really enjoy using TurboTax’s Web-
based program. The online version of TurboTax operates just like the store-
bought version, only you prepare your return entirely at the TurboTax Web
site instead of on your hard drive. You don’t have to prepare the return all at
once — you can start the return and come back at a later time to finish.
Types of federal income tax returns
There are three types of federal income tax
returns. See the requirements below to decide
which return is right for you:
The simplest federal income tax return around,
the 1040EZ is only available for certain taxpay-
ers. You must meet the following requirements
to file a 1040EZ. (Note, these are the require-
ments for 2005. The limitation amounts might
vary for future years.)
 Taxable income for the year is less than
$100,000.
 Your filing status is either Single or Married
Filing Jointly.
 You do not claim any dependents.
 You do not claim any adjustments to
income (such as IRA contribution, moving
expense, student loan interest, higher edu-
cation costs, or educator expenses).
 You are under the age of 65.
 Your interest income does not exceed $1,500.
The 1040A is more complex than the 1040EZ, but
not as complex as the standard 1040. This is the
mama bear of tax returns. You can file on a
1040A form if you meet these requirements.
 Taxable income for the year is less than
$100,000.
 You have no capital gains or losses except
capital gain distributions, such as from a
mutual fund.
 You claim only certain tax credits: child tax
credit, education credits, earned income
credit, credit for child and dependent care
expenses, adoption credit, elderly and
retirement savings credits.
 You claim only certain deductions: IRA con-
tributions, student loan interest, higher
education tuition and fees, and educator
expenses.
 You do not claim itemized deductions.
If you don’t qualify for either the 1040EZ or the
1040A, you are required to use Form 1040 for your
federal income tax return. You can use the 1040
to report all types of income and deductions and
credits. In fact, if you like, you can use the 1040
even if you qualify for the 1040EZ or the 1040A.

One really nice feature of using TurboTax on the Web is that you can prepare
the return without any up-front payment. This is a great way to experiment
with TurboTax and see if you like the program before you either (a) com-
plete your tax return online and file the return electronically from the
TurboTax Web site, or (b) decide to purchase the software and use it on
your own computer.
Follow these steps to get started using TurboTax on the Web:
1. Go to www.turbotax.com and follow the links to get to the online
TurboTax program.
From the TurboTax home page, click either 1040EZ, Basic, or Premier to
begin the tax preparation process (see Figure 4-8). If you are certain you
will file a 1040EZ form (see the “Types of federal income tax returns”
sidebar) you can click this option. If you have a business and know you
want the extra advice that comes with the business program, you can
click the third option. Most taxpayers probably choose the Basic option.
If you’re not sure whether you qualify to file the 1040EZ return or not, go
ahead and click the 1040EZ option. You have to answer a series of ques-
tions before you proceed, and from your answers, TurboTax determines
whether you qualify for the return. If you don’t qualify, you’re sent back
to pick another return, and then you can choose the Basic return.
Agreeing to TurboTax’s terms
TurboTax’s user agreement basically states that
if you enter false information on your tax return
and you get caught, any penalties or prosecu-
tion that befall you are your own problem and
not TurboTax’s fault.
The agreement also states that if you choose to
file your tax return electronically through the
TurboTax Web site, it’s up to you to come back
and make sure the IRS and any state taxing
authority to which you submit your tax return
actually accept the return.
If you did something wrong that prevented your
return from being successfully filed electroni-
cally (like enter the wrong birth date when
asked for this identifying information), it’s not
TurboTax’s fault if you failed to check back and
straighten out the problem.
This is a key issue if you’re filing your tax return
really close to the deadline, which is a common
occurrence with the online filing process. You
must remember to go back and check to make
sure everything went through OK. To help you
with this step, TurboTax is willing to send you
an e-mail message to remind you of the need to
check back.

2. Get started.
Indicate if you’re new to TurboTax or if you’ve been there, done that. If
you are a returning user, you’ll avoid having to enter some of the repeti-
tive information like your name, rank, and serial number. I’ll assume
you’re new to TurboTax for the Web and proceed accordingly.
Choose whether you want to establish a user ID now or just play around
for a bit without saving anything. Choosing an ID lets you save your data
for later use. In either case, you have to agree to the user agreement
(see the “Agreeing to TurboTax’s terms”) before you can continue.
Click the Start a New Return option.
Before you go any farther — go find your copy of last year’s tax return.
That is the most important tool to have around when preparing a new
return.
It’s not a bad idea to create a User ID for your online tax return. If you
have to get up and leave the computer for awhile, your session is at risk
of being automatically terminated (TurboTax lets your screen sit idle for
20 minutes, and then cuts you off). If you’ve got a User ID, you can get
right back to where you left off. If you have no ID, you have to start over
again from the beginning. You can create a User ID at any time by click-
ing the Create User ID button at the top of your TurboTax for the Web
screen.

3. Choose your filing status.
You need to pick your filing status (Figure 4-9) from the options pro-
vided. You’d think this would be easy, but even this can be a compli-
cated decision. You can look at your last year’s tax return for a hint, or
you can get help from TurboTax. There’s a little Guide Me button to click
if you’re not sure which status to choose. Click this button and you are
asked some more questions that help you zero in on which status is the
right one for you.
After you’ve chosen the filing status, and from now on, after each step,
click the Continue option to proceed.
4. Enter the personal information that TurboTax requests.
You are required to fill in all the blanks. Notice in Figure 4-10 that there is
a field for your birth date in addition to the name, address, and Social
Security number fields. The birth date information doesn’t appear any-
where on your tax return. Nevertheless, you shouldn’t fudge on the date,
even if you’re temped to shave a few years off your age. The birth date is
one of the things that is used to identify you to the IRS. In order to file
your tax return electronically, you must provide the correct birth date.
Don’t sweat the small stuff — in this case, the slashes and the dashes.
You can enter your birth date without slashes and your Social Security
number without dashes — TurboTax fills in these missing pieces for you.

5. Pick a location.
Indicate whether you’re based in the States, at a military base, in a for-
eign country, or in a U.S. possession.
6. Enter your mailing address.
7. Pick the state where you resided on December 31 of the tax year, and
then indicate if you lived in that state (even if you moved to a differ-
ent address within the state) all year.
8. Enter your occupation and your daytime phone number.
There’s really no right or wrong answer when it comes to entering your
occupation. The IRS likes to try to pigeonhole people in certain occupa-
tions and see if they claim appropriate deductions. Thus, if you enter that
you are a teacher, no one is surprised if you take a deduction for teaching
supplies. But if you say you’re a teacher and then take deductions for trav-
eling salesman-related expenses, that might raise a few eyebrows. On the
other hand, you can make up a name for your occupation, such as Rising
Star or Fly in the Ointment, and nothing bad is going to happen to you.
9. Answer the questions.
Here we are again — we saw these questions earlier when discussing
TurboTax the program. Check the boxes if any of the circumstances in
Figure 4-11 apply to you.

10. Enter dependent info.
If you’ve got kids or other people you take care of, you might be able to
claim them as your dependents. If you know for sure you can claim the
dependents on your tax return, go ahead and click Yes and enter the
requested information about each dependent. If you’re not sure if some-
one qualifies as a dependent or not, click the Guide Me button, and you’ll
get some more questions that will help you determine how to proceed.
11. Finally! Time to import from Quicken.
Click Yes when asked if you’re ready to import your information from
Quicken. You have to click the Yes button shown in Figure 4-12 in order
to have access to Quicken for the rest of your tax return.
12. Choose between Entire Interview and Customized Interview.
You’re going to get a question about whether you want your interview 
to be Entire or Customized. If you pick the Entire interview, this means
that, for this section (income) of your tax return, you have the pleasure
of seeing every question that TurboTax can think of to ask you about
your income from every source imaginable. If you already know what
types of income you have to report on your tax return, you can choose
the Customized option. With Customized, you see a list of the various
types of income and you just check off the income types that apply to
you. The only questions you see in your TurboTax interview are the
questions that relate to your types of income.

13. Pick Income items.
If you went with the Customized interview, as I did, you’re going to see a
list of the various types of income that you might have to report on your
tax return. Check off each income type that applies to you.
14. Indicate your willingness to import from Quicken.
When asked if you’re ready to import from Quicken, answer Yes. You
might be directed to log off from the TurboTax program you’re using (be
sure to establish a User ID before doing so) and reenter the TurboTax
program from within Quicken. These step-by-step instructions appear on
the TurboTax screen.
15. Return to TurboTax and proceed with the import.
If you left TurboTax in the last step, follow the onscreen steps to return
to the program, and then respond by clicking Yes to any import ques-
tions (see Figure 4-13).

16. Choose the items to import.
Whenever TurboTax gets information from Quicken that fits with an area
of your tax return, a list of the found information appears. Just as you
saw back in Figure 4-7, you can place a checkmark next to any item you
want to import from Quicken, and uncheck any amount that you don’t
want to import. Click Import Now and the rest is magic. TurboTax takes
the numbers provided by Quicken and places them in exactly the right
places on your tax return.
17. Continue until your tax return is completed.
Continue working through the TurboTax screens, clicking Continue to
move from one screen to the next (or Back if you want to return to a pre-
vious screen), responding to questions, and entering or importing the
information necessary for the completion of your tax return.
To print any of the forms you create in TurboTax for the Web, you must
pay the fee for the Web service. The type of tax service you chose when
you began using the program (1040EZ, Basic, or Premier) determines the
amount of fee you are required to pay. After you’ve paid the fee, you can
print any or all of the forms you’ve created at any time. Click the Filing
button at the top of the TurboTax for the Web page to print copies of
forms suitable for filing with the tax authorities. Click the Finish button to
print forms for your records. The forms you print for your records include
supporting worksheets that don’t get submitted to the tax authorities.

T
he Beatles warned us in Tax Man: “That’s one for you, nineteen for me.”
Estimated taxes are nature’s way of reminding you that the IRS is watch-
ing. Just when you think you’ve got plenty of money in the bank, bam! It’s
time to zero-out your balance and send it all to Uncle Sam.
Understanding Estimated Taxes
Many people can handle their federal tax liability by having income taxes
withheld from their paycheck. Are they lucky? Maybe. Some people who
swear by estimated taxes would say the wage earners are dupes, letting the
government take their money without asking (and you can choose for your-
self who you think I’m referring to with the pronoun, “their”). Others, who
are burdened by estimated taxes, yearn for the simple lifestyle of wage-
earners, where you don’t have to calculate how much your tax is going to
be; instead, you just let your employer take tax out of your check and you
hope for a fat refund in the spring.
No matter how you feel about paying taxes, the bottom line is that you have
to find a way to come up with the bottom line. You calculate the tax on your
tax return each spring, but you are required to have paid that tax through-
out the previous year or else you can be assessed penalties and interest for
late payment. In order to avoid the extra fees, you might be faced with
having to estimate taxes.
If your only income is the income you earn from your employer, you can
count on your employer to use the information you provided on your W-4
form (see Book I, Chapter 1) to calculate and withhold enough tax so that
you won’t owe any penalties in the spring. But for many people, the income
from one job isn’t the only income that appears on their tax return.

Understanding Estimated Taxes
432
Some people have two jobs; with some married couples, each person has
one or more jobs. Or you may have interest and dividend income on invest-
ments, odd-job money, and money from a variety of other sources, all of
which needs to be reported on your tax return. Then there are the deduc-
tions. As you saw in earlier chapters of this book, many different methods
are available for reducing your taxes with deductions and credits.
Calculating the actual amount of tax you owe in advance is truly an art.
The rules state that if you don’t have enough tax withheld at your job(s), you
need to make up the difference by paying estimated taxes quarterly, or four
times a year. Now there’s a little cushion allowed — you can owe as much as
$1,000 beyond your withholding and pay that amount with your tax return, and
the IRS isn’t going to hit you with penalties. But owe more than $1,000, and
watch out. The IRS expects you to either pay a penalty for paying your taxes
late or have a darn good excuse for not paying enough tax throughout the year.
Excuses that help you avoid the penalty
for late payment of taxes
If you owe more than $1,000 on your federal
income tax return, you also owe a penalty for
late payment, unless you can show that one of
these situations exists:
 You didn’t have an income tax liability for
the preceding tax year. This isn’t the same
as saying you had enough tax withheld in
the preceding year so that you got a refund
on last year’s tax return. What this excuse
means is that you actually didn’t owe any
tax in the preceding year. If you look on that
tax return from a year ago and the “Total
Tax” amount is a big fat zero, this excuse
will fly. If there was any tax, even a dollar,
you had a tax liability for the preceding year
and you can’t use this excuse.
 The tax you paid for the current year in
withholding or estimated taxes is at least
equal to 100 percent of the tax on last year’s
tax return. The tax you paid for this year has
to at least equal whatever amount appears
on last year’s tax return on the “Total Tax”
line. So, say it’s April of 2007 and you wonder
if you’re going to have to pay a penalty
because you owe $1,200 in tax on your 2006
tax return. Look back at the “Total Tax” on
the 2005 tax return and see how much that
is. If your withholding and other tax pay-
ments for 2006 equal at least as much as
that total tax amount on the 2005 tax return,
you’re penalty-free. (Note: If your adjusted
gross income on that 2005 tax return was
higher than $150,000, you have to have paid
in 110 percent of the tax on that return in
order to avoid the penalty for 2006.)
 You paid at least 90 percent of this year’s
income tax throughout the year in with-
holding or estimated taxes. Here’s where
the guesswork comes in. You have to esti-
mate your taxes throughout the year and
make sure your tax payments come up to at
least 90 percent of the amount that appears
on your tax return in the spring. The infor-
mation in this chapter will help you come
up with that estimate.

Book V
Chapter 5
Tax Planning
with Quicken
Calculating Estimated Taxes
433
Calculating Estimated Taxes
The estimated payments are supposed to be a reflection of what you think
you’re going to owe on your tax return in the coming year. Somehow you
have to come up with a total amount that you expect to owe, subtract the
amount of tax you expect to have withheld at your job(s), and pay the rest
in estimated taxes. If you happen to have a functioning crystal ball, you can
just look inside, read what it says you’re going to owe, divide it by four, and
pay one-fourth of the total with each quarterly payment.
To make life a little easier, the IRS has devised methods you can use to esti-
mate your taxes. And to make life easier still, Quicken has its tax planner
that you can use as well. But first, some basic information.
If you have to make quarterly tax payments, the IRS expects you to split the
total amount you owe into fourths and pay the same amount each quarter.
Leaving the total amount until the fourth quarter and paying it all at once
negates the effect of the estimated payment program and, worse yet, can still
result in an underpayment penalty and interest.
You can choose from three methods for estimating taxes, and these methods
are derived from the three excuses you can use to get out of paying taxes
described in the sidebar, “Excuses that help you avoid the penalty for late
payment of taxes,” earlier in this chapter. We use Quicken’s Tax Planner to
come up with the actual amount of your estimate for the current year taxes.
For now, just worry about getting the methods down.
FYI, the first method, the one based on last year’s taxes, is the most common
method used, and for that you don’t need any estimating: You just need a
copy of last year’s tax return.
If you like to work out your tax estimates on paper, you can use the worksheet
provided with the IRS instructions for estimated taxes. Here’s the URL for the
instructions and the worksheet if you want to grab this from the Internet:
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf.
Estimated taxes Method #1: 
Using last year’s tax return
Probably the safest way to estimate your taxes for the purpose of making
quarterly payments (and avoiding penalties and keeping the IRS off your
back) is to start with your previous year’s federal income tax return.
These estimated tax rules are probably similar to the rules you need to con-
sider for your state income taxes. That’s right! Don’t forget to pay tax to your
state! Check the tax laws for your own state to see how to do the estimated
taxes, but you’re probably going to see much similarity between the way you
compute estimated taxes federally and the way you do it, uh, stately . . .

Calculating Estimated Taxes
434
So that I won’t keep getting caught up in confusing statements about this
year, next year, and last year, I’m going to refer to the year 2005 as last year,
2006 as this year, and 2007 as next year. So if you’re reading this book in the
spring of 2006 when you’re preparing your 2005 income tax return, you’re
going to be right with me. If it’s a later year, add a year or two to each of my
sample years and go from there.
OK, so back to Method #1. It’s the spring of 2006, and you’re trying to figure
out how much to pay during 2006 for estimated taxes.
For Method #1, you want to get out your 2005 income tax return (if you
haven’t prepared your 2005 tax return yet, get busy with that, and then come
back when you’ve got the return completed). Look on the line that says
“This is your total tax.” Figure 5-1 shows the tax section of the 2005 Form
1040 — I’m looking at Line 63.
That total tax number is the number you want to match with your 2006 tax
payments. Now, if you think your tax withholding is going to be high enough
to cover that amount, you don’t have to worry about estimates. If you aren’t
going to have enough tax withheld, get busy with some estimated payments
to make up the difference.
Say for example that your total tax on the 2005 income tax return is $6,000.
You expect your tax withholding to be about $4,000 in 2006. Therefore, using
Method #1, your estimated payments should be $2,000, or $500 each quarter.
If your adjusted gross income (see line 37 of the 2005 Form 1040) is more
than $150,000, the tax you pay in during the coming year should be 110 per-
cent of the 2005 tax instead of 100 percent.
If your income fluctuates during the year, you might not have to make equal
quarterly estimates. In fact, you might even be able to skip an estimated pay-
ment and not pay in every quarter. See the section on annualizing your
income for more information on dealing with fluctuating income.
Your total tax paid during the year should be within $1,000 of the total
amount of tax still owing on your tax return. That doesn’t mean you should
short your estimates by $1,000. The $1,000 is a cushion so that if your esti-
mated payments, based on your calculations, come up short, you still have
some playing room before any penalties kick in.

section of
Form 1040.

Chapter 5

I’m giving you line numbers for Form 1040. Some people have tax returns
that are uncomplicated enough that they can get away with filing the simpler
tax returns, 1040A or 1040EZ. In that case, the line numbers are going to be
different. But the descriptions are the same. Just look for the line that points
out your total tax — it’s on each return; it just may be on a different line.
Estimated taxes Method #2:
Using this year’s tax return
Now we get into the fun part of estimating. Using Method #2, you can choose
to pay 90 percent of the current year’s tax (that is, if you can figure out what
the current year’s tax is going to be). (See the section “Estimating Taxes with
Quicken’s Tax Planner” later in this chapter.)
When you figure out your current year’s tax, you take 90 percent of that
amount, and then deduct what you think your income tax withholding is
going to be. The remaining amount represents the amount you should 
pay in estimated payments, so divide that by four and there you go.
For example, suppose you estimate your 2006 tax to be $8,000 and, based on
your current paychecks, you think your withholding for the year is going to
be $5,000. Therefore you have a $3,000 shortfall to make up. The IRS expects
you to pay 90 percent of this shortfall in estimated payments, so 90 percent
of $3,000 is $2,700. Divide that amount by four and you get $675 for each
quarterly payment.
If your income situation changes during the year, so should your tax pay-
ments. If you get a raise at work, your withholding increases, but so does
your total income and therefore so does your tax. Whenever there’s a meas-
urable change in your income or expenses, redo your estimates to make sure
you are covered.
Estimated taxes Method #3:
Annualizing your income
The third method of figuring out payments of estimated tax is called annual-
izing your income. In order to use this method, you have to monitor your
income and expenses during the year and base your estimated payments on
actual income rather than on estimates. This method is particularly useful
for people whose income fluctuates during the year. Here are some examples
of people who can really benefit from the annualization method of determin-
ing estimated payments:
✦Seasonal workers
✦People who change jobs during the year

Calculating Estimated Taxes
436
✦Self-employed people who don’t have a lot of control over when their
income is received
✦People who incur a sizeable deductible expense during the year
With the annualization method, taxpayers can pay more tax at the times when
they are earning more money, and less tax when their receipts are down or
their expenses are up.
The goal when annualizing your income is to determine what your full year’s
earnings would be if you continued to earn at the same pace at which you
have earned income thus far during the year. To annualize your income for a
particular estimated payment, you should follow these steps:
1. Figure out your actual income for all the months of the year prior to
the month in which the quarterly payment is due.
2. Divide the amount from step 1 by the number of months represented,
and then multiply that amount by 12.
This gives you the amount of total income you would earn if everything
stayed the same for the rest of the year.
3. Perform steps 1 and 2 on your itemized deductions so that you have
an estimate of the total amount of your itemized deductions for the
entire year.
4. Compare your itemized deductions that you calculated in step 3 to 
the Standard Deduction (the Standard Deductions are listed back in
Chapter 3). Take the greater amount and deduct that amount from
your income that you calculated in step 2.
5. Deduct your exemptions from the amount calculated in step 4.
Exemptions for 2006 are expected to be $3,300 a head, which means
that you’re going to deduct $3,300 for yourself, another $3,300 if you
have a spouse and file a joint tax return, and another $3,300 for each
of your dependents. The result is your annualized taxable income.
Personal exemption amounts increase each year, generally about $100
with each increase. The exemption amount for 2006 is an estimate, but a
pretty close one. Check with your friendly tax advisor, or try searching
for “Personal Exemption Amount” on the Internet to find the exemption
amount for the year that interests you.
6. Figure out the tax on the taxable income computed in step 5. (See the
section “Estimating Taxes with Quicken’s Tax Planner” later in this
chapter.)

7. Multiply the tax you calculated in step 6 by 90 percent, and then
divide by four.
This is the amount you should pay in estimated tax for the current quarter.
8. Next quarter, do this exercise all over again.
You’ll be so grateful that you use Quicken when it comes to trying to annual-
ize your income. All of those itemized deductions, income from a variety of
sources — it’s all right there, just a Tax Summary report away.
Estimating Taxes with Quicken’s Tax Planner
Ooooo, I love the Quicken Tax Planner! I can play with different tax scenarios
all day long and never get tired of it! I can still remember the days when I
used to have to calculate taxes without the aid of a computer (and in the
really dark ages, I used to calculate taxes without a calculator, if you can
imagine that . . .).
The Tax Planner is designed to give you a quick estimate of the taxes you
owe based on the entries you have made in Quicken. The transactions you
enter get culled and collected in the Tax Planner, and then Quicken shows
you how much you can expect to owe the IRS.
Keep in mind what I’ve mentioned previously when discussing tax reports:
Quicken can’t completely read your mind. You have to actually enter trans-
actions and also assign tax lines to the appropriate categories in order to get
a good estimate from the Tax Planner.
In addition to utilizing the information you’ve already entered in Quicken,
you can use the Tax Planner as a staging area for your own calculations.
Create your own scenarios, entering the information you’ve estimated or 
calculated, and Quicken spits out a tax estimate for you.
For example, you can gather information from tax reports and from your own
receipts and documents to come up with the numbers you need for the annu-
alization method of calculating your estimated taxes, and then plug those
numbers into the Tax Planner and presto! Quicken calculates the tax you owe!
Using the Tax Planner’s default method 
of calculating tax
Without your having to enter any information at all, Quicken gathers all the
information it can find and creates a tax projection for the current year 
(see Figure 5-2). The Tax Planner Summary screen shows your anticipated
income, deductions, and the tax calculation.

Estimating Taxes with Quicken’s Tax Planner
438
When poking around in the Tax Planner, you can always return to the sum-
mary screen by clicking on the Tax Planner Summary link over on the left
side of the Tax Planner window.
The numbers that appear in the Tax Planner Summary are projections, based
on amounts you’ve already entered in Quicken for the current year. The
numbers are enhanced with information from TurboTax (if you choose to
import this information), as described in “Incorporating tax information
from TurboTax into the Tax Planner” below.
You can examine the detail of any of these numbers (and make changes if
you like) by clicking on one of the hyperlinks in the Summary window, or by
clicking the title of the item you want to examine over on the left side of the
window.
When you click any hyperlink, the detail appears, displaying where the infor-
mation came from, and giving you an opportunity to make any changes that
are necessary.
For example, say you want to know what that Other Income amount is that
the Tax Planner is displaying. Click the Other Income link, and the detail of
that income appears (Figure 5-3). I see! Quicken has assumed I’ll have a tax-
able state income tax refund of $189.

For more detail, scroll down to the bottom of the window and you see (as
shown in Figure 5-4) that this assumption about the state tax refund is based
on information that came from the TurboTax import.

You have three choices for how this information can be determined:
✦Use the TurboTax amount, as shown.
✦Enter your own amount by selecting the “User Entered” option and fill-
ing in an amount in the Annual Total column.
✦Click the Quicken Data option (if this option is available to you) and use
the amount that Quicken has calculated based on data already entered in
Quicken, or override that amount and enter your own in the Adjustment
column.
After you make changes in the lower section of the Tax Planner window, click
or tab to a different field, and your changes will be reflected in the upper
part of the window and in the Tax Planner Summary.
If you have tagged various categories as being tax-related, but haven’t
assigned tax lines to the categories, you can print out a Tax Summary report
to use as a guide while entering and checking the information in the Tax
Planner.
Incorporating tax information from TurboTax
into the Tax Planner
When you open the Tax Planner (by choosing Tax➪Tax Planner from the
Quicken menu), you might see a box like the one in Figure 5-5, asking if you
would like to bring your TurboTax information into Quicken’s Tax Planner.
You can click Yes now, or if you don’t want to use the TurboTax information
now but decide to get it later, just go to the menu at any time and choose
Tax➪TurboTax➪Import TurboTax Data File.
The Import TurboTax Files window appears (see Figure 5-6), where you are
to identify the tax file where your TurboTax tax return is saved, then click
OK to import the data. You are asked to confirm that this is the file you want
to import, and then Quicken displays the name(s) that are saved with that
data file. Confirm those names, and the import is completed.
Figure 5-5:
Click Yes to
bring your
TurboTax
info into the
Quicken Tax

Chapter 5

441
The Tax Planner opens up as soon as the import is completed, and is popu-
lated with information from the TurboTax file. When you bring your TurboTax
information into the Tax Planner, Quicken cleverly incorporates last year’s tax
data with the information that it found in your current year Quicken registers
to come up with a very sophisticated tax projection.
Just in case you are worried, importing your TurboTax information into
your Quicken Tax Planner doesn’t have any effect on the rest of your
Quicken program. It’s not like your checking register is going to be filled
up with transactions that come from your tax return — the only place
where the TurboTax information goes is into the Tax Planner.
This might seem like a “Duh” comment to you, but just for the record, you
can’t import TurboTax information into Quicken if you didn’t use TurboTax
for your tax preparation.
Creating tax scenarios
You can create more than one projection with the Tax Planner. Start another
projection from scratch, or use the existing data in the Tax Planner to begin
with, and play around with alternatives. For example, if you want to experi-
ment with the effects of changing from filing as Married Filing Jointly to filing
as Married Filing Separately, you can create a scenario based on the same
information you used in your main project, but change the filing status. Or
try using a scenario with different withholding amounts. The possibilities
are endless.
Figure 5-6:
Identify the
location of
your
TurboTax
data file.

Estimating Taxes with Quicken’s Tax Planner
442
You can create up to three scenarios in addition to your main projection
(and of course you can change existing scenarios, thus providing endless
possibilities). Here’s how:
1. Click the Scenario option on the left side of the Tax Planner.
The screen changes to reflect Tax Planner Options. On the Tax Planner
Options screen (Figure 5-7) are three fields you need to address.
2. Choose the tax year for your scenario.
Your choices are the current year and next year. Note that if you attempt
to choose next year while the Scenarios choice is pointing to Projected
Value, you get a little message telling you that you can’t do that. You
have to select a numbered scenario (see step 4) in order to experiment
with taxes for next year.
Interestingly, there is a note beneath the scenarios telling you that you
need to choose the scenario first. Why Quicken doesn’t just put the 
scenario selection at the top of the list is one of life’s little unanswered
questions.
3. Choose a filing status.
Choose from the usual suspects: Single, Married Filing Jointly, Married
Filing Separately, Head of Household, and Qualifying Widow (also
referred to as Surviving Spouse).
Figure 5-7:
Choose your
scenario
options.

Book V
Chapter 5
Tax Planning

4. Select your scenario (if you haven’t already done so — see step 2).
Choose from Projected Value, or Scenario 1, 2, or 3.
5. Click Next.
6. Enter the information you want to use in your scenario.
7. Copy scenario information from one scenario to another.
If you would like to take the numbers from your Projected Value, or from
another scenario, for use in this scenario, go back and display the sce-
nario with the numbers you want to copy (click the Scenario option on
the left, and then choose the scenario you want). Then click the Copy
menu choice. The Copy Scenario window appears (Figure 5-8). Click the
scenario that is to receive the copied information, and then click OK.
Switch back and forth between your scenarios by clicking the Scenario
option on the left side of the Tax Planner window, and then entering your
choice of scenario in the Scenarios field.
You can compare the results of your scenarios by clicking the Compare
menu choice at the top of the Tax Planner.
Determining the amount of tax you owe
After you’ve verified the accuracy, or at least the reasonableness of the
amounts in the Tax Planner Summary, view the Remaining Tax amount on
the Summary screen. That is the amount that you are working with for your
estimated tax payments.
The amount of tax that appears in the Remaining Tax field is the total amount
of tax still owing for the year, based on the information you entered or the
information Quicken extrapolated in your tax projection. (Of course, if the
box at the bottom of the Planner says Refund Due, you have no tax currently
owing).
Figure 5-8:
Pick which
scenario (or
all three) is
to receive
the copied
information.

Estimating Taxes with Quicken’s Tax Planner
444
Make sure you have taken into account all taxes that you’ve paid when cal-
culating your estimates. Not only is there the withholding from your jobs,
but also you might have already made estimated tax payments this year, or
there might be a refund from last year’s tax return that you chose to apply to
this year’s tax liability.
To determine the amount of estimated tax you owe, divide the Remaining
Tax amount, not by four, but by the number of quarters remaining in the year
(see “When your estimated payments are due,” later in this chapter, to deter-
mine how many payment due dates are remaining).
It’s possible that the amount reflected in the Tax Planner is not the amount
that you actually will owe on your tax return. Here are some factors that can
affect the calculation:
✦You expect your income to substantially decrease. You know better than
Quicken how much money you can expect to earn between now and the
end of the year. If your income is expected to take a dive before year-
end, go back and adjust the income amounts to reflect the anticipated
reduction in income.
✦You anticipate large expenses between now and the end of the year,
expenses that may result in deductions that will have a measurable
effect on your income tax calculation. Perhaps you are going to start
your child in orthodontics, or you need to purchase some equipment for
your business. Whatever the expense, if something large is due before
year-end and you expect to be able to deduct that amount, make some
adjustments to the projection for your expenses.
Creating a tax payments report
Here’s a quick little report you can make to help
find all the income taxes you’ve already paid
this year.
1. Choose Reports➪Tax➪Tax Summary from
the menu.
2. Set the Date Range for Current year.
3. Click the Customize button.
4. Click the Categories tab.
5. Click the Clear All button.
6. Type Fed to get to the Fed category that
appears as a subcategory of Tax. If you want
to see the state income tax you paid, in case
you’re preparing state estimates as well,
click the State (and, if applicable, Local) tax
options as well.
7. Click OK to display the report.

✦You plan on adjusting your withholding before the end of the year. Many
people set their withholding at a low rate early in the year, and then
boost the withholding at the end of the year by filing a new W-4 form
requesting fewer allowances (see Book I, Chapter 1 for more information
on altering your W-4 form). If you expect to increase your withholding,
you can decrease the amount you need to pay in estimated payments.
Adjust the projection accordingly.
✦You plan on selling some stocks before the end of the year, and that 
sale is going to generate a taxable loss. A loss on the sale of investments
can lower the amount of tax you owe, just as a gain can raise the tax.
Determine how much of an effect the sale will have on your taxes by
entering amounts in the Capital Gains and Losses section of the Tax
Planner. And see the next section for more information on how capital
gains and losses are taxed.
Estimating Capital Gains Taxes
The IRS allows taxpayers a special tax rate on profits made in the stock
market or from selling other types of investments. And there are special
rules for losses on the sale of investments as well. In a nutshell, here’s how
these transactions are seen in the eyes of Uncle Sam.
A capital gain is a profit on the sale of an investment item. A profit is deter-
mined as follows:
✦Purchase price. Start with the amount you paid for the investment. Add
any purchase costs, such as broker fees, shipping costs, or any other
costs you paid as part of the purchase price. The total of all of these
costs is your purchase price.
✦Selling price. Determine the amount you receive for the investment.
Subtract any costs of the sale from the amount you receive. The differ-
ence is the selling price.
✦Gain or loss. Subtract the purchase price from the selling price. If the
difference is a positive number, you have a gain on the sale. If the differ-
ence is a negative number, you have a loss.
Short-term gains and losses
The IRS defines the short-term holding period as one year or less. If you
owned the investment that you sold for 365 or fewer days, your gain or loss
is considered a short-term gain or loss.

Estimating Capital Gains Taxes
446
Short-term gains are reduced by short-term losses to produce a net short-
term gain or loss.
Long-term gains and losses
If you owned the investment you sold for more than 365 days, your gain or
loss is considered a long-term gain or loss.
Long-term gains are reduced by long-term losses to produce a net long-term
gain or loss.
Putting the two together
On your tax return, you report all of the sales of your investments on
Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses.
Here are the options for the way in which these gains and losses are taxed:
✦Your short-term sales and your long-term sales are both net gains. The
short-term net gain is taxed just like your other income, at your regular
income tax rates (income tax rates are displayed in Figure 5-9). The long-
term net gain is taxed at a special lower capital gains tax rate. That rate
is 15 percent for most taxpayers, and 5 percent for taxpayers who pay
regular income tax at no more than the 15 percent tax rate.
✦Your short-term sales and your long-term sales are both net losses.
You are entitled to reduce your regular taxable income by the amount of
your capital loss, up to a maximum of $3,000. If your loss exceeds $3,000,
the remaining loss is carried over to next year’s tax return.
✦Your short-term sales are a gain and your long-term sales are a loss
(or there are no long-term sales). The gain on your short-term sales is
reduced by the amount of the long-term loss, if applicable. Any remain-
ing gain is taxed at your regular income tax rate.
✦Your long-term sales are a gain and your short-term sales are a loss
(or there are no short-term sales). The gain on your long-term sales is
reduced by the amount of the short-term loss, if applicable. Any remain-
ing gain is taxed at the special capital gains tax rates described in the
first option, above.
This is a really bare-bones description of how capital gains taxes work and
how long- and short-term sales are treated. As with any tax rules, there are
plenty of exceptions and special rules. If you sell investments, it’s a wise
move to discuss the tax ramifications with a tax professional.

Five important tax things to know about
selling stocks and other investments
 Timing is extremely important. Know how
many days it’s been since you purchased
an investment before you sell the invest-
ment. The tax can be double or more if you
sell an investment before you’ve owned it
for at least 365 days.
 Consider the amount of tax you’re going to
owe on the sale of your investment before
you make the sale. That knowledge might
affect whether or not you want to sell the
investment. For example, you might want to
sell some stock that you’ve owned for a few
months because you’ve made $100 on the
increase in the stock’s value. But if it costs
you $20 in broker’s fees to sell the stock, and
if your regular income tax rate is 35 percent
resulting in $35 in federal income tax, not to
mention what you might owe in state
income tax, that $100 profit is cut to less
than $50. Do you still want to sell?
 Sell a stock at a loss, and then repurchase
shares of the same stock before 30 days
have passed, and do you know what you’ve
got? A wash sale, according to the IRS.
When you have a wash sale, you lose the
opportunity to take advantage of the loss
on the stock on your tax return. Wait 30
days before purchasing the same stock
and you get the tax benefit of the loss.
 Selling an investment that you received as a
gift causes some strange ripples in the tax
laws. Your basis in the investment, or the pur-
chase price, if you will, actually changes
depending on whether you’re going to make
a profit or have a loss on the sale. Check with
your tax advisor before selling gifted items.
 Inherited items come with a stepped-up
basis. The basis, or purchase price of an
inherited item is the value of the item on the
date of the previous owner’s death.

Exploring New Deduction Frontiers
448
Entering capital gain and loss information 
in the Tax Planner
Click the Capital Gains option on the left side of the Tax Planner to open the
Capital Gains and Losses — Schedule D screen (Figure 5-10).
Gains and losses are projected by Quicken based on information already
entered in your Quicken program as well as information that might have
been brought forward from TurboTax.
Click on either Short-Term Gains and Losses or Long-Term Gains and Losses
to open the corresponding worksheets at the bottom of the screen.
You can also enter carryover capital loss information from your prior-year
tax return. If you imported information from TurboTax, it won’t be necessary
for you to enter the carryover information.
Exploring New Deduction Frontiers
Quicken comes with a Deduction Finder that can help you identify tax deduc-
tions that you might not have considered. This is a significant tool because,
as I’ve pointed out before, Quicken can only incorporate deductions into
Figure 5-10:
Enter

about the
sales of
your
investments.

Book V
Chapter 5
Tax Planning

your tax reports if you’ve tagged the categories as being tax-related. If you
don’t know something is deductible, you probably missed out on tagging the
category, and the deduction slips by unnoticed.
Answer easy questions in the Deduction Finder and Quicken can help you
find some deductions to help reduce your income taxes. Follow these steps
to new forms of tax saving:
1. Access the Deduction Finder by clicking the Tax menu, and then
choosing Deduction Finder.
2. Click OK in the little introductory window that appears (Figure 5-11).
3. Choose a type of deduction.
Click the little drop-down menu that appears in the upper-left corner of
the Deduction Finder. Choose from Employee, Homeowner, Individual,
Investor, Medical, and Self-Employed. With each choice, a different list of
deduction categories appears.
4. Pick a deduction category.
Click on one of the choices under the Choose a Deduction heading on
the left side of the Deduction Finder (Figure 5-12). The questions change
depending on the deduction you choose.
5. Click Y or N for each question that appears.
Go through the list, answering each question. Be sure to check an
answer for each question. Based on your answers, Quicken advises you
at the bottom of the Q&A list as to whether you qualify for a deduction.
6. Click More Information to read up on the potential deduction you
might have missed.
7. Click Create a Category if you need to establish a new category for
deductions of this type.
8. Continue going through the deduction list, responding to questions, to
find more deductions.
Figure 5-11:
Read the

info, and
then click
OK.

Paying Estimated Payments

If you find new deductions, be sure to return to the Tax Planner to incorpo-
rate your deductions into your tax projection.
Paying Estimated Payments
Say you’ve determined that you owe estimated payments. The estimates are
paid with Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals (see Figure 5-13).
The only information you need to enter on the Form 1040-ES is your name
and your Social Security number (and the same for your spouse if you’re
filing a joint tax return), your address, and the amount of estimated tax
you’re including with this payment.
Include a check, payable to U.S. Treasury (or IRS, or Uncle Sam, or just about
any variation on the government that you want — don’t worry — they’ll
cash it). Put your Social Security number on the check, just in case it gets
detached from the little voucher form.
Although it’s quick and easy to write IRS as the payee on your check, Frank
Abagnale, consumer fraud specialist, subject of the Stephen Spielberg movie
Catch Me If You Can, and author of the consumer protection guide, The Art of
the Steal, suggests that writing IRS on a check is an open invitation for a
Figure 5-12:

criminal to change the letters to MRS, fill in another name after the MRS, and
cash the check. So be warned — stick with using actual words in the Payee
area of your check.
Now what? You have to know when to make the payments, where to make
the payments, and how the payments should be made. I won’t leave you
hanging — here are the particulars for getting those payments made.
When your estimated payments are due
Although these estimated payments are called quarterly payments, the IRS’s
definition of a quarter might not quite agree with what you and I think when
we consider splitting the year into four equal parts. Here’s the breakdown
for how the IRS expects you to calculate and pay your “quarterly” payments.
✦1st Quarter: Payment is due April 15. If you annualize your income, use
the net income from January through March.
✦2nd Quarter: Payment is due June 15. If you annualize your income, use
the net income from January through May.
✦3rd Quarter: Payment is due September 15. If you annualize your
income, use the net income from January through August.
✦4th Quarter: Payment is due January 15. If you annualize your income,
use the net income from the entire tax year, January through December.
Figure 5-13:

blanks, and
then pop it

Paying Estimated Payments
452
If the 15th of the month ever falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday that
results in the post offices being closed in your state, the tax payment is due
on the business day following the 15th.
Where to send your estimated payments
Pay close attention here. The estimated tax payments do not get sent to the
same address as your tax return. Furthermore, the IRS has a tendency to
change the addresses frequently, just to make sure everyone is paying atten-
tion. Rather than give you addresses that might turn out to be incorrect, you
should look at the instructions for the 1040-ES, the estimated tax form, for
the mailing address.
You can find the 1040-ES instructions, along with a copy of the 1040-ES form
at this URL:
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf
You can also ask the IRS to mail you a copy of the 1040-ES with instructions
by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM.
Paying estimates online or by telephone
You can also pay your estimated tax payments online or by phone.
✦Pay online. If you want to pay online, be sure to give yourself some 
lead time to set this up. Sign on to the Electronic Federal Tax Payment
System (EFTPS), which is a free service available to all taxpayers. Go to
www.eftps.gov on the Internet or call 1-800-555-4477 to receive enroll-
ment information.
✦Pay by credit card. You can pay with your American Express, Discover,
MasterCard, or Visa at one of these two locations, either online or by
telephone. There is a fee for using these services:
Official Payments Corporation, 1-800-272-9829, 
www.officialpayments.com
Link2Gov Corporation, 1-888-729-1040, www.pay1040.com
What happens if I miscalculate or, 
heaven forbid, miss a payment?
It’s penalty time if you pay those estimates late or not at all. The penalty for
underpayment of estimated tax during the year, assuming you don’t qualify for
any of the excuses explained earlier in this chapter, is 5 percent (annual rate).
The IRS also assesses interest on the late payments (the interest rates vary).

Book V
Chapter 5
Tax Planning
with Quicken
Paying Estimated Payments
453
Here’s a tip that might help you budget for estimated payments. Instead of
trying to come up with the cash quarterly, go ahead and pay your estimates
monthly. You can make estimated payments as frequently as you like. Just 
fill out the estimated tax form (Form 1040-ES), choosing a voucher that
applies to the current quarter. Vouchers are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, so if
you’re making a payment in July, that’s considered the third quarter, so use
Voucher #3. Monthly payments can be a lot easier on the bank balance.
Using a last-minute alternative to paying estimates
So, it’s late fall and you do a little tax projection and suddenly realize that
you’re going to owe a whopping amount of tax in the spring. You can wait to
bite the bullet, pay the tax, and chomp on the underpayment penalty too, or
you can employ a sweet little trick that can save you the penalty money,
assuming you can afford to pay the tax right away.
Remember that W-4 form you gave your employer? Fill out a new W-4, alter-
ing the number of allowances you claim, and thus changing your withhold-
ing. The fewer allowances you claim, the more tax is withheld. You can even
request that extra tax be withheld.
What’s the advantage in that? The IRS doesn’t look at the dates on which
your tax is withheld. Instead, the IRS assumes your withholding is performed
evenly, throughout the course of the entire year. Therefore, you can make a
large tax payment in December by arranging to have extra tax withheld from
your paycheck. If you were to make the payment as an estimated payment,
you might be assessed a penalty for the payment not being made on time.

H
ey, how about looking ahead a bit when thinking about our finances?
Having a personal financial plan is more than just a good idea. A finan-
cial plan is just like any other plan for your future. You can either move
through life, one day at a time, without striving for any goals, or you can set
a course and try to follow through. You might not achieve all that you plan
for, or you might achieve more than you could have hoped for. But going
through life without at least the bare bones of a financial plan is like jumping
in the river and starting to swim, without even knowing in which direction
you’re traveling or what awaits you if you reach the shore.
Getting Familiar with Quicken’s Planning Center
When you open the Quicken Planning Center by choosing Planning➪Go to
Planning Center, you see an overview screen that is ready to receive your
financial plan. In addition to the main Plan: Results area, you also see sec-
tions for alerts, plan assumptions, Quicken’s various planners, miscella-
neous tools, the most commonly used calculators, a link for signing up to
receive the Quicken newsletter, and a link to Quicken’s business planning
feature. All of this is displayed in Figure 1-1.
You can also get to the Planning Center quickly by clicking the Financial

Here’s a shortcut for getting to the Planning Center window in a hurry. You
can set the Financial Overview to be your start-up screen every time you
open Quicken. If the Planning tab was the last tab you used when you last
closed Quicken, the Planning Center appears the next time you open Quicken.
Even if you were using the Net Worth or the Tax tab in the Financial Center
when last you closed Quicken, one quick click on the Planning tab, and
you’re right at the Planning Center.
Set the Planning Center as your Quicken home page by following these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Quicken Program from the menu.
The Quicken Preferences window appears, with Startup selected.
2. Click the drop-down arrow in the Startup Preferences window.
3. Choose Financial Overview, as shown in Figure 1-2.
4. Click OK.
From now on, each time you open Quicken, the Financial Overview is
your start-up screen.

Using the planning alerts
You’ve seen these alerts before — they’re your reminder-buddies that tell
you when you’re about to go over the spending limits you’ve set for yourself
or when your favorite stock hits an attractive buying price.
Click the little Show All Alerts button if you want to see a display of all the
alerts that are currently in play. A separate Alerts Center window appears,
listing the alerts accompanied by hyperlinks that rush you over to the exact
spot where you can take care of whatever action is required.
Click the little Set Up Alerts button if you want to establish some new alerts
for yourself. Flip back to the index and look up Alerts to find various places
throughout this book where different types of alerts are addressed.
Peering at the plan results
Hmmm, the Plan Results section of the Planning Center looks pretty barren
when you first drop by for a visit. This is all going to change quickly when
we dig in and actually make our financial plan. When you’re ready, page over
to “Creating Your Own Financial Plan” later in this chapter for the nitty-gritty
on plan set up. For now, just enjoy the scenery because this screen is going
to get quite busy in just a couple of pages.
Our plan is based on assumptions
Continuing down the main stage of the Planning Center, you get to the Plan
Assumptions arena. Here are the basic building blocks of your financial plan.

Right now, these assumptions are in a holding pattern, waiting to hop into
action when you’re ready to begin your financial plan.
You can read through the assumptions, familiarize yourself with the types of
questions you are going to be asked so that you won’t be stumped when the
time comes to step up to the proverbial plate and take a swing at your finan-
cial plan.
The planners have arrived
On the right side of the Planning Center screen is a little box called Planners
(Figure 1-3). These guys are ready to scramble into action as soon as you
give them a click. If your overall financial plan is Uncle Scrooge, these little
planners are the Huey, Duey, and Luey nephews who can help you work
through the kinks in specific areas of your financial life. These planners look
and operate a lot like their brother the Tax Planner, with hyperlinked head-
ings on the left side of the Planner window, fill-in-the-blank options on the
right, and useful calculations on the bottom line. Here’s a rundown of the
Planning team:
✦Retirement Planner: You’re going to hear more about actual retirement
plans and various types of tax-deferred savings in the next chapter, which
is all about retirement plans and the money they produce. Meanwhile,
you should know that the Retirement Planner is the same thing as the
Quicken Financial Plan — and no matter what you call this plan, this is
the means to planning your financial future. With the Retirement/Financial
Planner, you can determine how much money you really need to have 
on hand if you want to retire and not end up on the street. Later in this
chapter, we use this planner to help zero in on the year when you actu-
ally can pull the plug on your job.
✦College Planner: Head over to Chapter 4 of this book to experience the
College Planner firsthand and find out if you’re really going to be able to
send your children to college or if they’re going to have to get busy and
start applying for scholarships. This is a good dry run for those delight-
ful experiences with the FAFSA form, the form all parents of college stu-
dents know and love — it’s almost as much fun as filling out a tax return.

✦Home Purchase Planner: Described back in Book IV, Chapter 3, the Home
Purchase Planner is designed to help you determine whether you can
actually afford the home you want to buy. Quicken looks at all of your
income and existing debt and helps you determine the amount you can
place as a down payment and the amount of monthly mortgage pay-
ments you can afford. Then, the planner goes on to help you with filling
out a loan application, and even directs you to Internet loan sites where,
if you like, you can apply for a loan from the comfort of your laptop.
✦Debt Reduction Planner: How much is too much debt? Quicken helps
you get a handle on the answer to that question with the Debt Reduction
planner, a tool for measuring your debt against your ability to repay the
amounts you owe. This planner is explained in detail in Book IV, Chap-
ter 2, where the concept of maximizing the value of the money you use
to reduce your debt is discussed.
✦Special Purchase Planner: You can use this planner to help you organ-
ize your finances in order to help make room for a measurably large pur-
chase such as a wedding, an addition to your home, a boat, a ride to the
International Space Station, or whatever strikes your fancy. See Chap-
ter 3 in this book for examples of how to use this planner in conjunction
with setting savings goals.
Tools you can use
Quicken offers lots of tools — you could say the entire program is one great
mass of tools. But here are some tools that specifically appear on the Planning
Center screen. Click any of these tools in the box shown in Figure 1-4 to be
transported to a land of financial bliss (honestly, I haven’t been drinking . . .).
Anyway, here they are, the tools offered to people who are busy working on
their financial plan:
✦Budget: We’ve heard all about the budget before. Book I, Chapter 3 tells
you about what a budget is, how to create a budget with the help of your
family, and somehow manage to remain civil while living under the same
roof. Book IV, Chapter 5 tells you how to automate that budget in Quicken.
That’s what this Budget tool in the Planning Center is all about — a link
to Quicken’s budget feature.

✦Professional Planning: Whoa — this sounds like something beyond
what we bargained for when we purchased our Quicken program. Sure
enough, this is a little training session on picking a financial pro to help
you with all of these monetary mysteries. You’ll be pleasantly surprised
to learn that this link doesn’t offer you sales pitches or links to any kind
of professional planner network organized through Intuit. Instead, there
are useful tips for determining when you need to call in the pros, what 
to look for in a financial professional, and what information you want to
pull together from your Quicken file so that you don’t look like a com-
plete idiot when you meet the planner face to face.
✦Resources: In the Planning Center toolbox is a link to Resources. The
Resources link is a fooler. That link isn’t a link to Resources. It’s a con-
tinuation of the line above — which should have read Professional
Planning Resources. I guess it’s back to Google for me if I want some
other resources. But wait! You can flip to Appendix C at the back of this
book and find plenty of financial resources. Thank goodness!
Calculators for every occasion
Finding calculators in a financial program is no surprise. Although, just as 
a side note, I find it interesting that the calculator, the 10-key type that you
use to perform math functions like adding and subtracting, is nowhere to 
be found in the Calculators box. (Hint: Look on the Tools menu.) There are,
however, some interesting calculators here in the Calculators box shown in
Figure 1-5, and I think you’ll find these to be quite useful, even if you never
get around to trying out the rest of the financial planning tools that Quicken
has to offer.
The calculators are simple little pop-up boxes that allow you to enter num-
bers in a quick setting, and spit out even quicker responses. Play around
with these calculators anytime you’re contemplating borrowing money,
saving for one of those rainy days, contemplating a college education, or
mulling over your retirement options.

Book VI
Chapter 1
The Quicken
Financial Planner

463
One of the nice features of these calculators is that they allow you the oppor-
tunity to print out a schedule of payments or savings amounts that you can
use to follow along and check your progress on a monthly and yearly basis.
✦Retirement Calculator: More on this in the next chapter. This is the quick
tool for determining how much money you’re going to have to live on
when you retire based on your current rate of savings, or how much you
need to save in order to have what you want to live on when you retire.
✦College Calculator: Experiment with various scenarios to determine how
much you can afford to pay for college, or how much you need to save 
in order to meet your anticipated needs. Start with your current savings,
enter either the total amount you expect college to cost or the total
amount you are able to sock away each month, and let Quicken tell you
whether you’re going to end up in the poor house. For more on college
saving and other college payment options, refer to Chapter 4 of this book.
✦Refinance Calculator: Are you thinking about borrowing money against
your house? Here’s a little calculator that takes the guesswork out of how
much you can borrow and how much you can afford to repay. Read more
about the refinancing process in Chapter 3 of Book IV.
✦Savings Calculator: The savings calculator helps you design a savings
plan for whatever savings goals you are contemplating. Chapter 3 of this
book goes into detail about how to create and manage your savings goals.
This little calculator helps you determine how much you need to save in
order to meet certain goals, or how much money you will have if you save
a certain amount each week, month, quarter, or year. Enter the interest
rate that you earn and Quicken computes the earnings on your savings
as well.
✦Loan Calculator: My personal favorite of the calculator family, the little
loan calculator is never far from my reach. Any time you want, you can
use this calculator to contemplate how much you can afford to borrow,
or how long it will take you to pay back a loan. Determine the difference
in payments based on a change in the interest rate. See examples of the
Loan Calculator in use in Chapter 1 of Book IV. A couple of quick entries,
a click or two, and you’ve got yourself a complete loan schedule, show-
ing all of your payments along with the interest portion of each payment.
Easy, peasy.
Li’l tips from your friends at Quicken
If you like receiving e-mail that is a little more highbrow than spam offers 
to expand certain parts of your anatomy or opportunities to purchase drugs
from Canada, consider subscribing to Quicken’s e-mail newsletters. You 
can choose from Money Matters, a personal financial planning newsletter,
Small Business, for small business owners, and TurboTax, filled with tax 
news and tips.

Getting Familiar with Quicken’s Planning Center
464
These newsletters are written by financial professionals and really do con-
tain useful information. For example, I recently learned that you can click the
little paperclip button on the Transaction tool bar in your register to attach 
a scanned copy of a cancelled check or a receipt. Maybe I can operate in a
paperless office after all!
Go to http://preferencecenter.intuit.com/optin/quicken/, a
sign-up Web page where you enter your name and e-mail address and check
the box for each newsletter that you want to receive. See the sign-up page in
Figure 1-6.
Gettin’ jiggy with Quicken’s business plan
The last tool in the financial planning shed, so to speak, is the little link at
the bottom of the page (Figure 1-7) to Quicken’s offer to Create a Business
Plan. This one is a partial sales pitch. When you take the bait, you’re given a
cash flow calculator to play with. Enter some numbers, slide around on some
slider bars, watch the bars in a graph move up and down, and see how your
cash flow is affected by different circumstances.

Then you’re given an opportunity to buy some software that can help you
organize your business ideas into a formal business plan.
We’re going to talk about business plans and using Quicken to keep track of
your business in Book VIII, so sit tight.
Creating Your Own Financial Plan
As I stated earlier in this chapter, Quicken’s Financial Plan is the same thing
as the Retirement Plan. Now we’re going to experiment with this Planner and
find out just what it can do for us. To avoid confusion, I’m going to refer to
this plan as the Financial Plan — you can call it whatever you like.
All of the Plan Assumptions that appear on the main Planning Center screen
are covered in the actual Financial Plan. After you create your first plan, you
can click on any of the assumptions to make a change. For now, go right into
the Planner, where you answer the questions and enter the information that
enables Quicken to produce a workable plan.
Getting started with the financial plan
It’s easy as pie to start the process of creating your own financial plan in
Quicken — open the Planning Center, and then click the Click Here link in the
Plan: Results section of the screen. If you’ve already fooled around with the
Financial Plan before, the Click Here link might not appear. As an alternative,
you can click the Retirement Planner link in the Planners section on the right
side of the screen. Either way, it’s one click, and away we go!
The Planner appears in a separate window with the Introduction screen dis-
played (Figure 1-8). Some basic tips for making your way through the Planner
are covered here. This Planner is supposed to take about a half an hour to
complete; however, Quicken saves everything you enter, as you enter it, so if
you have to quit the Planner and come back later, no problemo. Just get back
in and pick up where you left off.
Figure 1-7:

Creating Your Own Financial Plan

After you get started, you may notice that there are little check boxes along
the left side of the Planner window. Each area you’ve completed gets a
check, so jumping back into the Planner after a brief hiatus just means that
you need to click on the Retirement Planner over on right side of the screen
in the Planner box, and then click on the first unchecked menu item in the
planner. Presto! You’re ready to pick up where you left off.
After you’ve read the Introduction screen, and from here on whenever you’re
ready to continue, click the Next option to proceed.
For each of the Planner screens, there is a Click Here link that opens a sepa-
rate input window. A Done button returns you to the planner window. The
Next button always takes you to the next item in the Planner menu. After
you’ve entered information on the Planner screens, an Edit option appears
that you can use to get back in and change your information.
It’s all about you
Right after the Financial Planner’s introduction, it’s time to answer some
simple questions about who you are and who else is in your family. Click the
Click Here option on the About You page to open the Quicken Planner: About
You window (Figure 1-9).
Figure 1-8:

Enter your name, birth date, expected age of retirement, and the same infor-
mation for your spouse. If you support any children, or other dependents,
click the New button and enter name and birth date for each dependent.
To determine life expectancy, click the Calculate button after you’ve entered
your age, and the Calculate Life Expectancy window appears (Figure 1-10).
Enter your gender and information about your health. Quicken uses an actu-
arial table to calculate your expected lifespan, and then asks you if you want
to add some years to that calculated amount. Well, who wouldn’t? You are
“allowed” to give yourself up to 10 extra years beyond the age the tables say
you are expected to reach. Enter your own guess at your life expectancy age
in order to continue. Good news — if you come back in 10 years and run the
age expectancy calculation again, you’ll find out you’re going to live even
longer than the original prediction.
Click the appropriate OK and Done buttons to close up these windows, and
you’re back to the Planner and ready to proceed. From now on, when you
open the Planner and look at the About You screen, the personal data you
entered will appear. From now on, there is an Edit button you can click if you
need to make any changes in this information.
Your salary information
Next screen, next question — how much do you earn in a year? Click the
Click Here link to enter salary information. A Salary Income window appears.
You can’t make any entries directly in this window. Click the New button to
open the Add Salary window (Figure 1-11), and then fill in the blanks to enter
salary information, one salary at a time.
Figure 1-9:
Time for

statistics.

468
Enter the date when this salary is expected to begin, or choose Already
Started if this is the salary you already receive.
Quicken assumes your salary increases by a modest 3 percent per year —
you can adjust that percentage up or down depending on your history. And
of course you can keep returning to the salary screen and adding new salary
amounts or new jobs as your life events change.
Answer the rest of the questions about your salary, and then click OK to get
back to the Planner. Keep clicking that New button in the Salary Income
window over and over again until each salary is entered for you and, if you
are married, your spouse.

Entering retirement benefits 
including Social Security
When you click the Click Here link on the Retirement Benefits screen, a
Retirement Benefits window pops up, telling you that you are indeed going
to receive Social Security benefits (what a relief!). Based on the age when
you expect the benefits to begin (assume age 65 for this example) and the
amount of money you earned or will earn in your working life, Quicken tells
you what you can expect in the way of benefits (Figure 1-12).
Click the little Estimate button to call up another box where you choose what
range your average income falls in. You have to pick the range that covers the
highest amount of annual salary you expect to earn in any 10-year period of
your life.
If you don’t have much faith in the federal government being able to make
good on its promises of Social Security benefits, you can ask Quicken to
reduce the projected benefit amount by whatever percent you want. I’ve
chosen to reduce the benefit by 10 percent in Figure 1-12. This is a pure
guessing game here.
If you work for a union or a company that pays pensions, click the little New
button in the Retirement Benefits window to enter any pension benefit you
expect to receive.

Enter miscellaneous income that 
doesn’t fit anywhere else
The Other income line is a catchall for income you receive that doesn’t fit
into the salary and wages, retirement income, business income, investment
income, or income from real estate categories. Suggested income items that
can be reported on the Other income line include child support and alimony,
inheritance money, cash gifts, royalties, and trust fund distributions.
The term income is used a bit loosely here, and what Quicken really wants to
see is any odd amount of money you expect to receive. For example, if you
loaned your brother $1,000 and you expect him to pay it back next year, that
$1,000 should be added to your other income.
From the main Other Income screen, choose Click Here to open a little Other
Income screen, and then click New to open the Add Other Income screen
(Figure 1-13), where you actually are supposed to add this stuff.
Indicate the type of income by clicking one of the options at the left of the
window, and then enter particulars about the income, including how much,
when, and how often you expect to receive it, and your guess at what infla-
tion is going to be in future years.
There’s a field where you are to show the expected tax rate on the income
you entered. This is here for a couple of reasons:
✦The income might not be taxed. If the income is a gift, an inheritance, or
a repayment of a loan, there won’t be any income tax.
Figure 1-13:
Choose a
category 
at the left,
and then
describe
your miscel-
laneous
income.

Book VI
Chapter 1
The Quicken
Financial Planner
Creating Your Own Financial Plan
471
✦The tax rate might be different from your regular income tax rate. For
example, if the amount of income exceeds the amount you’re used to
reporting on your income tax return, the extra income might cause you
to be bumped up to a higher marginal tax rate. Under today’s tax laws,
marginal tax rates go from 10 percent to 35 percent.
You’re also expected to indicate how you expect to use this money, either
for current expenses or as an investment. Quicken gives you an all-or-
nothing choice for the usage of the money. If you expect to use part for cur-
rent expenses and part for investment, you can split the money into two
parts and enter each part separately.
Enter your estimated average tax rate
Estimating your average tax rate is a toughie: No one knows what the tax
rates will be even a few years from now due to Congress’s constant tinkering
with the tax laws. Nevertheless, in order to get this Planner working, Quicken
wants you to enter your estimated marginal tax rate (see Figure 1-14). That’s
easy enough to do today because you can look at your most recent tax
return. As for future planning, well, you have to assume for now that tax
rates aren’t expected to change all that much.
You can figure the tax rate the easy way by choosing the demographic aver-
age. Enter your state, enter your income range (combined income, if you’re
married), and Quicken returns an estimated average income tax rate. After
you see what Quicken has come up with, you can change the amount if you
Figure 1-14:
Take a stab
at guessing
your tax
rate.

Creating Your Own Financial Plan
472
like, but using the demographic average is a quick and easy way to at least
get a close estimate of your income tax.
More guesses: This time, inflation
Excuse me, but Quicken would like you to voice your opinion on how you
expect the nation’s economy to hold up in the years to come. Without even
consulting you, Quicken has assumed that we can expect inflation of 3 per-
cent. If you think that’s reasonable, you’re done with the inflation screen.
Otherwise, click the Click Here link and enter your own percent.
Mary, Mary, quite contrary, 
how will your savings grow?
Quicken gathers up all of your bank accounts and shows you today’s balance
(Figure 1-15). You are to indicate whether you intend to use the money in
this account (or these accounts) as part of your retirement plan or if you
want to exclude the amount from the plan because you plan on spending the
money NOW!
Click New in the top half of the Savings window if there are accounts not
included here that need to be added. Click New in the bottom half of the
Savings window if you plan to make regular contributions to any of your
accounts.
Figure 1-15:

It’s time for investments: How do 
you plan to use this money?
Similar to the Savings screen shown in Figure 1-15, the Investments screen
(Figure 1-16) lists all of the financial investments that you own that have
been recorded in Quicken.
You can show which of the investments you plan on excluding from your
financial plan and which ones you want to keep in the plan.
Click the New button at the bottom of the window to add additional invest-
ments that have not yet been entered in Quicken or that you haven’t
received yet, but expect to in the future. If you add a new investment that
has an existing balance, you have to go into the regular Quicken program to
enter the information about the value of the investment.
Estimating your rate of return
Here’s a really interesting part of the Financial Planner — the Rate of Return
estimator (Figure 1-17). Quicken wants you to say how much, on the average,
you expect to earn each year on your investments.
Guess away, and hope for the best. Check back from time to time and enter
updated information based on the way the economy looks.
If some of your money is invested in tax-free funds or bonds, change the per-
cent at the bottom of the screen to something less than 100 percent.

Asset time
Quicken scrounged around and found your assets from amongst the informa-
tion you already entered. Check over the list (a sample list appears in Fig-
ure 1-18) — make changes where necessary. Add anything that didn’t make 
it onto the list.

Go ahead and open the asset detail window — there’s some interesting stuff
here. Quicken gives you an opportunity to tie any debts you might have to
their associated assets. Click on any asset on the top of the window, and then
click buttons at the bottom of the window to enter or update information
related to the selected asset.
You can associate a loan, expenses, and income with an asset; you can click
the Sale Info button to record an estimate of when and for how much you
expect to sell the asset; and you can click the Exclude from Plan check box 
if this asset is not going to be with you for the long haul.
Are there more homes to come? If you plan on adding a home or other size-
able asset to your stable, the next screen (Figure 1-19) is the place for you.
Maybe you plan on movin’ on up, or maybe you’ll be ready to downsize in a
decade or so. A second car might be in the cards, or maybe that Harley that’s
been calling out to you will finally come home to Papa. Whatever plans you
have for future sizeable purchases, you can click away on the little New button
and add everything you need to make your Financial Plan more accurate and
personal.
But wait! You’re not finished! If you plan on adding a loan to offset the cost of
the future home or other assets, use the Loan button to describe that loan
you think you’ll need.
Loan time
Now we’ve gone over to the flip side of the financial planning equation — debt
to offset all of those assets.
Figure 1-19:

Click on over to Current Loans. Quicken displays a list of any loans you’ve
already entered in your registers, including the start date, the duration, and
the amount of the loan. Not only that, but click once on any loan and at the
bottom of the Loan Accounts window (Figure 1-20), you can see the original
loan amount, your current payment, the interest rate you agreed to, and how
many payments are left.
Click New if you need to add any new loans to your planner. Remember,
these windows don’t just refer to the financial situations you face currently.
If you plan on adding loans in the future (or, as in the last section of this
chapter, a sizeable asset), this is the time to enter a general idea of what and
how much you think you’ll add.
You can always return to the scene of the crime to edit, remove, and add
information so that your planner will be as close to absolutely accurate as
possible.
Don’t forget your debt reduction plan
If you set up a debt reduction plan back in Book II, like I did, Quicken is going
to offer you a chance to incorporate that monthly expense into your finan-
cial plan (Figure 1-21). Jump at the chance, because your plan just isn’t com-
plete unless you include everything.
Figure 1-20:
Don’t forget
your loans.

Book VI
Chapter 1
The Quicken
Financial Planner
Creating Your Own Financial Plan
477
There is a reminder not to duplicate loans in your financial plan. If you’ve
already entered your loans in the Current Loans section of the plan, or if
you’ve introduced the loans in conjunction with the assets that secure the
loans, you need to remove those loans from the debt section, or not include
the monthly debt reduction plan payment in your financial plan.
Likewise, if you have credit card expenses or other expenses that are part of
your debt reduction plan, be sure not to duplicate those expenses later on
here in the Expenses section of your financial plan.
Only one iteration of a loan per customer, please!
Quicken doesn’t let you alter the debt reduction plan payment when you’re
working in the Financial Planner — it’s a case of all or nothing. Or is it? If you
wanted to, you could take the time to set up your debt reduction plan as a
loan, or a current and ongoing expense, and then enter whatever payment
amount you want, making sure you don’t duplicate loan payments already
recorded in the Planner.
Planning on borrowing some money?
If you’re planning on adding a large asset that will have a loan associated
with it, that loan should be added to the Planner when you add the asset,
back in the Homes and Assets section.

But if you’re planning on borrowing for another reason and won’t have a
secured asset affixed to the loan, you need the Future Loans option that
appears on the menu at the left side of the planner. When you click the Here
link, the Planned Loans window appears. There you can enter your future
loan(s) by clicking New and giving up the essential information about the loan:
✦A name for the loan
✦Estimated date of origin
✦Amount borrowed
✦Length of payback time
✦Frequency of payment
After you enter your basic loan information (Figure 1-22), click Next. On 
the next screen, you are asked to enter the projected interest rate. Quicken
calculates what your payment will be and incorporates that payment into
your plan.
Onward to living expenses
You’re nearly finished now — are you closing in on that estimated half an
hour yet? When you get to the Living Expenses portion of your financial
plan, you can go one of two ways. Choose Rough Estimate, and you can then
enter a single amount of how much you expect to spent in general, annually,
on living expenses.
Or, you can choose Category Detail, and Quicken takes you over to a Category
Detail window (Figure 1-23), where you can enter exact amounts in each cate-
gory to reflect what you expect your annual spending is going to be.
Figure 1-22:
Entering
future loans.

When you close the Category Detail window, notice the field at the bottom 
of the Living Expenses window where you can enter the percentage of your
cash surplus that you plan to shift to savings each year.
In the Category Detail window, you can enter a monthly amount for each cat-
egory of expense.
If you choose to use the Category Detail method, you must use this method
for all of your expenses. You can’t enter a rough estimate amount for some of
your expenses and a category detail amount for others.
Planning for life adjustments
Some major factors can play a large part in your financial plan. In the exam-
ple illustrated in Figure 1-24, the couple’s son grows up and moves away
from home. The parents anticipate their living expenses will decrease by 
50 percent when that happens.
Try to think of events that could impact your lifestyle in a significant way,
and adjust your financial plan accordingly. You can add as many of these
lifestyle adjustments as you need. When entering the information for the
change, you are asked to enter a date that the change is expected to occur.
That date can be a function of the age of one of the family members, the
retirement date or the death of a family member, or it can be a specific date.
You also need to indicate a date when the adjustment is expected to end. 
If the adjustment is expected to be permanent, the ending date should be
“Plan End.”

You can choose to increase or decrease living expenses by a specific amount
or by a percentage.
Heading for college
If a family member plans on attending college, and you plan on paying for
that college, you’d better plan on incorporating the costs into your financial
plan. I’ve added a four-year college plan for the son in this sample family.
You can use the College Planner (described in the next chapter of this book)
to get a handle on what your college costs are actually going to be, and then
plug the numbers into the Add College Expense window in the financial plan-
ner (see Figure 1-25).

I estimated $20,000 per year for college costs for my imaginary child. Enter
just one year of cost in the Add College Expense window — Quicken then
calculates the full four-year college plan based on that annual amount.
On the next screen, you have an opportunity to enter anticipated scholarship,
loan, and gift money as well as any portion that the student is expected to con-
tribute (assuming the student is not you).
Then you have a chance to estimate the natural increase in costs that 
occurs with colleges each year. By default, Quicken has estimated a 3 per-
cent increase each year. You can adjust that if you have a better idea of the
rate at which your college expenses are going to increase (it seems the costs
never decrease . . .).
Special expenses: Last but not least
There’s one last category where you can enter other expenses that you didn’t
add in any of the other categories. Examples that are suggested in the finan-
cial planner include wedding expenses (or any big party, like a 50th anniver-
sary, for example) and vacation expenses.
Anything you can think of that is a measurable expense and that wasn’t 
covered in the other categories should be added here, with the date the
expense is supposed to begin, the duration of the expense, and the amount
of the expense.
The plan, unveiled
The next step in your financial plan is to look at the plan results. Quicken
starts by giving you a red or green light to indicate if your plan succeeds or
fails. If the plan fails, it’s time for you to get back into the various screens,
and start making some adjustments that you can live with.
Before you get all excited (either positively or negatively), continue to the
next plan screen to check for problems. A list of issues appears, describing
areas of concern, flat-out mistakes like dates that don’t make sense, hints,
and reminders about areas you might want to examine more closely.
Take some time with the problems list, correcting any errors, fine-tuning the
plan information, and making sure the numbers you are working with are
truly legitimate. If your plan still fails, obviously you need another plan. Maybe
more frugal living is necessary, a second job, retiring later, or continuing with
a part-time job into retirement. Whatever the cure, isn’t it great that you have
some time to plan and figure out how to solve the problems now?

Creating Your Own Financial Plan
482
When you examine your plan, you’ll see an Explore What If’s button (see
Figure 1-26). There’s also a What If menu choice on the left side of your
screen, and another button out on the main Planning Center screen.
Choosing What If gives you a view of your plan along with several What-If
questions you can consider to help bring your plan into line, such as what if
you change your retirement age, what if you sell your home, what if you live
longer, and so on.
Clicking any one of the what-if questions takes you immediately to the window
where you can alter the entries associated with that what if.
The other alternative for dealing with a financial planning dilemma is to go
down the list of assumptions (visible when you open the What If window, or
visible on the main page of the Planning Center). Click any assumption to get
back into the Financial Plan screens where that assumption’s entries were
made. You can see what you entered and also consider other options you
might not have considered the first time around.

Living with your plan
Keep your financial plan by your side and refer to it often — it’s easy to do
with Quicken because from now on you’ll be confronted with the plan each
time you open the Planning Center in Quicken. When a major event (or even
a minor event) in your life changes, or when the stock market improves, or
you get a raise, you change your living arrangements, or whatever, get back
into the Financial Planner and enter the change.
Then take a few minutes to examine the plan itself, the chart, and the Check
for Problems list to see how your changes affect the rest of your planning
ideas. If there are problems, try to figure out what is causing the problems
and how they can be solved. A financial plan problem doesn’t have to be
solved overnight. But developing a workable plan for solving the problem
keeps you in control of your finances.
Making a lifelong financial plan a part of your frequent financial activities can
only make you more savvy when it comes to earning, saving, and spending
your money.

Retirement Savings in Quicken
In This Chapter
 Tracking 401(k) savings
 Tracking IRA savings
 Tracking retirement savings for the self-employed
 Keeping tabs on your Social Security
You know as well as I do that you don’t really need to keep track of 
your retirement savings. All this nonsense about 401(k) plans and IRA
accounts and other methods of using numbers and letters to signify savings
accounts is part of a great plot to keep accountants and IRS agents employed
and off the streets at night. If we really needed to save money for retirement,
the government or our parents or our school teachers or our bosses would
have told us to start saving, right? Oh wait a minute. I think they did tell us
to do that . . .
Watching Over Your 401(k)
The most popular retirement plan around, after Social Security, is the 401(k)
plan. Most employers offer a 401(k) plan to their employees. Those plans
sometimes include attractive matching programs whereby employees are
rewarded for saving money in their 401(k) plans by having their employer
make additional plan contributions.
You can choose not to keep an eye on your 401(k) plan, arguing that (a) your
employer already prepares reports for you and tracks your investments so
you don’t have to, (b) it’s too much trouble because the amounts are invested
in different securities and with every paycheck the investment totals change,
or (c) you’ll get around to it someday but not today, thank you. And that’s
fine if that’s the way you feel.
But this is your retirement I’m talking about: It’s the money that’s going to
get you through the long years of sleeping late, watching Seinfeld reruns,
and playing Sudoku. Don’t you want to at least have an idea of how much
money is going to be available for all that fun?

Watching Over Your 401(k)
486
You can be a zealot about monitoring your 401(k) in Quicken, entering every
paycheck’s contribution into the appropriate funds, or you can let the plan
administrator do that work for you and take on more of an observer’s role.
But no matter which approach you like, I strongly recommend you keep at
least one eye on your money. It might seem like this is your employer’s
investment and your only involvement is filing the reports in a drawer each
quarter, but that attitude is completely wrong. This is your investment, and
you should be completely aware of how much is invested on your behalf,
how much those investments are earning, and what kind of return you can
expect when you start withdrawing money from the fund.
Basic rules for 401(k) plans
Each company has its own rules and stipulations about the 401(k) plan that
is offered to employees, so one company’s 401(k) plan is not the same as
another plan. The rules set out here are general guidelines, but you should
speak with the plan administrator at your company if you want to fully under-
stand the characteristics of your company’s plan.
That said, the 401(k) plan is a tax-deferred retirement plan in which you can
contribute money that is excluded from your income tax in the year of the
contribution. This gives you the double benefit of being able to save for 
your retirement and cut taxes at the same time. Your employer might offer a
matching contribution plan, which means that the more you contribute, the
more the company adds to the plan.
There’s a limit to how much you can contribute to the plan, and that limit is
a function of the whims of Congress combined with how much money you
earn, and is subject to additional limits imposed by your employer. For 2006,
the most you can contribute to a 401(k) plan is $15,000, but your employer
might have other rules that lower that amount. Your employer can advise
you how much you can actually contribute.
Contribute means that you agree to have a certain amount of money taken out
of your pay and deposited in one or more investments that your company
makes available to you for your 401(k) fund. Unlike the old-fashioned company
pension plan, the 401(k) is your money, and it’s there for you no matter what,
unless of course you worked for Enron, but that’s another story.
Actually Enron’s not another story, and we should at least address that situa-
tion here. The problem with Enron’s 401(k) plan was that employees were
required to invest part of their 401(k) money into Enron company stock (all
employer matching contributions were made only in company stock), and
when the company went belly-up, well, so did the value of the stock and thus
the 401(k) investments. The moral of this story is that a little diversification
can save the day.

Back to the basic rules:
✦Money you put in your 401(k) reduces your taxable income in the year of
the contribution and thus reduces your income tax in that year as well.
✦Earnings in the plan accumulate, without being taxed, until you remove
the money from the plan. When you start withdrawing money, that is
when the tax begins.
✦As long as you work for the employer who administers the 401(k) plan,
you can’t withdraw the 401(k) money, except in the case of an emergency
or by taking out a loan — these situations are described in the next 
sections.
✦There is an annual limit of how much you can contribute to the plan. In
addition to the statutory limit, there is an additional amount that tax-
payers over age 50 can contribute. Contribution limits are a function of
the statutory limit, an allowable percentage of your salary, and addi-
tional limits set by your employer.
✦When you leave your job, the 401(k) plan is yours to take if you want it.
In some circumstances, you can leave the money with your employer, roll
it over to a new 401(k) plan with a different employer, or roll it over to
an IRA that you control yourself.
✦At any time, if you withdraw money from your 401(k) plan, the money is
subject to federal income tax. Depending on where you live, the money
might also be subject to state income tax. The exception to this rule is
for money that is borrowed from the 401(k) plan.
401(k) and the IRS
The whole point of a 401(k) plan is to save money for retirement, so digging
into the money before you retire kind of defeats the purpose of the plan. 
To discourage people from taking the money, the IRS imposes the hefty 
10 percent penalty in addition to charging income tax on the total amount 
withdrawn.
✦When you turn age 591⁄2, the 401(k) money is yours to take without
penalty. You can roll the money into an IRA and let the money continue
to grow while deferring the tax on the earnings, or you can leave the
money where it is and withdraw funds as you need them.
✦When you turn age 701⁄2, it’s time to get serious about taking money out
of your 401(k). The IRS, after all, has been waiting patiently to collect
income tax on all of that money sitting in tax-deferred retirement funds.
When you hit the magic age of 701⁄2, you are required to begin withdraw-
ing (and paying tax on) a minimum amount each year. The minimum
withdrawal amount is determined based on your life expectancy, and
your life expectancy is determined by the tables produced by the IRS
(scary thought that the IRS is making bets on my life expectancy).

Watching Over Your 401(k)
488
✦When you die, any amounts remaining in your 401(k) plan are turned
over to whomever you named as your beneficiary. That person can
choose to leave the money in the plan for a certain number of years
(there are more IRS tables to tell the beneficiary how long the plan can
remain intact). Eventually, whenever the beneficiary takes the money
out of the plan, taxes will be due.
When you set up your 401(k) plan, you were probably required to name a
beneficiary. You might have that 401(k) plan for 40 years or more — during
that time period it’s possible that you might change your mind about who is
to inherit your money when you die. If you do have a change of heart, you
need to contact the 401(k) plan administrator and change that beneficiary.
Taking money out of your 401(k) before retirement
The money in your 401(k) is your money, but the IRS attempts to discourage
the temptation to withdraw this money by allowing you to defer the income
tax on your investment.
Technically, as long as you are employed, you are not allowed to take the
money out of your 401(k) plan. However, there are some exceptions to this
rule. The IRS defines four hardship situations that justify withdrawing money
from the 401(k). Note that if you take money from the plan, you are required
to report that money as income on your tax return and pay income tax on
the money. In addition, you are probably going to be liable for a 10 percent
penalty on the early withdrawal of the money. But see “Skipping out on the
401(k) penalty” sidebar later for suggestions for how you can avoid this
penalty.
The IRS defines these four circumstances as hardships worthy of a withdrawal
from your 401(k) plan:
✦College tuition: College costs, including tuition, fees, and room and board
paid for yourself, your spouse, or your dependents qualifies as a hard-
ship. You must provide documentation of the college fees in order to
take the money out of your 401(k), and the fees must be due and payable
to the college within 12 months of the date on which you withdraw the
money.
✦Down payment on purchase of primary residence: You can withdraw
401(k) money to use as a down payment on the purchase of a home that
is to be your primary residence. You have to provide copies of the settle-
ment papers showing the down payment amount, and you have to pro-
vide evidence of your inability to obtain financing elsewhere.
✦Medical expenses: The expenses must be for yourself, your spouse, or
your dependents, and they must be expenses that are not reimbursable
by insurance. You must provide copies of the medical bills and evidence
of the fact that they are not covered by insurance.

Chapter 2

Watching Over Your 401(k)
489
✦Preventing foreclosure: If your primary residence is under a threat of
foreclosure or you are being threatened with eviction, you can take money
from your 401(k) to keep the lien-holder at bay. You must provide evi-
dence of the foreclosure or eviction proceedings.
You are not allowed to exercise the hardship options for taking money from
your 401(k) if you are eligible to take a loan from the plan — instead, you
must borrow from the plan. You also must have exhausted all other reason-
able resources for borrowing or obtaining money before you can take the
money from your 401(k). You also must sign a document attesting to your
hardship need and your efforts to obtain financing elsewhere.
Borrowing from your 401(k): Danger, 
Will Robinson! Danger!
As the owner of a 401(k) plan, you might have the right to borrow money
from the plan. The terms of the plan dictate the rights to borrowing, so read
the material that you received when you signed up for the plan to find out if
you can borrow money. If your plan does permit borrowing, there might be
restrictions that you need to consider. Some plans only allow borrowing for
the hardship scenarios listed in the previous section.
If you can’t find the documentation that came with your 401(k) plan, you 
can always ask the plan administrator at your company what the borrowing
options are.
There are positive and negative elements to borrowing from your 401(k)
plan. Because the money is supposed to be protected and saved for your
retirement, there are long-term planning issues to consider before taking
money from the plan. Here’s a quick look at both the upside and the down-
side of 401(k) borrowing.
Skipping out on the 401(k) penalty
You can avoid the 10 percent penalty for early
withdrawal from your 401(k) if one of these cir-
cumstances exists:
 You are paying medical bills that exceed 7.5
percent of your income.
 You are disabled (see your plan’s definition
of disabled before assuming you qualify).
 You are at least 56 years old.
 You are the spouse of the employee that
owns the plan and you are getting a divorce.

Watching Over Your 401(k)

Potential problems and other reasons not to borrow from your 401(k):
✦You temporarily lose the earning power and the compounding power of
the money that is removed from the fund.
✦Depending on employer rules, you might lose the ability to continue
making contributions while the loan is outstanding, and thus also lose
any matching contributions that the employer would have made, and of
course you lose the interest and compounding from those monies.
✦If you miss a payment, if you’re fired or decide to quit your job, or if the
company shuts down, the plan administrator has the right to recall your
loan in total, immediately and without warning.
✦If you fail to repay loan, the money is subject to income tax and 10 per-
cent penalty.
✦The loan must be repaid within five years (there is an exception to this
rule if the money is used for a home loan).
Advantages to borrowing from your 401(k):
✦It’s easy. There’s no loan application, no waiting for approval. It’s your
money and you have the right to take it. If your plan permits loans, you
can borrow up to 50 percent of your vested balance (up to a maximum
of $50,000).
✦Did I mention that 401(k) borrowing is easy? I mean really easy. You can
probably request the money online, and then whammo! The check’s in
the mail.
✦The interest rate is low. At least on the surface. When you figure in the
loss of earning power and the loss of compounding power that you’re
giving up while the money is out of the 401(k) fund, the low interest rate
might not be such a good deal.
✦You’ve got up to five years to repay the loan (as long as you keep making
timely monthly or quarterly payments), and longer if the money is used
for a down payment on a home purchase.
Taking money out of your 401(k) is a costly decision. Just look at Table 2-1
below to see how a withdrawal or a loan from your 401(k) affects you in the
long run.
Example: You’re 40 years old. You have $40,000 saved in your 401(k). You’re in
the 25 percent marginal tax bracket. You decide you want to withdraw $15,000
to pay for your son’s college costs. If you borrow the money, you will pay it
back over five years. If you withdraw the money, you also withdraw enough 
to pay for the tax and penalty so that you still have $15,000 to pay for college.
The monthly payments of $290 represent the minimum payment necessary for
repayment of the loan, assuming a 6 percent interest rate. In the loan example,

Book VI
Chapter 2
Tracking Your
Retirement Savings
in Quicken
Watching Over Your 401(k)
491
the first five years of payments go toward repaying the loan, and then monthly
contributions of $290 continue after five years. In the withdraw and leave
alone examples, the monthly payment amount of $290 continues for 10 years.

This is expensive money!
Leaving your job
When you leave your job, you need to think seriously about what you plan 
to do with your 401(k) plan. The temptation might be to cash out; indeed, if
you’re leaving your job without another job waiting in the wings, that temp-
tation might be pretty irresistible.
Cashing out of your 401(k) plan before you reach the retirement age is an
expensive venture, considering the income tax and the 10 percent penalty.
Make sure you are fully informed of your 401(k) options when you leave your
job before simply taking the money out of the plan. Here are some options to
consider (your company might have additional options as well):
✦Leave the money in the plan. Check with your employer to see if you can
leave your money in the company plan. If your balance is high enough,
the employer is required to let you continue to participate in the plan,
even if you are no longer employed at that company.
✦Roll over the entire balance of your 401(k) into an IRA that you manage
yourself.
✦Roll over the entire balance of your 401(k) into a 401(k) sponsored by
your next employer.

Watching Over Your 401(k)
492
✦Take a portion of the 401(k) account balance out in cash, and roll over
the remaining balance into an IRA or another employer-sponsored plan.
✦Take the entire 401(k) balance in cash and pay the tax and penalty.
When you leave the job, you are given some paperwork and forms to fill out
regarding the treatment of your 401(k) plan balance. Read the paperwork
carefully, and discuss your options with the plan administrator to make sure
you understand what the ramifications are.
Keeping track of your 401(k)
Typically, your 401(k) plan is arranged with a collection of mutual funds from
which you can choose your investment mix. How you make that choice is
totally up to you, but the more informed you are about the funds, by reading
stock reports and keeping up on analyst comments, the easier it will be to
choose. Also, the longer you are a participant in the funds, the more first-
hand experience you will have and the more intelligently you should be able
to judge the performance of your investments.
As I mentioned earlier, you can go the extra mile, as it were, and enter each 
of your paycheck 401(k) contributions in the funds that you track in Quicken,
monitoring how each investment is split among the different funds and track-
ing how these funds are performing. But chances are, your 401(k) plan advi-
sor is already doing this for you. Most 401(k) plans are accessible over the
Internet, so you can go to the Web site as frequently as you like, log in, and see
how your funds are doing.
You still need to account for the money somehow in Quicken, setting up a
place where your 401(k) contributions are recorded. Here’s how the initial
setup of a 401(k) plan works:
1. Start a new account in Quicken.
Press Ctrl+A to open the Account List, and then click Add Account to
open the Quicken Account Setup window.
2. Enter the name of the bank or brokerage or 401(k) plan administrator
in the first field, and then click Next.
As soon as you begin typing, Quicken displays a list of all of the banks
that have set up partner relationships to provide online access with
Quicken. Choose from the list, or enter the name of your financial insti-
tution even if it does not appear on the list. If you want to take advan-
tage of online updates to your 401(k) account, you must place your
investments with a Quicken partner.
3. Choose whether you want online or manual setup.

If your financial institution does not provide automatic transfer of data
to Quicken, you won’t see this question. If automatic transfer is an
option and you want Quicken to set up your account automatically by
going online and transferring data from the financial institution you indi-
cated in step 2, choose the online option. If you prefer to enter informa-
tion about your 401(k) investments manually, choose the Manual option.
4. Indicate that the plan is a 401(k) plan (see Figure 2-1).
5. Give the account a name to distinguish this account from any other
account you’ve set up in Quicken, and then click Next.
6. Enter some more information about the account, such as the date 
of your last statement, the name of your employer, whether you are
still employed by this employer, and whether your statement shows
the number of shares of each fund you own (Figure 2-2), and then
click Next.
7. If you have any loans against the account, enter Yes when asked, 
and then you will be asked to enter the original loan amount and 
the remaining balance. Click Next after filling in the loan fields.
8. Enter the name and the ticker symbol for each fund you have 
invested in.
If you don’t know the ticker symbol, you can click the little Ticker Symbol
Lookup button at the bottom of the list and enter the fund name. Quicken
lets you know the ticker symbol. Information about the funds you’ve
chosen for your investment is available on your 401(k) statement. Click
Next after you’ve entered all your ticker symbols and Quicken accesses
the Internet and determines the exact names of the funds that match
those symbols.
Figure 2-1:

9. Enter the quantity of shares you own.
For each fund in which you have an investment, enter the number of
shares you own (Figure 2-3). This information can be found on your
most recent statement, or on your 401(k) plan’s Web site. Also, if the
information is available, enter the total market value of your investment.
10. When you click Next, your account is included with your Quicken file

for more information about setting up an account for online services. After
you have established the online relationship, the 401(k) becomes part of
your regular online update procedure.
If you don’t have your 401(k) set up for online services within Quicken, you
can easily update your Quicken account at any time by referring to your
401(k) account statement. In addition to providing paper statements, many
401(k) plans let you obtain account information from their Web site. Check
with your plan administrator for access to Internet updates on your account.
To update your 401(k) account information by hand, follow these steps:
1. Display your 401(k) account in Quicken.
Click on the account name over on the Account Bar at the left side of
your screen, or press Ctrl+A and then double-click on the account name
to display the screens that relate to this account.
2. Display either the Summary or the Transactions tab for your 401(k)
account, and then click the Update 401(k) Holdings button that appears
at the top of the account screen.
3. Enter the date of your most recent statement, or the most recent view-
ing of your accounts online.
4. Answer the questions regarding the display of the number of shares
on your statement and whether you took out a loan since your last
statement.
5. Enter the amount of your own contributions, your employer matching
contributions, and any other contributions made since your last state-
ment, including loan repayments, or rollover amounts from another
account (see Figure 2-4).

How to get an IRA
Going out and getting an IRA is easier than you might think. In fact, you can
remove the “going out” part of that sentence because you don’t even have to
leave home to open an IRA account.
First, choose a financial institution, brokerage, or even a single mutual fund
that you want to use for your IRA. This is completely your own choice. The
IRA isn’t run by your employer — this is your own personal savings account
that just happens to get special tax treatment.
You can research mutual funds on the Internet at www.morningstar.com
to read about the funds and get ratings. (Morningstar has a 5-star rating
service that it applies to mutual funds, judging not only fund performance
but such factors as diversification, qualifications of the management team,
and more.)
If you want to manage your own account, mutual funds let you open an IRA
by contacting the fund directly so you don’t have to go through a broker.
Many banks and brokerage houses also offer their own IRA funds, or will pur-
chase shares in mutual funds for you.
You can contact a mutual fund (or bank or brokerage) and ask to have an IRA
application mailed to you. Then fill out the application, sign it, and send it in
with your check, and you’re good to go.
After you’ve established an IRA, you can ask your employer to set up a direct
deposit to your IRA, sending a portion of your paycheck directly to your IRA
each pay period.
Another alternative for making mindless deposits to your IRA is to set up an
automatic payment from your bank account to the IRA. In doing this, you
authorize the IRA to take the money out of your account each month (or
however frequently you like).
Or, instead of letting your employer or your IRA fund take the money, you
can set up automatic payments in Quicken! That way, if you have an emer-
gency and can’t make the IRA deposit on a particular date, you can circum-
vent the automatic payment in your Quicken account.

Setting up your IRA in Quicken
Set your IRA account in Quicken so that you can monitor the growth and
easily transfer money into your account. Here are the easy steps for setting
up your IRA:
1. Open the Account Setup window.
Press Ctrl+A to open the Account List, and then click the Add Account
option at the top of the list. The Account Setup window appears.
2. Enter the name of the bank or brokerage firm you use for your IRA,
and then on the next screen, enter the information about that bank or
broker.
If you have set up your IRA directly with a mutual fund, click the option
indicating that the account is not held at a financial institution.
3. Choose IRA, SEP, Keogh for the type of account (see Figure 2-8).
4. Give the IRA a name.
Fluffy or Spot come to mind. Or you could call your IRA something sensi-
ble, like Gail’s IRA, or Fidelity IRA. Just humor Quicken on this and give
the account a name.
5. Indicate who owns this IRA, and then choose the IRA type.
Click the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-9, and pick out which 
type of IRA you own. Most IRAs are traditional, meaning they qualify 
for deferred tax treatment and there is the possibility of making tax-
deductible contributions. But maybe you have a Roth, or an Education
IRA, or one of the others. Pick your IRA and move on.
Figure 2-8:
Indicate the

6. Enter the statement information.
Enter the date of your last statement, the amount of money that is being
held in cash, and the amount of money that is being held in a mutual
fund. If this is a new IRA, these amounts will be zero, or just the amount
of your initial deposit.
7. Enter the ticker symbols for the fund (or funds) in which you’re
investing your IRA money. If you don’t know the ticker symbol, 
click the Ticker Symbol Lookup button at the bottom of the screen
(see Figure 2-10), enter the fund name, and Quicken seeks out the
symbol for you.
8. Enter the number of shares you own.
9. Confirm the information on the Summary screen that appears, and
then click Done to enter the IRA information in Quicken.

Making IRA contributions
When you make contributions to your IRA, enter the contribution in your
bank account register, just as you would enter a bill payment. The Payee is
the name of the fund that is receiving the cash, and the category is your IRA
account. When you use your IRA account as the category, Quicken automati-
cally enters a corresponding transaction in the register for your IRA account.
Timing your IRA contributions
Should you make your IRA contributions at the beginning of the year, or at
the end of the year? The answer you get depends on what results you want
to achieve. If you want to have your IRA money busy working for you,
increasing as much as possible and taking advantage of that tax-deferral on
the earnings, by all means, get your money into the IRA as early as possible.
It just makes sense. The longer your money is in the account, the longer it
has to increase in value.
Personally, I like to make IRA contributions monthly, a little at a time, instead
of waiting until one point in the year and making the entire annual contribu-
tion all at once. The little-at-a-time method is easier on the budget, even it if
does mean you relinquish use of some of your cash throughout the year.
On the other hand, if you need the use of that money during the year and
want to wait until the end of the year to make your IRA contribution (or even
until next spring — see the Remember below), it makes sense to hang on to
the cash and use it as you need to during the year.
It’s your call — determine your priorities for the money, either more earn-
ing power or more useful cash-on-hand — and then make your IRA deposits
accordingly.
You have until April 15 of the year after the tax year to make your IRA contri-
butions and still get a deduction on your tax return. But waiting until next
April 15 means you’ve lost more than a year of earning power on the money
you could have contributed last year.
Taking money out of your IRA before you retire
The IRA is your money, so why can’t you just take the money out and use it
whenever you like? Technically, you can do just that. Unlike the 401(k), which
has some pretty stringent restrictions on getting money out of the account,
the IRA is your account, administered by you, and thus you make the rules, at
least in terms of when you can take money out.
Just make sure you understand the consequences of pulling money out of
your IRA before you write that check or request a withdrawal from your
broker or from the mutual fund administrator.

Individual Retirement Accounts
502
✦Any money withdrawn from your IRA is subject to income tax, to the
extent that the money has not previously been taxed. All of the fund’s
earnings are in the category of having not been previously taxed. As for
money you contributed to the fund, if you took a tax deduction for the
contributions, that money has not yet been taxed and will be taxed when
you withdraw it. If you didn’t take a tax deduction when you contributed
the money to the IRA, you don’t have to pay tax on the money when it is
withdrawn.
✦Any money withdrawn from your IRA before you reach age 591⁄2 is subject
to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty, in addition to the income tax,
unless the money is used for one of the emergency situations listed below.
If you withdraw IRA money and you use that money specifically for one of
these situations, you can avoid the 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal:
✦Return of your IRA contribution in the same year you made the 
contribution.
✦Medical expenditures that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross
income.
✦Medical insurance, if you are out of work and receiving unemployment
compensation for at least 12 consecutive weeks.
✦Higher education expenses, including tuition, books, fees, supplies, and
equipment for you, your spouse, your child, or your grandchild attend-
ing post-secondary (that is, after high school) school.
✦Costs associated with the purchase of a home, for first-time homebuyers
only. These costs can include acquisition costs, settlement charges, and
closing costs.
I don’t know what planet the Congress was on when it made up the definition
for “first-time homebuyers”: In order to be considered a first-time home-
buyer, you have to have not owned a principal residence for the past two
years.
You can also take money out of your IRA for non-emergency use — you don’t
even have to have a reason. Just keep in mind that you pay federal income
tax, maybe state income tax (depends on what state you live in), 10 percent
early withdrawal penalty, plus you lose the earnings that that money would
have accumulated in your IRA fund.
Taking money out of your IRA after you retire
This is what the IRA is really all about: Instead of dipping into the IRA when-
ever you get tight on cash, you’re supposed to leave the money alone until

Book VI
Chapter 2
Tracking Your
Retirement Savings
in Quicken
Individual Retirement Accounts
503
you reach age 591⁄2, when you can take the money out without having to pay
that pesky penalty.
In fact, you can even leave the money in your IRA longer, until you reach age
701⁄2, before you are actually required to start making withdrawals.
The first mandatory withdrawal from your IRA actually comes in the year after
you turn 701⁄2. Specifically, you are required to take your first withdrawal by
April 1 of the year after the year in which you turn 701⁄2. So if your 70th birth-
day is on August 1, 2006, you’ll turn 701⁄2 in 2007; therefore, your first manda-
tory IRA withdrawal must be made by April 1, 2008.
When you begin withdrawing from your IRA, you can choose between with-
drawing the entire balance or receiving periodic distributions. You make this
choice on the date on which your distributions begin. You do, however, still
have the option of withdrawing your entire balance even after making peri-
odic distributions.
The IRA mandatory withdrawal rules apply to traditional IRAs, not Roth IRAs.
You are not required to ever withdraw the money from your Roth IRA.
As for figuring out your life expectancy, you might think you’re going to 
live until you reach 110, but the IRS has different plans for you. The IRS pub-
lishes its life expectancy tables in Publication 590, Individual Retirement
Arrangements. You can find this publication on the Internet at the IRS Web
site, www.irs.gov, and the life expectancy tables are found in the back of
the publication, under “It’s about time we got our hands on the tax for all of
this IRA money,” or some similar title.
Here’s the way the tables work: You find your age today, and then the IRS
tells you how many years you have left to live (consider having a stiff drink
or two before opening up these tables). You take the amount in your IRA
account (or accounts — add them all together if you have more than one
account), and divide by the number of years you have left to live, and that’s
the minimum amount of how much money you are supposed to withdraw
each year from your IRA. Feel free to take more than the minimum — the more
you withdraw, the more tax the IRS gets, and that makes the IRS very happy.
Calculating the minimum IRA distribution
Typically, an annual distribution from your IRA
is determined by dividing the entire balance 
in all of your IRA accounts as of December 31 
of the preceding year, by your remaining life
expectancy.

Social Security
504
Your required IRA distribution can be made in one annual withdrawal, or you
can set up regular quarterly or monthly installments.
Social Security
Social Security, the nation’s government-provided retirement welfare pro-
gram, is available to anyone who worked for at least 10 years in his or her
life. Depending on when you were born, you have to be somewhere from 65
years old to 67 years old before you are eligible to start receiving benefits.
You can actually start receiving benefits at age 62, but then you don’t receive
as much money as you do if you can hold on for a few more years until you
get to 65–67 age bracket.
The amount you receive is not arbitrary — there are official tables where
you can calculate your retirement benefit, or you can write to the Social
Security Administration and ask for a statement of how much you’ve earned
over the years and how much you can anticipate for your monthly benefit.
Go to the Social Security Administration’s Web site to find the benefits calcu-
lators, at www.ssa.gov/planners/calculators.htm. Or you can fill out
Form SSA-7004, Request for Social Security Statement, and mail the form to
this address:
Social Security Administration
Wilkes-Barre Data Operations Center
P.O. Box 7004
Wilkes-Barre, PA 18767-7004
Download a copy of Form SSA-7004 at www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-7004.

What to do when it’s time to 
start receiving benefits
When you think you’re old, wise, or cantanker-
ous enough to start receiving Social Security
benefits, you can go to the Social Security
Administration’s Web site and access the appli-
cation information online. Go to www.social
security.gov/applytoretire to apply
for benefits online.
Alternatively, you can call the SSA at 800-772-
1213 and tell them that you’re ready to apply for
benefits.

Social Security

Depending on your income level, your Social Security benefits might be tax-
able. It might not make sense at first, when you consider the fact that you
pay tax on the Social Security money when the money gets withheld from
your paycheck. But that’s only half the story. Your employer pays for half of
your Social Security benefits, and that money has not yet been taxed; there-
fore, the IRS wants you to pay tax on up to half of the benefits you receive.
There’s a worksheet in the tax return instructions that you can use for figur-
ing out how much of your Social Security income is going to be taxed. Here’s
a link to a copy of the instructions containing that worksheet:
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040.pdf
The Social Security benefits you receive are based on the average monthly
earnings during the 35 years in which you earned the most. Then a secret for-
mula is applied to the average in order to come up with your actual earnings.
This Social Security information is all about you and the retirement benefits
that you are eligible to receive based on your lifetime earnings. Other types
of Social Security benefits such as survivor benefits and disability benefits
are not addressed here.
Special rules for self-employed
Self-employed people have all the luck. Not
only do they get to pay Social Security benefits
like most of the rest of the nation’s employees
(except certain government workers and mem-
bers of the clergy), but they also get to pay 
that much again because they don’t have an
employer to pay the extra share for them.
Employees who work at a job pay half of their
Social Security, and the federal government
requires their employers to pay the other half. It
make sense, then, that if you’re self-employed,
there’s no employer to pick up the slack with
the other half of Social Security, so you get to
pay the full amount yourself.
This is one of the great surprises that greet
newly self-employed people who didn’t do their
tax research before going off on their own to
launch a new business.
There is a silver lining (or at least a partially
silver-tinted lining) for those self-employed indi-
viduals who have to fork over twice the Social
Security tax. The IRS lets them take a deduction
on their income tax return for one half of the
Social Security tax paid. Just like a normal
employer who gets to deduct his employees’
Social Security tax on his business tax return,
the self-employed person gets essentially the
same treatment. It’s not a great reduction in
income tax, but it’s a start.

lthough some routine expenses come out of your monthly budget like
clockwork and other large expenses like retirement seem miles away in
the distance, another type of expense falls somewhere in between in terms
of time and size. (Think of saving to buy a car or pay for a wedding.) Such
special events — or special purpose expenses in Quicken’s worldview —
require dedicated savings, perhaps over a specified time frame. You could
modify your overall budget for special savings goals, but Quicken offers
other tools that help you more effectively zero in on and plan for a particular
special savings goal. You can set up a savings goal and contribute toward
that goal in the Savings Goals Planner, or you can use the Special Purchase
Planner. This chapter shows you how either of these tools can help you set
aside the dollars you need to make a major purchase or fund a major event.
Savings Goals and Why You Want Them
It may be true that you can’t always get what you want, but you can get a
heckuva lot closer to having the cash you need to pay for a car, a vacation, a
computer, or anything else you want if you set aside money for the purchase
on a routine basis.
Quicken includes the Savings Goals Planner to help you save a particular
amount of money by a particular date. You create a savings goal in the
Savings Goals Planner to specify the goal amount and date. You then make
contributions to the goal using the Savings Goal Planner.

Setting Up a Savings Goal
508
Although setting a goal may still seem like an abstract exercise, the Savings
Goals Planner can help you punch up your savings performance in a few dif-
ferent ways:
✦Financial and life coaches say that recording a goal is a powerful psycho-
logical tool in helping you target your actions to meet that goal. Setting
up a savings goal in Quicken creates a real target that you can aim for.
✦Quicken actually sets up a special asset account called a savings goal
account to track your progress in reaching the savings goal. Although the
savings goal account doesn’t represent a real-life bank account, it does
represent an area in Quicken where the funds you’ve contributed towards
your savings goal are set aside.
✦The ability to go back and track your progress towards a savings goal
also motivates you to continue. When you see how far you’ve come, 
getting the rest of the way to your goal seems a whole lot easier.
✦Based on the amount of time until the savings goal is to be reached,
Quicken calculates how large your current monthly contribution needs
to be if you want to get there in time. This specific guidance helps you
contribute enough, or ramp up your contributions if you’ve fallen short
earlier in your savings progress.
✦Finally — and this is the big one — the Savings Goals Planner basically
tricks you into reaching your savings goal. Each contribution you make
towards the savings goal is recorded in the register as a transfer out of
the cash flow (bank) account into the savings goal account. The money
that was “transferred” really remains in the cash flow account, but the
balance for the account factors in the transfers for the savings goal and
is therefore lower. This helps you avoid spending dollars you’ve other-
wise set aside for the savings goal.
You can still view the actual balance in the cash flow account as described in
the later section called “Making Payments to Your Savings Goal.”
Setting Up a Savings Goal
Like many of the other tools you’ve used so far in Quicken, the Savings Goals
Planner appears in its own window. You can use the Savings Goals Planner to
set up, contribute to, and view your progress toward as many savings goals
as you need to pursue in your life. To create a savings goal, you need to know
the amount you want to save and the date by which you need to save it.
In some cases, you may need to do a little research to come up with the target
amount for the savings goal. For example, if you’re saving to buy a car (hope-
fully a used car, if you’re a prudent spender), you should do some research

Book VI
Chapter 3
Savings Goals
Setting Up a Savings Goal
509
about how much the particular make/model/condition of the car you want
costs. Similarly, if you’re saving for a wedding or vacation, you have to price
out the actual costs to have a realistic target rather than just picking a number
out of the air.
Chapter 1 of this book discusses Quicken’s various planners and how they
can be used to help you determine how much something costs.
To open the Savings Goal Planner, choose Planning➪Savings Goals from the
menu bar in the main Quicken window. The Savings Goals window opens
onscreen as shown in Figure 3-1. Any previously created savings goals
appear in the Goal Name list that fills up much of the window.
To set up a new savings goal, follow these steps:
1. Open the Create New Savings Goal dialog box.
You’ve already opened the Savings Goals window. Now click the New
choice at the top of the window, and the Create New Savings Goal dialog
box appears.
2. Enter a name for the savings goal in the Goal Name text box.
3. Enter the savings goal amount in the Goal Amount text box.

4. Enter the target date in the Finish Date text box.
Figure 3-2 shows example settings for a new savings goal.
5. When you’ve entered the goal information, click OK to add the goal to
the Goal Name list in the Savings Goal Planner.
That’s all there is to it!
You can use the calculator button beside the Goal Amount text box or the
calendar button beside the Finish Date text box to help you calculate or
select your entry for either of those text boxes, respectively.
As with in any Quicken window, to close the Savings Goals window, click 
the X in the upper-right corner of the window. To reopen the window at any
later time, choose Planning➪Savings Goals from the main Quicken window
menu bar.
Making Payments to Your Savings Goal
When you want to set aside money towards a savings goal, you make a con-
tribution to the savings goal in the Savings Goals Planner.
The schedule for allocating money towards your savings goal remains com-
pletely up to you. For purposes of helping you get to your goal on time,
Quicken assumes that you will be making monthly contributions. But you
can make contributions as infrequently or frequently as you want.
That being said, the savings goals work best if you strive to hold yourself to
some type of schedule or frequency for making contributions. For example,
if you like to set aside smaller contributions on a weekly basis to keep the
motivational juices flowing, set aside some time every weekend to open 
the Savings Goal Planner and make your contribution. In other cases, your
contributions might tie together more disciplined financial behavior to some
reward. For example, if you’ve set up a savings goal to treat yourself to a spa
Figure 3-2:

a name,
amount, 
and target
date for
your goal.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Savings Goals

511
visit as a reward for cutting back on pricey lattes, you could contribute $10
to your savings goal for every five lattes you skip.
Perhaps the easiest way to schedule contributions to your savings goal is 
to coordinate your contributions with the days on which you receive your
paychecks.
When you’re ready to make a contribution to your savings goal, all you need
to know is the name of the savings goal and the account that holds the funds
you want to apply to the goal. Then take these steps to make the contribution:
1. Open the Savings Goals Planner window by choosing Planning➪
Savings Goals from the Quicken menu.
2. Click the savings goal towards which you want to make a contribution
in the Goal Name list.
3. Click the Contribute choice near the top of the Savings Goals Planner
window.
The Contribute To Goal dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
4. Choose the account that has the funds to contribute (set aside) from
the From Account drop-down list.
This is called the source account.
5. Specify the contribution date in the Date text box.
6. If needed, edit the amount to contribute in the Amount text box.
The value that automatically appears in the Amount text box represents
the monthly contribution you need to make to reach your savings goal
by the goal date.
Check the balance for the account you selected in step 4 at the bottom
of the Contribute to Goal dialog box to ensure the account has enough
funds to cover the contribution.
Figure 3-3:

dialog box

512
You can use the buttons beside the Date and Amount text boxes to cal-
culate or find the desired amount or date entry.
7. Click OK.
The Savings Goals Planner applies the contribution to the goal amount,
creating a transfer from transaction in the source account that you spec-
ified in step 4. Jump ahead to the section called “Checking Out Your
Progress” to see how to find out how you’re doing in reaching your goal.
If the Savings Goals window doesn’t update automatically to reflect a
contribution you just made, close and reopen the window.
You can’t undo savings goal contribution transactions. You have to go to
the account register for the account from which the contribution funds
were transferred and delete the transaction there manually.
Changing Savings Goals
As much as we would like life to be cut and dried, priorities and goals often
shift or change entirely. For example, you might have to delay a vacation
that you’re saving for because of a change to a new job. Or, you might have
to postpone a car purchase because your car insurance rate increased, even
though there is the slight relief that the car you want to buy might cost a bit
less if you wait a little longer.
The Savings Goals Planner enables you to change the amount and finish date
for your savings goal. Working in the Savings Goals window, click the savings
goal that you want to update in the list of goals, and then click Edit near the
top of the window. Make the changes you want in the Edit Savings Goal
dialog box (see Figure 3-4), and then click OK. The Goal Amount listed for
the goal immediately changes in the list of goals.
Note: You can’t rename a savings goal.

Checking Out Your Progress

Checking Out Your Progress
After you’ve established any type of goal in life, you can step back and break
out the manageable steps you must take to meet the goal. As you work toward
the goal, you can check off each step you finish to document your progress
and illustrate that you’re moving toward success. Nothing motivates people
like a strong sense of accomplishment.
If you need encouragement in meeting your savings goal, you can view your
progress in the Savings Goals window. Click on the goal that you want to
view in the list of goals, and the savings goal progress bar at the bottom of
the window (Figure 3-5) illustrates how you’re doing.
✦The vertical red arrows mark the amount that you should have con-
tributed as of the current date.
✦The horizontal bar illustrates your actual contributions toward the goal
to date, as follows:
• If the bar is yellow and it stops before the red arrows, the Savings
Goal Planner is telling you that you’re behind schedule with your
contributions, and you need to step it up to meet your goal.
Figure 3-5:

• A green bar that extends beyond the red arrows tells you that you’re
ahead of schedule and should meet your goal as long as you con-
tinue to make at least the monthly contribution amount listed as the
Projected Monthly Contribution at the bottom of the window.
If you want to look at the actual contribution transfers from the source (trans-
fer from) account, open that account in the register. As illustrated in Figure 3-6,
the savings goal name appears as the category name for the transfer transac-
tions. If you want to change or delete the transfer transaction, you have to do
so here in the parent (source) account for the transfer transaction. Edit or
delete the transaction just as you would any other transaction, as described in
the sidebar elsewhere in this chapter, “Deleting register transactions.”
To see the full value of the account that you used to fund your contributions
(rather than its value less the contribution amounts), you have to hide the
savings goal contribution transactions. To hide those transactions, click the
View button above the register, and click Hide Savings Goals, as shown in
Figure 3-7. Quicken hides the transfer transactions and updates the Ending
Balance amount so that it now includes the dollar values of the hidden trans-
actions. Choose View➪Hide Savings Goals again to redisplay the transfer
transactions and ratchet the Ending Balance back downward to reflect the
dollars you’ve set aside.

If you want, you can view the register for the savings goal (asset) account to
see all of the transactions (although you can’t edit them there). To view the
register, choose Tools➪Account List or press Ctrl+A. Scroll down to the
Account List section titled Asset Accounts (under Property & Debt Accounts).
As show in Figure 3-8, the Description column identifies each savings goal
account in effect. You can double-click a listed account to open its related
register.

Deleting register transactions
If you need to delete a transaction from your reg-
ister, click on the transaction in the register and
press Ctrl+D. A small window appears asking if
you are sure you want to delete the current
transaction. Click Yes, and the transaction is
gone.
Voiding transactions is often preferable to delet-
ing. If you void the transaction, evidence of the
transaction remains in the register. So when rec-
onciling a bank account, for example, a voided
check number (without the amount) still appears
and can be cleared in the reconciliation. With a
deletion, the transaction disappears completely
from the register, useful for transactions that are
simply mistakes, but frustrating for transactions
that ought to be recorded as voids.

Making a Withdrawal from a Savings Goal
516
You also can double-click a savings goal in the Savings Goals window to view
a QuickZoom report of the contribution transactions. Chapter 2 of Book VII
explains the type of report that appears, called a QuickZoom report, and gives
details about how to work with reports.
Making a Withdrawal from a Savings Goal
Making a withdrawal from your savings goal basically works as the reverse
of making a contribution. When you enter the withdrawal, the Savings Goal
Planner transfers money from the savings goal asset account back to the
account from which you made contributions. This “frees up” those dollars,
so that you can enter expense transactions in the register as you spend the
money on your goal trip/event/purchase/and so on in real life.
Ideally, you won’t make withdrawal transactions until you’ve met your goal.
However, the Savings Goal Planner enables you to maintain the control you
need to manage your overall financial picture. If you unexpectedly have to 
fork out money for a car repair, the Savings Goal Planner has to help you work
around the reality of that unexpected expense. If you make a withdrawal from
a savings goal, the Savings Goal Planner simply recalculates your progress and
the monthly contributions you need to make to achieve your goal.

Removing a Savings Goal
517
When you need to make a withdrawal from a savings goal, open the Savings
Goals window (choose Planning➪Savings Goals from the Quicken menu) and
click the goal in the list. Click the Withdraw choice at the top of the window.
Make sure a source account (an account from which you made a contribu-
tion) is selected from the Put Funds Back into Account drop-down list, and
then specify the withdrawal Date and Amount (Figure 3-9) in those fields.
Click OK to finish the withdrawal. Quicken records the withdrawal transfer
transaction in both the savings goal account and source cash flow account
registers.
As you might imagine, Quicken won’t let you withdraw more money than
you’ve contributed to the savings goal, and won’t let you apply a withdrawal
that’s larger than an amount you’ve contributed from a particular account.
To undo the withdrawal, go to the register for the contribution account to
which you “redeposited” (transferred) the withdrawn dollars, and delete the
withdrawal (transfer) transaction.
Removing a Savings Goal
You can delete a savings goal from the Savings Goal Planner whether you’ve
actually met the goal or not. If you’ve reached a goal and have withdrawn all
the money or you’ve decided to allocate the dollars toward another financial
purpose, you also can remove the goal. You can even delete a savings goal if
you just decide you’re not interested in funding that goal any more.
To delete a goal, follow these steps:
1. Open the Savings Goals Planner window by choosing Planning➪
Savings Goals.
2. Click the goal to delete in the Goal Name list.
3. Click Delete at the top of the window.
The Delete Savings Goal dialog box shown in Figure 3-10 appears.

4. Choose what you want to delete.
To remove the savings goal and keep the asset account and its transactions
for the savings goal, click Yes. To remove both the savings goal and its trans-
actions and account, click No. Either way, the Savings Goal Planner no longer
lists the savings goal. If you change your mind altogether, you can stop the
deletion by clicking the Cancel button.
Using the Special Purchase Planner
Although a savings goal might work well for you if you have a fair amount of
discipline to review and contribute toward the goal on a regular basis, the
Special Purchase Planner might be better if you need more of a kick in the
pants to stick with a savings goal. Also, because the Special Purchase
Planner works in conjunction with the Quicken Planning Center, you can see
how your special savings goal fits in with your overall financial picture and
other planning goals. This section gives the basics for working with the
Special Purchase Planner. For more on working with other planners, see
Chapter 1 of Book VI to get started, and then refer to Chapters 2 and 4 for
more on working with other specific planners.
Specifically, the Special Purchase Planner pulls in information about any
assumptions that you’ve entered in the Planning Center.
As when creating a regular savings goal, the Special Purchase Planner enables
you to name the goal, specify how much you want to save, and set a target
date for reaching the savings goal. The Special Purchase Planner goes a step
further, however, enabling you to set up a recurring transaction to help you
meet your goal.
You can set up a scheduled transaction to prompt you to follow through with
your savings plan or even handle the savings for you. For example, you can
set up a scheduled transaction to prompt you to transfer funds from a check-
ing account to a savings account. Then, when Quicken reminds you of the
Figure 3-10:

whether you

transfer transaction, you can head on over to the ATM to get it done, or you
can execute the transfer online with online banking or Quicken Bill Pay.
If your savings goal is particularly large ($50,000 for a home remodeling proj-
ect, for example), the Special Purchase Planner’s ability to help you auto-
mate your savings might make it the better choice for your planning needs.
To open the Special Purchase Planner window, follow these steps:
1. Choose Planning➪Special Purchase Planner, or click the Special
Purchase Planner link in the Planners section of the Planning Center.
The Special Purchase Planner window (Figure 3-11) appears.
2. To create the special purchase, click the Enter link in the description
in the right pane of the Special Purchase Planner window.
The Add Special Purchase dialog box opens.
3. Click one of the This Expense Is For option buttons to specify who the

The next Add Special Expense dialog box enables you to specify various
sources to fund the savings. If you want to choose specific cash flow
accounts to fund the savings or if you’ve already set aside some money,
click the Choose Accounts button. Then click the Specific accounts option
button in the Choose Funding Accounts dialog box that appears, and click
the accounts to use in the list that appears. Or, leave the General expenses
option button selected, and then enter a value in the Amount Saved
Towards Expense text box. If you plan to borrow money to get to your
goal, enter the loan amount in the Amount from Loans text box. If you
have a monthly amount to save in mind, enter it in the Monthly Savings
Target text box (Figure 3-14).
8. Click Done, and the savings goal appears in the Special Expense list
(Figure 3-15) in the Special Purchase Planner.
9. Click Next, and the Special Purchase Planner asks how you will pay
for it.
In this screen, click the Schedule link to open the Create Scheduled
Transaction dialog box so that you can create one or more scheduled
transactions for contributing toward your goal. (See Chapter 2 of Book II
to learn how to create scheduled transactions.) Or, click the Future Loan

E
ach family handles the cost of college education differently. Some fami-
lies rely on loans and other forms of school-provided financial aid. Some
are lucky enough to receive scholarship money. Others put away money
here and there over a period of several years, and still others just write
checks. No matter how you choose to pay for college, you can account for
the savings and the costs in your Quicken program.
How Much Does College Cost?
Before you decide how much to save for college, you must answer the
bigger question: How much will it cost? You’ll probably be surprised to find
that the answer to that question is, “Not as much as you might think.” But
don’t jump ahead quite yet. First, take a look at this breakdown of expenses
you can anticipate.
✦Tuition: This is the basic cost of going to school. Tuition pays for the
classes that the school offers.
✦Books and fees: Most classes require students to acquire books, and
some classes also require added costs like lab fees and supplies.
✦Room and board: If the student is leaving home to go to school, you
will face the cost of dormitory room or apartment rent and food. If your
student is moving to an apartment, you might also have to pay the cost
of utilities and renter’s insurance.
✦Transportation: Don’t forget the cost of getting to and from school at
the beginning and end of the semester, and maybe in between for holi-
days and vacation time.

How Much Does College Cost?
526
Estimating tuition
It’s easy to determine the cost of these pieces in today’s dollars. The estimat-
ing part comes in the form of guessing what everything is going to cost when
today’s infant heads out the door for college, 17 or 18 years from now. Here
are a couple of ways you can try to zero in on the amount you need to save
for college.
✦Using statistics: According to FinAid, “The SmartStudent Guide to
Financial Aid,” located at www.finaid.org (Figure 4-1), you can expect
tuition to increase approximately 8 percent per year. This percentage is
based on research on college costs over the past 45 years. But that pro-
jection really doesn’t matter. If you want to track college costs yourself,
start with the tables shown on the FinAid Web site, and add your own
information, over the next decade or so, to determine your own best
estimate of college costs. Use published information that you can obtain
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just like FinAid did, or better yet,
keep checking back with FinAid and other college sites, for updates to
college cost projections.
Using the 8 percent annual increase as a guide, one can expect college
costs to double approximately every 9 years. Although that certainly
has been the case over the past half a century, it’s really difficult to
believe that the cost of college for today’s infants is going to be four
times today’s costs.
Figure 4-1:
You can find
college cost
statistics on
the Internet.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Saving for College
How Much Does College Cost?
527
✦Using actual costs: It’s not difficult to find out how much college costs.
Most colleges post their annual costs on their Web sites, and there are
several books on the market that compare colleges and costs. If you
have an idea where you think you want to send your child to college (or
where you want to go yourself, if you’re the student), check out the cost
information for the specific schools that interest you. Dig a little deeper
by calling some schools and asking for historical tuition and room/board
information so you can draw your own chart of how much that school’s
costs increase each year.
Estimating room and board
When I went to college, I paid $100 per month to live in the dorm, and that
included my food and limited maid service (vacuuming and laundering of
bed sheets). Granted, that was a few years ago. But wow! What a significant
change has occurred since I was a student! Last year, I paid $1,100 a month
for my daughter’s dorm (double room) and meal costs at a private college.
The year before, I paid $800 a month for the same thing at a state university.
Once again, you can examine statistics for rising costs of room and board
over a period of several years, and you can monitor the actual room and
board costs at the various colleges that you think are possible choices for
your child.
Estimating transportation costs
Transportation costs vary on a per student basis. Factors to consider
include the distance between school and home, the frequency with which
the student wants to come home, and the type of transportation necessary
to get the student back and forth between home and school.
After you determine those factors, keep tabs on the cost of fuel and public
transportation costs and consider car-pooling options.
For some families, transportation is a significant cost. For students who
attend school close to home, transportation costs are negligible.
Estimating the cost of books and supplies
Book fees are usually a relatively small cost compared to the other costs of
higher education, but this is definitely not a cost to overlook. Books can run
from $500 to $1,000 per semester, and even more, depending on the type and
quantity of courses the student is taking, and the availability of used books
and book rentals.
College Web sites often provide an estimate of the typical cost of books for
their students, and this is a good guide for planning purposes.

How Much Does College Cost?
528
Consider incidental school supply costs as well, such as paper, pens and
pencils, stapler, tape, paper clips, a planner or assignment book, folders, and
so on.
College requires an investment in many other items as well. If you have more
than one child, you’ll learn to anticipate all of the college costs by the time
you’ve sent two or three children to school. For the first child, incidental
costs can be an eye-opener.
Great resource for college planning
You can take a lot of the headache, not to men-
tion the debate, out of estimating the cost of a
college education. Visit Salary.com’s College
Tuition Planner (see the following figure) where
you can enter your child’s age and the college
of your choice to get a really cool estimate of
how much the school will cost when your child
is of college age. You’ll also get another per-
spective on how much you should sock away
for college.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Saving for College

529
In addition to last-minute clothing items, your student may need (or want)
larger items as well, including bedding, television, refrigerator, microwave,
telephone, computer, printer, and so on. You might not need to acquire 
all of these things, and a roommate might help out by bringing some items.
However, don’t discount the possibility that these items might need to be
added to your school planning list.
Using the College Planner
Quicken’s College Planner provides you with a place where you can summa-
rize everything you know about the projected cost and funding possibilities
for the college education you are planning on purchasing. It only takes about
five minutes to go through the planner, at least with some rough estimates —
you can always come back later and fine-tune your entries with more accu-
rate data.
Imagine the following sample scenario:
✦Your child is 12 years old and you have not saved any money specifically
for college.
✦You intend to pay for your child to attend the state university in your
home state. Should the child want to go to a different, more expensive
school, you intend to have the child work and take out loans if neces-
sary to pay for the difference.
✦Based on information provided on the Web site of the state university,
you know that, if your child were to go to college today, the tuition and
fees for one year (two semesters) would break down as follows:
• Tuition: $6,290 per semester
• Room and board: $6,390
• Books: $700
• Other mandatory campus fees: $410
✦You are willing to start saving now, and want Quicken to tell you how
much you should save each month so that by the time your child fin-
ishes the fourth year of college, your payments will cover all of the
costs.
Step-by-step through the College Planner
Using the information above, here’s how to make your way through the
College Planner:

Using the College Planner
530
1. Open the College Planner.
Indeed — that will help a lot with this exercise! If your Planning Center
screen is displayed in Quicken, you’ll see the link to the College Planner
over in the Planners section. Otherwise, click Planning on the Quicken
menu and choose College Planner.
If you’ve already played around with the College Planner, the menu
option is a little different. Instead of choosing College Planner, you’ll
click on College Plans. From there, a side menu appears, showing you
any plans you created previously, along with a choice to create a New
College Plan. Pick the New College Plan and then we can continue.
You can only plan for one child at a time with the planner. However, if
you expect to have two family members in college at the same time, you
can create separate plans for each family member, or just increase the
amounts you enter in one college plan to accommodate two students.
2. Click Next to move past the Welcome screen.
You should see the Welcome screen when you open the College Planner.
If you don’t, just click on Welcome over on the menu at the left, and then
click Next to move on into the meat of the planner.
3. Enter student data.
In a new college plan, no information is yet recorded about the student.
Don’t click Next yet — instead, click the Here link to open a data entry
window. In the Personal Information window that appears (see Figure 4-2),
enter the name of the student (click the This Expense Is For drop-down
menu and choose a name from among those family members you’ve
already introduced to Quicken, or pick <add dependent> to enter the
name and birth date of another family member).
Figure 4-2:
Enter

Book VI
Chapter 4
Saving for College
Using the College Planner
531
You can use Quicken’s description or enter whatever description you
like, and then enter the date when you expect college payments to begin.
In my example, I’ve indicated that I plan to begin paying for college in
the fall of 2010. Also, be sure to indicate how many years you expect col-
lege to last. Some degree programs take five years. Some students gradu-
ate from high school with enough college credits to finish in three years.
You must enter a whole number for the number of years in college. Click
Done to complete the personal information window, and then Next to
move ahead in the planner.
When entering information about when you expect the student to begin
college, you might see a choice like, Student name is (years old), and then
you can enter how old the child will be when college begins. If you’ve
created a financial plan for your family, as described in Chapter 1 of this
book, the creation of that plan triggers options like this one in the College
Planner. If you haven’t experimented with the financial plan yet, just enter
the actual date when you expect college to begin.
4. Enter college cost information.
Click the Here link when you’re ready to enter the college cost informa-
tion that you’ve gathered. The College Cost window appears (Figure 4-3).
Remember, it’s OK to estimate this information and come back later with
updated amounts. Enter tuition, room and board, estimated book costs,
and other expenses. Check the Out-of-State Fees box if your student is
attending an out-of-state school. Other expenses can include transporta-
tion costs and the additional accoutrements of college living. As you can
see when you click the Done button, Quicken multiplies the amount you
entered by four (or however many years you said college would last) to
come up with a preliminary cost for all the years of college.
Be sure to enter just the costs for one year of college. Quicken can do
the math to determine the cost of multiple years.
Figure 4-3:
Enter your
best
estimate 
of what
college
costs today.

Using the College Planner
532
On any of the planner screens, you can click the Edit option to go back
and make changes to your information.
5. Enter student funding information.
On this screen, shown at Figure 4-4, you need to estimate how much
money you expect to receive from grants and scholarships (financial
aid), student loans, gifts, and how much you expect the student to con-
tribute. Remember, these are per-year amounts as opposed to per-four-
year amounts.
Note that on the main College Planner screen, Quicken includes links 
to several different Internet pages that provide information about and
resources for scholarships, grants, and student loans. Click any of these
links to read more about these areas.
If you click out of the College Planner to explore the links provided by
Quicken, and then close the Internet window you were viewing, it looks
like your planner has disappeared. Look down at the bottom of the
Quicken screen and you’ll see a button for the College expenses. Click
that button to resume your planner session.
6. Examine the college cost summary and click Previous if you need to
go back and make any changes to the information you entered.
Now consider the money you have saved that is earmarked for college.
7. Click Next to move to the Savings and Investments screen of the plan-
ner, and then click the Here link to open the Inflation & Funding
window (Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-4:
Estimate
how much
you expect
to or hope 
to receive

Book VI
Chapter 4
Saving for College
Using the College Planner
533
You are asked to enter an estimate of the rate at which you think infla-
tion will affect college costs. This is clearly an estimate, but you don’t
have to pick a number out of thin air. Look at the Web sites for the col-
lege(s) you are considering. You might find some information there set-
ting out the historical tuition and fees increases at that institution. That
is how I chose the custom rate of 4 percent for my college cost inflation
figure. Tuition and fees at the state university in my state have increased
at an average annual rate of approximately 4 percent for the past several
years.
The estimated inflation rate is an annual rate, not the total rate of
increase you expect to see between now and the time your student 
goes to college.
8. Click Choose Accounts to indicate where your share of the money is
going to come from.
When you click the Choose Accounts button, the Choose Funding
Accounts window appears (Figure 4-6). At the bottom of the window,
enter the amount you’ve already put aside for college expenses. This
can include amounts that you have sitting in an IRA or equity in your
home, as well as savings and money market accounts. The amount you
enter here should be cash you can readily access and that you fully
intend to use for college. The remainder of the college expenses are
going to be furnished from either your general expenses, meaning any
account where you have money, or from specific accounts. Choose
Specific Accounts if you want to only include certain accounts, or if 
you want to exclude certain accounts as sources for college funding. 
A list of all your accounts appears, and you can check off only the
accounts that you plan to use for paying for college.

9. Examine the bottom line.
After you enter the account information from step 8, Quicken presents
you with its calculation of how much you need to put aside each month,
starting now and going through all the years while your student is in col-
lege, so that you’ll have enough money for college.
On the Results screen, the college savings plan is incorporated into your
larger personal financial plan in the form of an Account Balances chart.
If you haven’t created a personal financial plan yet, you see a list of
financial subject areas where you can click to add more information.
This is optional and only necessary if you want to incorporate the col-
lege expenses into a bigger all-encompassing financial picture.
10. Click Summary on the menu at the left to see a final summary of all of
the information you’ve entered, or click Internet Resources to find
links to a variety of interesting info.
Using the Internet Resources links, you can find information about finan-
cial aid, scholarships, college loans, and college planning in general.
Saving (and finding) your projections
There’s no need to take special steps to save your work in the College
Planner. All of the information you entered is automatically saved. But the
information is not where you might expect it to be. The next time you return
to the College Planner, it will look like you’ve never been there before. Each
time you start the College Planner, it returns to an empty shell. So where did
your projection go?

After you’ve set up your budget, it’s easy to incorporate expenses, including
your college savings plan, into your budget. Here’s how:
Removing a college planning scenario
If you experiment with the College Planner and
want to remove the scenario that you created,
you can do so from the Results page in the
College Planner in either of the following ways:
 If an Account Balances chart appears,
click the Change Assumptions button that
appears at the bottom of the page. Then
click College Expenses from the menu at
the left side of the screen. Click the Edit
button that appears at the top of the page.
 If you don’t have a financial plan chart, you
can click College Expenses on the list of
assumptions that appears.
With either method, the Quicken Planner:
College Expenses window appears (see the fol-
lowing figure). Click on the description that you
want to remove, and then click the Delete
button. Click Yes when asked to confirm the
deletion, and then Done to close the window.

Using the College Planner
536
1. Open the budget by choosing Planning➪Budget from the menu.
2. Click on the Savings tab.
3. Click on the name of the account you want to use for your college 
savings.
If the account name does not appear on the budget screen, click the
Choose Accounts button at the bottom of the screen, and then click on
the account you want to use for your college savings. This might be a
529 account, a money market, or a savings account.
4. On the right side of the budget screen, enter the amount you want to
transfer each month (or quarter, or week, or whatever) to the college
account, and indicate the frequency with which you want to make this
transfer (see Figure 4-8).
5. Click the Apply button; otherwise, your amount won’t be saved.
You can set up automatic transfers to your college savings account to
ensure that the proper amount gets deposited.
You’ll find more information about setting up savings goals and automat-
ing your saving in Chapters 3 and 5 of this book.

Sources of Capital
No matter how young (or old) your child is, now is the time to start talking
to school authorities about how to finance your child’s education. Even if
your child isn’t in high school, you can schedule a session with the high
school’s college counselor. Go to college planning meetings in your commu-
nity and start a dialog with financial aid people at the college where you
think your child might want to attend.
Seek out information about scholarships and start thinking now about how
your child can position himself to receive scholarship money — maybe by
joining an organization, participating in athletics or arts, or working with
community service organizations. Check with your employer and ask people
you know who already have kids in college.
The high school counselor is a good source for scholarship information and
can tell you what your child should do when he gets to high school to ensure
the most money from colleges that offer merit scholarships. For example, the
counselor might suggest that you explain to the student the importance of
establishing a rapport with influential teachers because teacher recommen-
dations are an important part of the application process. Also, your child
should participate in some kind of school-sponsored or extra-curricular
activity so that information can be included on the college application.

Cashing out your IRA/401(k)
Back in Chapter 2 of this book, we talked about the possibility of using money
from your tax-deferred retirement funds for college expenses. The IRS makes it
possible to take money from these funds, in particular your IRA, to pay for
college. And although the money might be subject to income tax when you
remove it from the fund, you can avoid paying a penalty on the money if it is
used expressly for college costs.
You don’t have to get anyone’s permission to take the money out of your IRA
for college expenses (except perhaps that little voice inside you that reminds
you you’re dipping into the money you were supposed to save for retirement).
The 401(k) plan is a different story. Remember, to take money out of your
401(k) for college, the cost has to be a bona fide hardship. You have to prove
that you have exhausted all other avenues for borrowing money, including
attempting to borrow from your 401(k).
In situations where you withdraw money from your 401(k) or your IRA, you
are required to pay income tax on the amount you withdraw, in the year in
which you withdraw it. An exception to this rule occurs if you are withdraw-
ing non-tax-deferred money from your IRA, meaning you are withdrawing
money that you didn’t take as a tax deduction when you contributed it to the
IRA. The portion of the money you withdraw from your IRA that represents
earnings on your investment will always be subject to income tax.
If you decide to borrow money from your 401(k) account, remember the
hidden costs associated with borrowing. Sometimes these costs are over-
shadowed by the ease of the loan and the low interest rate. See Table 2-1 in
Chapter 2 of this book for an analysis of those hidden costs.
You cannot take a loan against your IRA money.
Home equity loan/line of credit
If you own a home, borrowing money against the equity in that home is one
way to pay for college. If this is your long-range plan, be sure to monitor the
value of your home over the years to make sure that the money will be there.
Home values rise and fall with the marketplace, and that can affect your bor-
rowing power. In addition, make sure you keep your credit rating up so that
you can borrow without any problem.
Paying for a College Education with a 529 Plan
You can flip back to Chapter 5 of Book I for a complete description of 529
plans, what they are, how they work, and where you can go for more informa-
tion. This is becoming one of the most popular methods of saving for college,

particularly with families with young children. If your child is older and you
only have a few years to save, the tax savings from the 529 might not be very
significant.
Some states allow you to take a deduction on your state income tax return
for the amount of money contributed to a 529 plan.
Some states don’t let you create a 529 plan if your child is age 15 or older.
And, some states are particularly nasty about taking money out of the plan
for non-educational uses and assess an extra 10 percent penalty.
Hey, don’t let one state’s rules keep you from getting in on the 529 gold rush.
You can participate in a 529 plan in any state: It doesn’t matter if you live in
that state or not, and it doesn’t matter if the plan beneficiary goes to school
in that state or not. So there!
If you’re going to invest in a 529 plan, don’t feel you have to pay the fee of 
a broker or financial advisor who can invest your money for you. You can 
go directly to the state plan to avoid fees and invest directly without a 
middleman.
Money earned in a 529 plan counts against you when it’s time to calculate
your eligibility for financial aid. This is one argument that financial advisors
have against the 529 plans. For this reason, if you have substantial money
available to invest long-term for college, it makes sense to seek the advice of
a financial professional who can point you in the best direction for maximiz-
ing your earnings and keeping your financial aid options open.
Gifting stock: Not the bargain you might think
If you come from a stock-holding family, you
might be planning on cashing in some of the
stock you own to pay for your child’s education.
Although the stock might be an excellent
source of ready cash, particularly if it’s stock
you are ready to sell anyway, don’t think you’re
going to pull one over on the IRS by gifting the
stock to your child so the child can sell the
stock and use the proceeds for college.
If you gift stock that has appreciated in value,
the cost basis (purchase price) of the stock
transfers over to the recipient of the gift, mean-
ing when the child sells that stock you bought
for $20 a share that is now worth $150 a share,
the child is going to have to pay tax on $130 per
share, just like you would if you sold the stock
yourself.
And it gets worse. If you gift stock on which you
lost money (for example, that stock you bought
for $50 a share that is now only worth $30 a
share), the child’s basis is the fair market value
of the stock on the day of the gift, meaning the
child won’t get the tax benefit of that $20 a share
loss. In this case, be sure you sell the stock your-
self, take the tax loss on your own tax return, and
then give the cash proceeds to the child.

Setting up 529 in Quicken
To set up a new 529 plan in Quicken, Intuit recommends that you use the
Roth IRA structure for the account. Therefore, when setting up a new 529
plan, follow these steps:
1. Open the Account Setup screen by pressing Ctrl+A, and then clicking
Add Account.
2. Enter the name of the financial institution, or click the option for No
Financial Institution if this is the case.
3. Choose IRA as the type of account (see Figure 4-9).
4. Give the account a name that distinguishes it from your other
accounts.
5. Indicate that this is a Roth IRA.
I know it’s not, and you know it’s not, but Quicken doesn’t seem to know
about 529 accounts, so we’ll play along and call this a Roth IRA (Fig-
ure 4-10). That’s not a far cry from the actual account type — these
types of savings accounts are very similar. Click Next.
6. Enter the particulars from your last statement.
If you’ve got a statement for this account, enter the statement date and
the amount of any cash or money market money in the account. If this is
a brand new account and there’s nothing going on yet, just enter today’s
date and leave the amounts at zero. Click Next to continue.

7. Enter the ticker symbol for each of the investments in this account.
If you’ve set up any other types of stock or mutual fund accounts in
Quicken, this is getting to be routine. If you’re new to this type of setup,
you need to get the ticker symbol for each fund that you plan to hold in
the account. Click the Lookup button at the bottom if you need help fig-
uring out the ticker symbols. You don’t have to enter the names of the
funds — Quicken is going to look up your ticker symbols and enter the
names. Click Next when you’ve finished entering all the ticker symbols.
8. Enter your share holdings (see Figure 4-11).
If you haven’t actually bought any shares yet, you can leave the share
information at zero. If you have shares, copy the quantity, including all
the decimal places, from your most recent statement.

9. Review your information on the Summary screen, and then click Done.
Your 529 account is up and running.
Making contributions to a 529 plan
When you contribute money to a 529 plan, you can either issue a check, or
transfer the funds online if you have online access for both the 529 plan and
your bank account. Keep in mind that the contribution that you make to a 529
plan doesn’t necessarily have to be made to your 529 plan. You can contribute
money to somebody else’s 529 plan if you want — for example, grandparents
might want to put aside money for their grandchild in that child’s 529 plan.
If you’re preparing a check for your contribution, write the check to the plan
or fund name, as shown in the example at Figure 4-12. In Quicken, you can
assign the check to a category such as 529 Plan or a Gift category. The 529
contribution is considered by the IRS to be a gift to the plan’s beneficiary.
If your 529 is at your own bank, and you’ve signed up for online banking serv-
ices through Quicken, you can perform a transfer of funds from your regular
bank account to the 529 account.

If your 529 is at another financial institution or brokerage, and you use
Quicken Bill Pay, you can set up that account for automatic transfer as well.
Monitoring your 529 plan
Most 529 plans come with an assortment of investment choices, ranging from
somewhat risky and growth-oriented to barely risky at all with lower return
on investment. The idea is that when your child is young, you can afford to
speculate a little with the money and try a riskier path of investing, hopeful
that you’ll get a little better return on your money than you would in a simple
money market fund.
As the child gets closer to the time when college payments will begin, realign
your 529 investments so that there is little risk and the money is safe and
ready to be withdrawn and used for college payments.
Financial advisors warn investors that of all the investments you maintain,
the 529 plan probably warrants the closest ongoing scrutiny. This is money
that you can’t afford to put at risk. So if your plan is diversified over a few
different accounts and one account starts losing in value, you need to act
quickly to assess the reasons for the movement and consider switching your
money to a different fund option.
Many 529 plans charge an administrative fee; sometimes, it’s an annual fee.
Depending on how much you plan to contribute and how much tax savings
you anticipate, the fee could essentially wipe out the benefit from having the
529 plan. It’s worthwhile to carefully compare plans across the states (www.
savingforcollege.com offers a comparative chart) before deciding which
plan to use or whether the 529 is for you.
Taking money out of the 529 plan
In January, the owner of a 529 plan receives Form 1099-Q (Payments from
Qualified Education Programs) indicating how much money was withdrawn
from the account in the previous year. The form shows how much of the
withdrawn money is made up of the fund’s principal and how much is earn-
ings. This is important if the money was not used for its intended (educa-
tional) purpose.
The plan owner can withdraw money from a 529 plan at any time. Here are
some key points to keep in mind regarding withdrawals from a 529 plan:
✦It’s possible that some money was taken from the fund and rolled over
into the 529 fund for another family member. This is perfectly legal and
appropriate if the rollover deposit is made within 60 days of the with-
drawal. In this case, there is no tax effect on the removal of money from
the 529.

Setting Up a Coverdell Education Savings Account in Quicken
544
✦Money taken from the plan and used for college-level education and
related expenses (such as room and board), for the intended benefici-
ary, is not subject to taxation.
✦Money taken from the account for any other reason is subject to a 10
percent penalty and income taxation. The earnings from the fund are
reported on the tax return of the person who actually received the money,
no matter who contributed the money to the fund. The principal portion
of the money withdrawn from the fund is not subject to income tax.
Setting Up a Coverdell Education 
Savings Account in Quicken
The Coverdell Education Savings Account (formerly known as the Education
IRA) is a tax-deferred account available as yet another option for saving for
college.
Unlike the 529 plan, in which anyone can participate, income restrictions
keep some people from participating in a Coverdell ESA plan.
Unlike the 529 plan, you are limited as to how much you can contribute each
year to a Coverdell ESA plan. The maximum contribution is $2,000 per bene-
ficiary. You can set up plans for multiple beneficiaries, but only $2,000 per
beneficiary is allowed each year, and that includes combining contributions
for that beneficiary from various sources.
More rules: The Coverdell child must be under age 18 to receive a contribu-
tion in his name.
This investment and savings account is established solely for the purpose 
of paying higher education expenses. Contributions are not deductible from
current income taxes. Earnings grow tax-deferred and distributions are tax-
free if used to pay qualified educational expenses.
You can read more information about the Coverdell ESA in Chapter 5, Book I.
Briefly, here are the requirements for operating a Coverdell ESA in Quicken:
✦Setting up the account is just like setting up the 529 account, except
instead of describing this account as a Roth IRA, you can pick
Educational IRA during the account setup phase.
✦Transferring money into the account is done exactly like I described
these transfers in the 529 account section. You can write a check and
deposit that check, or, if you have online banking and the account is at

Book VI
Chapter 4
Saving for College

545
the same bank as your regular bank account, you can execute a funds
transfer from within Quicken. If you use Bill Pay, you can transfer funds
between your bank and the IRA even if they are not located at the same
financial institution.
✦When it’s time to take money out to pay for school costs, money is dis-
tributed from the account and transferred into a bank account for pur-
poses of using the money for tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment,
room and board.
✦At tax time, the owner of the Educational IRA receives Form 1099-Q show-
ing the total amount of money withdrawn from the account during the
previous year.
The Coverdell plan is considered an asset of the child’s and counts against
her during calculations for financial aid. In the case of the 529 plan, only the
plan’s earnings are considered an asset of the child’s for purposes of finan-
cial aid calculations.
What happens if the child doesn’t go to college?
Education funds such as the 529 and Coverdell
Education Savings Account are typically created
with the best of intentions. But they are also
sometimes created before it can be determined
if the child beneficiary will actually attend col-
lege, or how much that college will cost.
If it turns out that one of these situations exist,
the earnings that accumulated in the fund can
be subject to both income tax and a penalty.
 The student isn’t ready for college, but you
need the money, so you take the money out
of the plan and use it for something other
than college costs.
 The beneficiary dies or becomes disabled
(no penalty here).
 In the event of the Coverdell fund, the ben-
eficiary turns age 30 without having used
the money.
 The beneficiary does not go to college.
 The beneficiary goes to college but receives
enough scholarship money to cover costs
or doesn’t incur costs in excess of the
amount in the plan, and thus doesn’t need
all of the tax-protected money in the edu-
cation fund.
To make matters more confusing, each state
has its own rules about what gets taxed, to
whom, and when. Basically, you should expect
that if you take money out of the plan and don’t
use it for education, the person who gets the
money pays income tax and a 10 percent penalty
on the amount of the proceeds that represents
earnings.

t’s not uncommon to read stories about millionaires and how they
amassed their money. Often, these people didn’t launch their own busi-
nesses or succeed through some type of get-rich-quick scheme. Instead, they
worked modest jobs, chose a low-key (some might say cheap) lifestyle, and
saved money regularly. Although there’s no guarantee that using Quicken to
help you manage and save your money will make you a millionaire, Quicken
does include some tools to remind you when to save and how much to save.
Find out now how to use scheduled transactions, reminders, and trans-
actions groups to set up and manage your savings program.
Setting Up Scheduled Savings Transactions
If you’ve ever listened to financial advisors give their tips for saving, you’ve
no doubt heard the chant, “Pay yourself first.” If you take this sage advice,
you’ll regularly place money in a savings or investing vehicle of some type
rather than leaving it in a checking account where you might be tempted to
spend it. The “pay yourself first” theory dictates a process of diverting money
from your paycheck directly to savings, without passing Go, without collect-
ing $200, and without first paying your bills. When you save first and live on
what’s left, you see that you really can cover your current needs while build-
ing an emergency fund or a long-term savings account.
I like to look at “Pay yourself first” like this. Pretend your boss calls you into
the office and explains that times are tough and the company needs to cut
back. Don’t worry, he says, your job is safe. But . . . (you’ve gotta love it when
they start a sentence with “But . . .”) as a result of the cut backs, effective
immediately, you have to suffer a 10 percent decrease in pay.

Setting Up Scheduled Savings Transactions
548
Maybe you’d start looking for a new job as soon as you leave the boss’s office.
In the short run, however, you’re going to have to learn to live on 10 percent
less income. Now — back to reality. Try turning that imaginary scenario into a
forced 10 percent diversion into savings. Pretend you simply don’t have that
extra 10 percent. Before you know it, you just might get used to living with a
little less pocket change. Then you can watch your savings grow!
How much you save is up to you. Experts say you should always have an
emergency fund with at least enough savings to cover four to six months’ of
expenses (this is necessary expenses, not luxury items). So, if you need about
$3,000 per month to pay for the essentials in your household (mortgage or
rent, utilities, food, insurance, and transportation), you should have an
emergency fund of at least $12,000 to $18,000. After you’ve built that base,
you should save even more for long-term purposes.
Not to go on a rant, but we U.S. citizens aren’t known for saving very much
of our income. For the last year of reported data, the typical average savings
rate was about 0 percent. Although you might hate to trade lunches out of
the office for brown-bagging it, you will appreciate having the funds you
need when an unexpected event hits or when there’s some change in your
income level.
Trying to save money? Grab a copy of my book, Surviving Financial Down-
sizing: A Practical Guide to Living Well on Less Income, for plenty of tips on
cutting back your expenses without sacrificing your lifestyle.
Motivated to save yet? Good. Quicken can help you begin to make regular
investments into your savings or investment accounts. Use the Scheduled
Transaction List to create scheduled savings transactions.
Adding the scheduled transaction
As you learned in Chapter 2 of Book II, you can set up a scheduled transac-
tion to remind you of any bill or deposit that happens on a regular basis. For
example, you might set up a scheduled transaction to remind you to pay a
monthly phone bill or to record a paycheck received.
In Quicken, you also can create a scheduled transaction to remind you to
make a regular deposit to a savings or investment account (or both). For
example, if you decide that you want to transfer $150 per month from your
checking account to your savings account, you can set up a scheduled trans-
action to prompt you a few days in advance to make the transfer.
If you’re banking manually in Quicken, you should create a scheduled trans-
action to record that $150 per month. If you’re banking online with Quicken,
the withdrawal transactions will download into Quicken automatically, so
you don’t need to create the scheduled transaction.

When you open the Scheduled Transaction List, you see commands that
enable you to create your scheduled transactions, including scheduled
transactions to prompt you to save your money. Follow these steps to 
set up the scheduled transaction:
1. Choose Cash Flow➪Scheduled Transaction List or press Ctrl+J from
any Quicken window.
The Scheduled Transaction List window (Figure 5-1) appears.
2. Click Create New➪Scheduled Transaction.
The Create Scheduled Transaction dialog box opens.
3. Choose the settings for the scheduled savings transaction.
Refer to Chapter 2 of Book II to learn more about the ins and outs of
using the Create Scheduled Transaction dialog box. For example, the
entries shown in Figure 5-2 create a scheduled transaction that reminds
you to transfer $250 per month from the Huntington Checking account
to the Huntington Savings account. The transaction repeats on the first
of each month, with a reminder three days in advance.

4. Click OK to finish creating the scheduled transaction.
The new transaction appears in the list in the All Types tab of the
Scheduled Transaction List window.
5. Click the X button for the Scheduled Transaction List window to 
close it.
Shortcut alert! If the transaction you want to schedule already appears in
your register, you can right-click on the transaction and choose Schedule
Transaction to open the Create Scheduled Transaction dialog box. Then 
continue with step 3 above.
Following through with the transaction
When you open Quicken on a date when a savings or investment transaction is
scheduled, you’ll have a few different clues that the transaction is coming due:
✦If you’re looking at the Quicken Home page, you will see the scheduled
transaction in the Bills and Scheduled Transactions section of the page
(Figure 5-3). You might need to change the Show drop-down list setting
to Current – by Status to see the reminder for a scheduled savings trans-
action that’s due soon.

✦If you use Quicken’s Billminder (see Book IV, Chapter 4), the scheduled
transaction appears on the Billminder screen as soon as you boot up
your computer.
✦If the account from which the scheduled savings transaction funds will
be transferred or withdrawn is visible in the Account Bar at the left side
of the Quicken window, a flag appears beside the account name, signify-
ing a scheduled transaction is pending.
✦Finally, if you’re working in the register for the account from which the
savings funds will be transferred or withdrawn, the Scheduled Trans-
actions tab near the bottom of the register displays something other
than (0), such as (1 Due). Click the tab, like the one shown in Figure 5-4,
to see the scheduled savings transaction.
You have to use the register and its Scheduled Transactions tab to enter the
actual scheduled savings transaction, like this:
1. Click the Enter button at the right end of the line holding the sched-
uled savings transaction (refer to Figure 5-4) in the Scheduled Trans-
actions tab.

2. Make any necessary changes before recording the transaction.
For example, if you need to delay your savings transaction, change the
Date entry. If you want to save more (don’t let yourself down by saving
less!), increase the Amount entry.
3. Click the Record Payment button.
Quicken records the transaction in the register.
4. Now you have to ensure that the withdrawal/deposit or transfer repre-
sented by the transaction happens in the real world. Take one of the
following actions, depending on the situation:
• If the transaction represents a transfer from a checking and savings
account at the same bank, visit your bank’s ATM or teller window to
make the transfer.
Some banks allow telephone transfers of funds between accounts.
• If the transaction represents a withdrawal from an account at one
bank and a deposit to an account at another bank, visit the two
banks to make each transaction.
• If the transaction represents a withdrawal of money from a checking
account to make a deposit in an investment account (and you haven’t
set up automatic withdrawals), send a check in the applicable amount
to your investment company, using the appropriate deposit slip and
account number. Similarly, if you’re setting aside money for a certifi-
cate of deposit, purchase it at your bank or from an online bank.
• If the checking and savings accounts involved are at the same bank,
and your bank allows online transfers between those accounts, and
both accounts are set up for online banking, you can convert the reg-
ister transaction to an online instruction to make the transfer elec-
tronically. To do this, click the Num field (which would typically hold
the check number) for the transaction in the register, click the drop-
down list arrow that appears beside the field, and then choose Online
Transfer, as shown in Figure 5-6. Update the date for the transaction
to match the current date, and then click or press Enter. From there,
go to the Online Center to send the transfer instruction. See Chap-
ter 5 of Book II to learn how to send the transfer instruction to your
bank.
• If you use Quicken Bill Pay, and both accounts are set up in Bill Pay
(see Book IV, Chapter 4), you can transfer the funds online at the Bill
Pay window. Go to www.quicken.com, click My Quicken, and then
click Quicken Bill Pay Log In.

You can use a couple of other tricks in Quicken to remind you to stick with
your schedule of regular savings: the Calendar and alerts. As you get more
familiar with Quicken, you’ll decide which of the features you like best. Some
people use the Calendar daily, and others never open their Calendar. Some
people are conscientious about checking alerts regularly; others ignore the
alerts. These descriptions provide you with some alternatives for getting
notifications of your scheduled transactions. It’s up to you to decide which
of the features you want to use.
Scheduled transactions and Quicken’s Calendar
Quicken automatically adds a notation about any scheduled transaction 
you set up to the Calendar. To open the Calendar in its own window, choose
Tools➪Calendar or press Ctrl+K. As shown in Figure 5-7, the Calendar 
looks like a traditional monthly paper calendar with a square representing
each day.

Click the Prev Month and Next Month buttons as needed to view the
Calendar for various months. If you want to see more detail about the trans-
actions scheduled on a particular date, double-click the box for the day. 
In the Transactions Due window that appears (Figure 5-8), you can click a
transaction and then click the Edit button to view and change details about
the scheduled transaction and all future instances of that scheduled trans-
actions. Click the Transaction Due window X button when you’ve finished
viewing the transactions.
If you want to schedule an instance of a memorized or scheduled transac-
tion, you can drag the desired transaction from the list at the right and drop
it onto the desired date on the calendar.
Savings goal contributions (see Chapter 3 of Book VI) that you’ve scheduled
also appear on the applicable dates in the Calendar.
If you think a scheduled transaction is overkill, you can add a calendar note
to remind you to save money without setting up a scheduled transaction. To
create a calendar note for a particular date:
1. Click the date on the Calendar.
2. Click the Add Note choice at the top of the window.

If you want, you can print the calendar for the currently displayed month. To
start the process, click the Print button in the Calendar window, change the
settings in the Print dialog box if desired, and then click OK. As the example
Print Preview of a Calendar in Figure 5-11 shows, the printout also lists
scheduled transactions and notes below the calendar itself.
When you’ve finished working with the Calendar, click the Calendar window’s
X button to send the Calendar into hiding.
Alerts to alert you!
Here’s one last way to ensure that Quicken shows you when you have sched-
uled savings transactions coming . . . If you aren’t seeing reminders about your
scheduled transactions in the Quicken Home Page, you need to check to ensure
that alerts for scheduled transactions have been enabled in the Alerts Center.
Choose Tools➪Set Up Alerts. Click the plus button beside the General category
to expand that category, and then click the plus button beside Reminder. Make
sure a green check box appears to the right of the Scheduled Transactions Due
item, as shown in Figure 5-12. If you don’t see a check, click the check box to
make it appear. Click OK when you’ve finished enabling the alerts.

Adjusting Your Scheduled Transactions

Adjusting Your Scheduled Transactions
If you’re being diligent with your savings efforts and are continuing to
explore more ways to trim the fat out of your spending (no excuses!), you
soon might need to edit the scheduled transaction you’ve created for your
savings plan so that you can increase the amount for the transaction.
As noted briefly above, if you open a scheduled transaction from the Calendar,
you can make changes to that and any future instances of the scheduled trans-
action. The Scheduled Transaction List also enables you make a change to
any scheduled transaction, including one that you’ve set up to prompt you to
make a regular savings contribution.
Changing a scheduled transaction changes only future recurrences of the
transaction, not any past instances of the transaction that you’ve already
entered into the register.
To make a change to a scheduled transaction:
1. Choose Cash Flow➪Scheduled Transaction List or press Ctrl+J from
any Quicken window.
The Scheduled Transaction List window appears.
2. Click the Scheduled tab.
3. In the list of transactions on the tab, click the Edit button at the right
end of the line for the scheduled transaction.
The transaction information appears in the Edit All Future Transactions
dialog box (Figure 5-13).
4. Change settings as needed, such as increasing the transaction (sav-
ings) amount.
5. Click the OK button.
Quicken updates the scheduled transaction so that all future instances
will reflect your increased savings.
6. Close the Scheduled Transaction List window.

Setting Up Investment Transaction Groups
560
Setting Up Investment Transaction Groups
If you make a regular contribution to an investment account to purchase
more shares of a single security or fund, you can set up that transaction as a
regular recurring transaction.
This type of scheduled investment, where you invest the same amount with
each transaction, no matter how many shares that money purchases, has a
name. You might think of it as Investing the Same Amount No Matter How
Many Shares I Get. Others call this process Dollar Cost Averaging. No matter
how plain or fancy the name, the process is the same.
However, if you make a monthly contribution into an investment account but
then invest the money in multiple securities, you have to set up an invest-
ment transaction group to account for how you divide the full monthly sum
you deposit between the various securities you subsequently purchase
using the deposited funds.
The process for setting up an investment transaction group works somewhat
like setting up a scheduled transaction, with a few curveballs thrown in:
1. Assuming you just made a monthly investment into the investment
account, look at the paper statement for your account, and use the

register for the investment account to add a transaction representing
each security you bought from the monthly lump sum you deposited.
Remember, click the Enter Transaction button on the Transactions tab
of the investment account register to enter those transactions. Find more
examples of entering investment transactions in Book III, Chapter 1.
2. Click each of the newly added transactions on the Transactions tab of
the investment account register, and then choose Edit➪Transaction➪
Memorize Payee (Ctrl+M) to add the transaction to the Memorized
Investment Txn List.
You can’t memorize a deposit transaction, so you have to handle the
actual deposit or transfer as a regular scheduled transaction.
3. Choose Tools➪Scheduled Transaction List or press Ctrl+J to open the
Scheduled Transaction List window.
4. Choose Create New➪Scheduled Transaction.
The Create Scheduled Transaction dialog box appears.
5. Choose the name of the investment account in which you created and
memorized transactions in steps 1 and 2 from the Account to Use drop-
down list. Leave Payment selected as the Transaction method.
If needed, you can edit the transaction frequency settings, but there’s no
need to enter a transaction amount.
6. Click the Options button in the lower-left corner of the Create
Scheduled Transaction dialog box.
The Create Scheduled Transaction Options dialog box opens.
7. Click the Group button near the lower-left corner of the dialog box.
The Edit Transaction Group dialog box opens.
8. Type a name for the investment transaction group in the Group 
text box.
9. Click the Investment option button in the Choose Transactions section
of the dialog box.
The transactions you memorized in step 2 should appear in the list.
If you don’t see a memorized transaction, you either memorized it in the
wrong investment account, or you’ve already saved the transaction in
another investment transaction group.
10. Click to check the Group check box on the right side of the window
for each transaction to include in the group, as shown in Figure 5-14.

Setting Up Investment Transaction Groups
562
11. Click OK.
The Scheduled Transaction List window reappears. As shown in Fig-
ure 5-15, the transaction group appears in the Scheduled Transaction
window. The group name includes (Group X) to identify it as a group. The
amount reflects the total of all the transactions you included in the group.
From there, the investment transaction group behaves just like an indi-
vidual scheduled transaction. You see a reminder when the transaction
is coming due. You can enter the transaction group when needed using
the Enter button in the Scheduled Transaction List, or the Enter button
beside the group on the Scheduled Transactions tab of the investment
account Transactions tab (Figure 5-16). In the Record Transaction Group
dialog box, click the Record button to record the transactions.
You can use the Edit choice in the Scheduled Transaction List to change the
transactions included in a selected group, or you can use the Delete choice
to delete the group.

etting a handle on how you spend your money enables you to better
prioritize your expenses and savings. By applying categories to
Quicken transactions, you can look back to see what type of expense or
income a particular transaction represented, for example. For a look at the
overview of how you’re spending and making money in various categories,
however, you have to turn to Quicken’s graphs and reports. After you
master the techniques for viewing basic graphs and reports presented in
this chapter, you have the basic tools you need to become a more discrimi-
nating spender and saver.
Displaying Activity for a Category or Payee
The 2006 version of Quicken adds a great new feature that enables you to
view transactions in a category or made to a particular payee directly from a
register transaction. So, for example, if you want to see how much money
you’ve spent recently for medical bills or a particular utility, you can display
that information in the little report with just a couple of mouse clicks.
Quicken calls these reports minireports. The data that a minireport displays
differs depending on whether you’re viewing category or payee information:
✦Category: Quicken can display all deposits and payments for the most
recent 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, 6-month, 1-year, or 3-year period. When
you choose a minireport covering 90 days or less, Quicken subtotals the
data by payee. When you choose a longer time period, Quicken subto-
tals the information by date.
✦Payee: Quicken also can display transactions using a particular payee in
the most recent 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, 6-month, 1-year, or 3-year period.
By default, Quicken selects the shortest reporting period that contains six
transactions, although you can choose to display a longer time period.

Displaying Activity for a Category or Payee
568
You have to be working in a cash flow account to display a minireport.
A minireport may not help you solve a big financial problem, but it’s a ter-
rific tool for answering a specific question, such as whether you’ve made a
mortgage payment in the last month (view a minireport for a transaction
where your lender is the payee) or whether you’ve spent too many dollars
on entertainment recently (view a minireport for the Entertainment Expense
category).
Viewing a category minireport
When you want to see how much you’ve spent in a particular category, you
can create a minireport that displays the transactions in that category.
Create the minireport for a category by following these steps:
1. In your register, scroll to display a transaction to which you’ve
assigned the category in question in the register.
2. Click in the Category field for the transaction.
A drop-down list arrow and a minireport button (which has a sheet of
paper on it) appears at the right end of the field, as shown in Figure 1-1.
3. Click the minireport button.
The minireport appears in a pop-up box below the transaction, which
you also can see in Figure 1-1. (Note that you also can right-click the
Category field for the transaction and then click Launch Mini-Report for
Category Category Name to open the minireport.)
4. Adjust the dates.
If you’re not happy with the time period shown in the minireport, click
the drop-down list arrow (the big black triangle) to the right of the time
period shown in the minireport box, and then click another time frame
(see Figure 1-2).

5. To close the minireport, click the X button in the upper-right corner
of the report box.
Viewing a payee minireport
As you might guess, viewing a minireport of payee data works much like
viewing a minireport for a category. Simply click the Payee field in a register
transaction that uses the desired payee, and then click the minireport
button that appears to the right of the field drop-down list button. Figure 1-3
shows an example of a payee minireport, in this case, showing recent pay-
ments to a health care provider.
Viewing an expanded minireport in its own window
Although a minireport looks great onscreen, you might want to work with
the data further. You can show the minireport data as a full-blown transac-
tion report by clicking the Show Report button in the minireport box. After
you click that button, the report data appears in its own window, like the
example in Figure 1-4. Book VII, Chapter 2 explains how to work with a full
report, including how to customize, print, and save the report data. A sec-
tion called “Customizing QuickReports” later in this chapter shows you the
key techniques for slicing and dicing your report data. For now, you can just
click the report window X button to close the report.

Using QuickReports Available in the Registers
570
Using QuickReports Available in the Registers
You can skip the minireport and go directly to a basic report window. When
you’re working in the register for a bank or cash flow account, you can dis-
play a QuickReport about either the payee or category for the current trans-
action. A QuickReport simply lists the transaction pertaining to the payee or
category, without any fancy analysis. A QuickReport can save you a lot of
time if you’re trying to track down a particular check or check number, or
verify a payment to a particular payee.
Displaying a QuickReport takes no more effort than displaying a minireport.
Here’s how to display a QuickReport.
1. Click on a transaction that uses the payee or category to show in the
QuickReport.
2. Click on the Report option at the top of the Register tab.
3. Click the desired QuickReport choice (Amount Spent On or Payments
Made To) at the top of the menu.
As you can see in Figure 1-5, the menu choices display the category and
payee entries in the selected transaction.

Using QuickReports Available in the Registers
571
Quicken’s Help system says that you need to click in the Payee or Category
field to display a QuickReport, but that doesn’t appear to be the case.
However, just to be sure, you can click in one of those fields before opening
the report.
If the QuickReport choices do not appear at the top of the Report menu, it
means you haven’t selected a transaction with payee and/or category data.
Click a field in the applicable transaction to make the QuickReport choices
appear on the Report menu.
The QuickReport opens in its own window (Figure 1-6) and is titled Category
Report or Payee Report. By default, a QuickReport displays transactions for
the current year to date (YTD), but you can customize the QuickReport from
there as described in Chapter 3 of this book.
QuickReports are everywhere! You also can create a QuickReport from one
of the Category, Class, Memorized Payee, Online Payee and Security lists, as
well as the Portfolio and Savings Goals windows, and the Security Detail
view.

Using QuickReports from the Write Checks Window
572
Using QuickReports from the Write Checks Window
If you find the register view a bit constraining and prefer to use the more
attractive and familiar Write Checks window to enter checks in Quicken, you
still have access to QuickReports — but with one catch. You have to view
the QuickReport of a check’s payee or category before you print the check.
(If you’ve already printed the check, you can only open a QuickReport for
that transaction in the register.)
For more information on writing checks from within your Quicken program,
see Book II, Chapter 2.
Here’s a “once over lightly” review of using the Write Checks window. To open
the window, you can choose Cash Flow➪Write Checks, press Ctrl+W, or click
Write Checks on the Register tab. When the Write Checks window appears, 
fill out the check information, and then click the Record Check button. After
you’ve done that, the check transaction appears in the Checks to Print list at
the bottom of the Write Checks window (as well as in the register).
Now you’re at the point where you can display a QuickReport. With the
Write Checks window still displayed, click on the transaction that uses the
payee or category to report on in the Checks to Print list. Click the Report
choice in the menu bar at the top of the Write Checks window, and then click
the command for the type of QuickReport to create, as shown in Figure 1-7:
payee (Payments Made To) or category (Amount Spent On).

Customizing QuickReports
If you take a peek back to Figure 1-6, you can see that the QuickReport pro-
vides a simple, chronological list of transactions with the specified payee or
category. If you want a report that’s less of a yawner and presents information
the way you want to see it, you can tweak the QuickReport’s appearance.
For example, say you’ve displayed a Category Report QuickReport that has
hundreds of transactions. Rather than sort through all the transactions to
find ones that are most relevant, you could sort the list by transaction
amount. Or, you could change the date range, to view transactions from a
shorter period such as the current or prior month.
While working with a QuickReport, you can change the date range for the
data included in the report, include subtotals to add summary amounts, or
change the sort order for the data. The QuickReport window includes the
controls for making these report changes. These sorting methods are
described below.
For the “unabridged” version of report customization, jump ahead to Book VII,
Chapter 3.
Figure 1-7:

Checks

Customizing QuickReports
574
Changing the QuickReport date range
When it initially pops open, a QuickReport displays data for the current year
to date (YTD). In most cases, that might give you just the information you
need. However, if you’re displaying a QuickReport on January 2, the report
won’t contain much pertinent information, if any at all! On the other hand, if
it’s December 31 and you’re looking for a transaction that took place in the
prior quarter, you don’t need to see the full year of data.
The Date Range drop-down list above the report data offers choices for
changing the date range for the reported data. Most of the choices (Figure
1-8) are self-explanatory. For example, the Include All Dates choice expands
the report to show all transactions using the specified category or payee,
while the Month to Date choice limits the report data to transactions in the
current month only.
In most cases, after you make your choice from the Date Range drop-down list,
a new QuickReport window immediately opens to show the applicable data. (I
discuss some special variations in a moment.) The title for the new report will
reflect the date range that the report covers. For example, if you choose the
Month to Date range, the report title changes from Payee Report — YTD or
Category Report — YTD, to Payee Report — MTD or Category Report — MTD.

You can double-click on a transaction in a report to jump to that transaction
in the register. You also can click a transaction in the report and then click
the Edit button in the report window to change the transaction from within
the report window rather than jumping back to the register.
Reporting a particular month, quarter, or year
A few of the commands on the Date Range drop-down list enable you to set up
the report to show info from a specific month, quarter, or year. To set up the
report in this way, you must first select Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly from the
Date Range drop-down list to establish the overall reporting time frame.
After you select one of these time frames, an additional drop-down list appears
so that you can select a specific reporting period, as shown in Figure 1-9. Open
the drop-down list, and then click the actual month, quarter, or year for which
you want to see data.
Reporting from a specified date
You may have situations where you want to report from a particular date to
the present. For example, say you’ve opened a category QuickReport to
show the transactions in the Gifts Given category. You want to see how
much you’ve spent on gifts since your son’s last birthday — September 15 of
the prior year.
Figure 1-9:
When you
choose a

Quarterly,
or Yearly

time frame,
an extra
drop-down
appears and

Customizing QuickReports
576
In such a case, you would first need to click the Custom to Date choice in the
Date Range drop-down list in the QuickReport window. The Custom to Date
dialog box (Figure 1-10) would open. Enter the desired date, such as
9/15/2004, in the From text box. Click OK, and presto! The report now lists
transactions from 9/15/2004 to the present.
Reporting on custom dates
If that’s not good enough, you can change the report to display transactions
falling on or between specific starting and ending dates. Choose Custom
Dates from the Date Range drop-down list. In the Custom Date (Figure 1-11)
dialog box that appears, enter the desired starting (from) and ending (to)
dates, and then click OK.
Saving the report with custom dates
When you choose a date range other than Year to Date in a QuickReport,
Quicken generates a separate new report in its own report window. Report
windows work like other windows. You can minimize, maximize, and close
them at will. Minimized reports appear as buttons (Figure 1-12) at the
bottom of the Quicken window. To switch to another report, click its button
in the Quicken window.

If you don’t want Quicken to track a report variation that you’ve created,
click the Delete button in the Report window.
When you click the window’s X button for a report for which you’ve changed
the date range, Quicken prompts you to save the report (Figure 1-13). You
can click Don’t Save to close the report without saving it, or Cancel to keep
the report open. If you click the Save button, the Save Report dialog box
appears, so that you can name the report and specify the save location.
Book VII, Chapter 4 gives you the details on saving reports and using your
saved reports.

Customizing QuickReports
578
Adding QuickReport subtotals
Report subtotals enable you to break out partial totals within the overall
report data. For example, if you’re viewing a report about your grocery
expenditures, you might want to add monthly subtotals so you’ll have
monthly figures to compare against your budget, as shown in the example in
Figure 1-14. Or, if you’re viewing a payee QuickReport, you might want to
subtotal amounts by category to understand the details about how much of
each type of expense you’ve paid to that payee.
Make a choice from the Subtotal By drop-down list above the report data to
choose the type of subtotals to add: Week, Two Weeks, Half Month, Month,
Quarter, Half Year, Year, Category, Class, Payee, Account, or Tax Schedule. If
you’ve added subtotals but want to remove them, choose Don’t Subtotal
from the Subtotal By drop-down list.
Sorting QuickReport data
QuickReports use a default sort order that lists transactions based on the
Account, and then the date. Given that most reports cover a single account,
this results in a report that’s essentially a chronological listing of transac-
tions. You can change the sort order to help make the report easier to use.
For example, if you wanted to compare the report to the bank statement for
your checking account, it would be useful to sort the report by check
number (Account/Check #).

Checking Out Graphs from the Register

The Sort menu at the top of the report window offers several sorting
choices: Sort by Account/Date (the default), Sort by Date/Account, Sort by
Account/Check #, Sort by Amount, Sort by Payee, and Sort by Category. Open
the menu and click a sort order to reorganize your report data instantly.
The column headings above the list of transactions in the report give you a
visual cue about how the report has been sorted. The column heading for
the field by which the data has been sorted appears in bold. For example,
Figure 1-15 shows that the report transactions have been sorted by Amount.
You also can sort the report data by clicking the column heading for the field
to sort by.
Of course, you can change all three parameters—date range, subtotals, and
sort order—to create a truly custom QuickReport.
Checking Out Graphs from the Register
I often joke that I don’t do math on weekends because I’m giving my brain a
break. The truth of the matter is that I’m often using my quality weekend

time to pay bills or check my investments. My personal experience aside, it’s
often true that people avoid getting a handle on their finances because they
“don’t do numbers” or don’t find a document like a bank statement to be a
meaningful tool for decision-making.
If the raw data in a minireport or QuickReport report doesn’t seem meaning-
ful to you, maybe it’s because you’re more of a visual person, in which case
you can turn to Quicken’s graphs. (Note: I use the terms Chart and Graph
interchangeably, like Kleenex and Tissue, or Indianapolis and My Home
Town.)
As the example in Figure 1-16 illustrates, a graph presents financial informa-
tion in a visual format for more meaning and impact. Seeing that you’ve
spent $500 on rent might seem reasonable, until you see a pie chart showing
that you’re spending over half of your income (in other words, way too
much) on rent. Or, total expenses of $2,500 for the month might see reason-
able, until you see a bar chart illustrating that that represents twice your
normal spending levels.

To display a graph, choose the appropriate graph command from the
Reports➪Graphs submenu. Quicken offers 14 graphs that cover cash flows,
investments, and your overall financial picture. Here’s a look at each of the
graphs:
✦Spending by Category displays a pie chart of total expenses entered for
each category actually assigned in the register (Figure 1-17). Use this
graph to try to identify where you might be over- or underspending.
✦Spending by Payee displays a pie chart of amounts you’ve paid to each
active payee. You might want to use this chart to zero in on overspend-
ing and to make choices about which businesses to patronize. For exam-
ple, you might be buying clothing, groceries, and hardware from a single
retailer, so you’d need to look at spending by payee rather than category
to get a sense of how much you’re spending at that retailer.
✦Current Spending versus Average Spending by Category presents a
bar chart of average spending by category for the current month and the
six prior months. If you have the sense that you’ve overspending across
the board for the month, compare the current month to the horizontal
line that charts average spending.
✦Current Spending versus Average Spending by Payee also presents a
bar chart of average spending for recent months, but calculates the
average by payee rather than category.

Remember, if you have a month with an unusual emergency expense,
your average figures might be distorted. If you experience such an
event, don’t give that month’s data as much consideration as you other-
wise would, or adjust the graph date range to try to eliminate the skew-
ing data.
✦Income and Expense by Category presents a bar chart with paired
bars — one showing income and the other expenses — for each time
interval charted. This graph can reveal how consistent your income is,
an important issue for people who are self-employed or living from
investment income. The graph shows total monthly values by default,
but you can view more detailed data by payee, as explained in the later
section called “Viewing data amounts.”
✦Income and Expense by Payee presents another graph with paired bars
that presents detailed data by payee rather than by category.
✦Budget graphically illustrates budget information you’ve set up in
Quicken, using paired bars to compare budget versus actual income and
expenses. (Book IV, Chapter 5 explains how to enter budget information
in Quicken.)
✦Monthly Budget charts the difference between expenses and income,
showing graphically whether you’ve had a favorable or unfavorable
(spent too much or earned too little) month financially.
✦Investment Asset Allocation is a pie chart that illustrates how you have
your money invested, by type of investment (large cap stocks, cash, and
so on). Use this tool to evaluate your mix of investments, so that you
can adjust the balance accordingly to reflect your changing needs and
risk tolerance.
✦Investment Performance shows a bar chart of the internal rate of return
(IRR) for investments, by month. This chart can help you identify up or
down periods or trends in the current year, so you can sell and buy
investments for better performance, if needed.
✦Portfolio Value, a pie chart, shows how much money you have invested
in each of your various investment accounts. You can use this tool, for
example, to determine whether to increase savings in taxable accounts
because your tax-deferred accounts aren’t growing quickly enough.
✦Portfolio Value and Cost Basis (Figure 1-18) presents a stacked column
chart that totals investment dollars held in each account, and uses line
graphs (with dots) to compare the cost basis (how much you paid for
the investments) versus the current value. Use this graph to evaluate
your investment performance based on dollar amounts rather than per-
centages. In Figure 1-18, the chart date range and intervals have been
changed from the defaults to chart more data.

Book VII
Chapter 1

QuickReports

583
For some of the bar charts, the default Interval is set to None, resulting
in a chart that shows a single bar of data. See the later section called
“Customizing a graph” to find out how to adjust this setting to make
your graph more meaningful.
✦Account Balances charts liability and debt (credit card) accounts
versus investment and bank account holdings, also charting the balance
between them. Review this graph to get a handle on whether your sav-
ings are growing faster than your debts.
✦Net Worth clarifies your overall bottom line. It uses a bar to compare
your assets versus your liabilities, and uses a dot (or line when charting
data over time) to identify your actual net worth. The higher the net
worth value, the more real wealth you have.
Viewing data amounts
Charts do a terrific job of summarizing and presenting data, but at times, you
may want to view the detail behind a pie slice, bar, or data point. You can use
the mouse pointer with the legend (the graph key at the upper-right corner)
and the chart elements to get more information about specific chart data.
For example, if a legend doesn’t include dollar values or percentages, move
the mouse pointer over a legend entry to display a pop-up box with the data
for that chart (legend) item. Figure 1-19 shows an example.

Similarly, you can point to a bar, slice, or point on the chart itself for a pop-
up display of the data (Figure 1-20).

If the mouse pointer changes to a magnifying glass when over a chart ele-
ment, double-click to open a window with the full listing of the data summa-
rized by that bar, slice, or point. For example, Figure 1-21 shows the assets
charted in the positive (above the 0 line) portion of the graph bar to the left
of the window.
In some cases, double-clicking a charted element displays another chart or a
report with the needed details. In such a case, you can click the Back button
on the Graph window toolbar to return to the original graph.
The Graph window also includes a Show Report button in the lower-right
corner. Click that button to include report data along with the graph (Figure
1-22), and then click the Hide Report button that appears to remove the
report detail from the Graph window.
Customizing a graph
The process for customizing a graph works just like changing the date 
range and adding subtotals to a report, as described earlier in the chapter.
You make choices from drop-down lists above the data, and then choose
whether to save the customized graph at the prompt that appears when you
close the Graph window.

The key difference between customizing a graph rather than a report is that
the customization options vary based on the type of graph displayed. All
graphs offer a Date Range drop-down list that enables you to specify what
overall time frame to chart. From there, the available choices vary. For exam-
ple, the Current Spending versus Average Spending by Category graph
(Figure 1-23) includes Compare To and Subtotal By controls in addition to
the Date Range drop-down list below the graph title.
Simply make the choices you want from the available controls to alter the
graph to present the data you need.
Printing a graph
When you open a graph in Quicken, the Print Graph button (refer to Figure
1-23) in the Graph window toolbar becomes active.
Click the button to open the Print dialog box. Chapter 4 of this book describes
printing in more detail. If you want to simply print with the default settings,
click the OK button in the Print dialog box.

ith typical screen settings, the register can only show a dozen or
fewer transactions onscreen at a time. Such limited data is of limited
use in terms of being a tool for planning and decision-making. And even if
you sort the transactions, the register can’t do things like tell you how 
much you spent in a particular category or over a particular time period.
Quicken’s comprehensive reports (and graphs) enable you to summarize
and analyze all your Quicken information, freeing you from the time-
consuming and mind-numbing work of finding and totaling transactions. In
this chapter, see how you can use Quicken’s Reports & Graphs Center to
view reports that give you financial insight, to work with transactions, and
to get quick answers to specific questions about your finances.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Reports
& Graphs Center
Personal financial reporting used to fall squarely in the domain of well-paid
financial advisors. After all, they were the ones who had the software and the
time to collate reams of information. Once the more meticulous among us
got our hands on basic spreadsheet software, we could — if so inclined —
spend our precious free time entering information from bank and investment
statements to do a little sorting and subtotaling. What fun. Why not go get a
root canal while we’re at it?
You can count on the inexpensive Quicken program to save you a heap o’
work when it comes to analyzing your income and investments. Quicken not
only offers dozens of reports and graphs, but it also organizes the reports
and graphs into an easy-to-access location called the Reports & Graphs

Familiarizing Yourself with the Reports & Graphs Center
590
Center. Figure 2-1 shows the Reports & Graphs Center, which you can open
by choosing Reports & Graphs from the Reports menu or by clicking the
Reports button on the Quicken tool bar.
The first time you display the Reports & Graphs Center or a report in
Quicken 2006, the What’s New in Quicken 2006 window might appear. Review
the information in the window, which covers new report features. If you want
to see more of what’s new, click the Show Full List of What’s New link in the
lower-left corner. When you finish working in the window, click the Exit
button in the upper-right corner.
To discontinue seeing What’s New windows, click the Don’t Show Me This
Again check box.
The left side of the Reports & Graphs Center displays the Quicken Standard
Reports list of the report (and graph) categories offered by Quicken. The My
Saved Reports list at the right organizes any custom reports that you save. You
can create custom folders to organize your reports in the My Save Reports list
(see the next chapter for a comprehensive discussion on customizing reports).
By the way, the Reports & Graphs Center essentially treats a graph as a
report, so I’ll stick with just referring to “reports” to simplify descriptions in
the chapter.

To see the reports in a particular category in the Quicken Standard Reports
list or in a folder in the My Saved Reports list, click the category or folder
name. As shown in Figure 2-2, the reports available in the category appear
below the category name. Click the triangle again to hide the reports in the
category. The next few sections explain how to display and work with
reports from the Reports & Graphs Center.
You can use the Reports & Graphs Center to view a single report at a time, or
you can leave the center open to work with multiple reports. You can click
the Minimize button (it’s the one that looks like a minus sign) in the upper-
right corner of the Reports & Graphs Center window to “park” the Reports &
Graphs Center as a button at the bottom of the Quicken window. Click the
Reports & Graphs button (Figure 2-3) to restore the Reports & Graphs
Center window. Any report you minimize also appears as a button at the
bottom of Quicken, as Figure 2-3 illustrates. Click the button to restore the
report window.
To close the Reports & Graphs Center window, click the X button in the
upper-right corner of the window.
Quicken’s reporting and graphing capabilities rely on the categories you
assign to transactions. Reports cannot include uncategorized transactions. If
you need to review what’s involved with creating and using categories, jump
back to Chapter 1 of Book II.

Using the Reports & Graphs Center looks pretty simple, because it is. Before
you move on to the equally un-tough task of opening an actual report, pause
for a moment to review the types of reports available to you in the report
categories:
✦Banking: This category contains five reports that enable you to review
basic, yet essential, information about one or more accounts. For exam-
ple, the Banking Summary report (Figure 2-4) groups the income, expense,
and transfer transactions from all cash flow accounts by category. This
report definitely can help you see where your money’s coming from and
where it’s going. The other reports in this category are the Cash Flow,
Missing Checks (which also lists all other transactions), Reconciliation,
and Transactions reports.
By default, Quicken includes transactions from all applicable accounts
when it displays a report. For example, the Transactions report in the
Banking category includes transactions from all cash flow and investing
accounts, whereas the Banking Summary report includes transactions
from all the cash flow accounts. To limit a report to display information
from a selected account only, to change the reporting period from the

default of Year to Date (YTD), and so on, you must customize the report
as described in the next chapter.
To see a description of any report in the Reports & Graphs Center, dis-
play the reports in the category, and then move the mouse pointer over
the report. A yellow pop-up tip appears to describe the report, as shown
in the example in Figure 2-5.
✦Spending: The Spending category includes two reports and several
choices with a graph icon beside them. When a graph icon appears
beside a listing in a report category, you can display either a report or a
graph, as shown in Figure 2-6. The Itemized Categories and Itemized
Payees group transactions from cash flow accounts by category or payee,
respectively. Several more reports analyze spending and income:
Spending by Category, Spending by Payee, Current Spending versus
Average Spending by Category, Current Spending versus Average
Spending by Payee, Income and Expense by Category, and Income and
Expense by Payee. Rather than showing you all transactions, these
reports help you zero in more precisely on how you’re either making or
spending your money. For example, the Spending by Payee report
(Figure 2-7) by default shows you how much you’ve paid to each payee
over the course of the current year to date (YTD). The Budget report
compares planned versus actual income and spending by category,
whereas the Monthly Budge report breaks out budgeted and actual
income and spending by both category and month.

The graphs available via the Reports & Graphs Center are for the most
part the same as the graphs described in the previous chapter.
✦Comparison: Most of the reports in this category basically compare
financial inflows and/or outflows over a particular time period. The first
two reports, Current Spending versus Average Spending by Category and
Current Spending versus Average Spending by Payee (Figure 2-8), can
help you determine if you’re exceeding your normal spending in a partic-
ular category or to a particular payee. The Cash Flow Comparison report
compares money inflows and outflows during two time periods (by
default, the current YTD and the prior year). Similarly, the Income and
Expense Comparison by Category and Income and Expense Comparison
by Payee reports compare income and expenses during two time periods.
The Profit and Loss Comparison report as well as some reports in the
Business category are part of the broader Quicken Home & Business ver-
sion and must be purchased to be unlocked (more on this version in
Chapter 1 of Book VIII). Click the Unlock Report button to purchase the
report for use.

✦Investing: The investing reports here enable you to check on the per-
formance of the investments you’re tracking with investment accounts
in Quicken. These reports provide information for decision-making, as
well as information that helps at tax time. For example, the Capital Gains
report calculates how much you’ve made on securities that you’ve sold
in the current YTD, so you can more easily report that gain. The
Investing Activity report (Figure 2-9) shows quarterly investment activ-
ity and income, as well as investment performance helpful in calculating
quarterly estimated tax payments. The Investment Asset Allocation
report shows you how much you’ve invested in various asset classes, so
that you can adjust your portfolio to reflect your risk tolerance, time
until retirement, and other needs. Other investment reports cover
Investment Income, Investment Performance, Investment Transactions,
Portfolio Value, and Portfolio Value and Cost Basis.
✦Net Worth and Balances: When you need to see the big picture, check
out the Account Balances and Net Worth reports. The former shows you
the total value of each account you’ve set up in Quicken. The Net Worth
report (Figure 2-10) totals your assets and liabilities from various
accounts and presents the bottom line. The Overall Total (defined as
your total assets less your total liabilities) calculated in this report is
a key measure of your overall financial health. Focus on growing this
number — by increasing your assets and reducing your liabilities — to
increase your wealth and security.

✦Tax: If you’re using Quicken’s standard categories and have set up any
custom categories to be associated with a particular tax form line item,
the reports in the Tax category calculate relevant tax data to help you
with the dreaded ordeal of doing your taxes. The Capital Gains report is
the same as the one in the Investing category. The Schedule A-Itemized
Deductions (Figure 2-11), Schedule B-Interest and Dividends, and
Schedule D-Capital Gains and Losses reports total transactions associ-
ated with tax line items on the applicable schedule. The Tax Schedule
report shows all tax-related transactions, grouped by tax form or sched-
ule. The Tax Summary Report groups tax-related transactions by
income, expense, and transfer. BTW, there is quite a bit more detail on
these tax repots in Book V.
✦Business: The Balance Sheet report presents a business-style evaluation
of your finances, showing your assets versus liabilities and equity. The
Cash Flow, Cash Flow Comparison, and Missing Checks reports are the
same as those appearing in categories described earlier. The remaining
business-only reports must be purchased and unlocked. From there, you
can use them within Quicken to track your small business finances.
✦EasyAnswer: The reports here help you answer plain English questions
about your finances. See the section later in this chapter called
“Checking Out an EasyAnswer Report” to discover more.

Methods for displaying a report
Quicken 2006 actually offers a number of different ways to start displaying a
report when you need it. You can work from the Reports & Graphs Center,
use the Reports menu, or even use the Quicken tool bar. Whichever method
you choose, you can display a powerful report in a matter of moments.
If you want to display a report from the Reports & Graphs Center, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪Reports & Graphs Center or click the Reports button
on the Quicken tool bar.
The Reports & Graphs Center window appears.
2. Click a category in the Quicken Standard Reports list or a folder in
the My Saved Reports list.
The reports in the category or folder appear in a list.
3. Click the report name.
The basic choices for setting up the report appear below the report name,
like the example in Figure 2-12. The options presented vary depending on
the report, but generally consist of drop-down lists for choosing a Date
Range, Payee, or Compare To (time period to compare to).
4. Choose the desired report settings from the drop-down lists below the
report name.
5. Click Show Report or Show Graph (refer to Figure 2-12) to open the
report.
The report appears in its own window onscreen, and from there, you can
change it and print it as described later in this chapter and in the next
two chapters.
When you choose the Reconciliation report from the Banking category,
Quicken immediately prompts you to print the report because this report
does not display onscreen. Click the Show Report button, enter a Report
Title in the Reconciliation Report Setup dialog box that appears, and then
click Print to send the report to the printer.
The Reports menu lists the same categories as in the Reports & Graphs
Center. To open a report, click the Reports menu, move the mouse pointer
over the category name, and then click the report in the submenu that
appears. For example, you would choose Reports➪Spending➪Spending by
Payee to open the Spending by Payee report. Note that when you use this
method, Quicken displays the report using default report settings rather
than prompting you to make choices as the Reports & Graphs Center does.

Displaying Reports
600
In some cases, the Register and Overview tabs for some accounts offer a
Reports menu. Click Reports to open a menu of reports (Figure 2-13) available
for that account. Click the report you want to display using default settings.
If you save a custom report, you can add a button for displaying that report
to the Quicken tool bar. To get the lowdown on this trick, see Chapter 4 of
Book VII.
Changing report contents
To make sure that you can review the information you need, Quicken
enables you to change some report settings within the report window
onscreen. The available choices appear at the top of the report window and
vary depending on the report you’re viewing. (These are the quick and dirty
settings. If you want to really dig into wrangling report information, skip on
to the next chapter in Book VII.)
In many cases, you might want to change the time period the report covers.
You can make this change by choosing a Date Range from the drop-down list
like the one shown in Figure 2-14. A few of the commands on the Date Range
drop-down list enable you to set up the report to show info from a specific
month, quarter, or year, or from other specific time periods. To get more
specifics about specifying the report Date Range, and so I don’t have to
repeat myself, see Chapter 1 of Book VII. That section also tells you how to
save a report with custom dates when Quicken prompts you.

Some reports might include other settings, such as an Interval setting. The
choices on the Interval drop-down list (Figure 2-15) tell Quicken how to total
information for the columns in the report. For example, if you choose Quarter,
the report totals a quarter’s worth of transactions for each column, rather
than totaling a month’s worth of transaction.
You can click the Show Graph button near the upper-right corner of the
report data, when it appears, to display a graph of the report information
above the data itself. If you decide you don’t need the graph, click the Hide
Graph button that subsequently appears to remove the graph.
Some reports also work in an outline fashion to present the information from
various accounts. When that’s the case, Expand All and Collapse All buttons
appear above the report data, and small minus sign buttons appear to the
left of each account name (Figure 2-16). Click the minus button beside an
account to collapse or hide its transaction, showing only the account name
and subtotal on a single line. Click the plus sign button beside a collapsed
entry to expand (redisplay) its transactions. To expand or collapse all the
transactions in the report, use the Expand All or Collapse All buttons at the
top. Collapsing data enables you to hide irrelevant stuff without having to
customize the report. Nifty!

Working with Report Transactions
Some programs are — pardon this rant — Dumb with a capital D when it
comes to reports. In such a program, the report might appear in its own
window and you might get to change a few print settings like margins, but
that’s it. You can’t really work with the data itself in any meaningful way.
Quicken reports, in contrast, remain flexible so that you can really use the
information, and even fix information. This section covers how to find and
change transactions in a report. Finding a transaction might be important if
you have a question about the transaction. And fixing a transaction that’s
wrong, well, the point of that is obvious.
Searching for information in a report
If you’ve ever used the Find and Replace capabilities in your word process-
ing program, this will be familiar. If you’ve read Chapter 2 of Book II, you’ve
probably been there and done this. In any case, it’ll still be a snap for you to
learn.
Figure 2-16:
Expand and
collapse

to stream-
line a long

Working with Report Transactions
604
Rather than scrolling through a lengthy report to find a transaction with the
right bit of information, you can find a transaction based on information (a
criterion) you specify. Quicken then spits back a list of matching transactions,
so you can zero in on the one of interest. For example, if you can’t remember
the check number for a check that you wrote to Cash on a particular date,
you can search for all transactions that have Cash in the Payee field.
The tool bar for every report window includes a Find & Replace button. Click
that button to open a Find and Replace window.
The Find and Replace window is the same Find and Replace window that
appears when you choose Edit➪Find & Replace➪Find/Replace from the main
menu.
Figure 2-17 shows the choices to make at the top of the window to find trans-
actions with Cash in the Payee field.
Here’s how to use each of these controls:
✦Look In: To specify what field Quicken should search, choose the field
from the Look In drop-down list, or leave All Fields selected to search all
fields.
✦Match If: Make a choice from the Match If drop-down list to make the
search more or less precise. For example, Exact tells Quicken to identify
only transactions that match exactly, whereas Contains returns any
Figure 2-17:

transaction that has a version of the word or phrase to find. Likewise,
Starts With and Ends With return partial matches. If you’re searching
based on a field that holds values (such as the Amount field), you can
use the Greater, Greater or Equal, Less, or Less or Equal choices to con-
trol how many matches Quicken returns.
✦Find: Type the word, phrase, or amount to match. If a drop-down list
arrow appears beside this text box, you can click it to see a list of exist-
ing Quicken entries for the field, so that you can click the one to match.
After you choose or enter the needed Look In, Match If, and Find informa-
tion, click the Find All button. The Found section of the Find and Replace
window lists all transactions that match the criterion you set up. Figure 2-18
show the transactions resulting from the Find entries shown in Figure 2-17.
From there, you can do a couple of things with the found transactions. You
can click the Print choice near the top of the window to open the Print
dialog box and send the list of matching transactions to the printer. If you’re
feeling really crazy, you can replace information in a transaction. Click the
check box for the transaction(s) to change in the Found list, so that a check
mark appears. Near the bottom of the window, specify the field holding the
data to replace using the Replace drop-down list. Then enter the replace-
ment information for the field in the With text box. Click the Replace button
to change the field information.
Done with the find and/or replace? Then click Done. Well done.

Jumping to a transaction in the register
Sometimes a report may include a transaction or total (depending on the
type of report you’ve displayed) that might look unfamiliar or downright
wrong. If you need to review a suspicious transaction in the register or want
to see the detail about the values Quicken added to create a particular total
for a category or payee, you can zoom in on the data.
When you’re working in the report, first click on the item or entry to zoom. 
If you click on an actual transaction, in most cases, the transaction is high-
lighted. If you instead click a calculated total for a category or payee, a black
outline appears around the item amount (Figure 2-19). In either case, move
the mouse over the transaction or item, so that the mouse pointer turns into
a magnifying glass. Then, double-click.
What happens next varies a bit depending on whether you zoomed a transac-
tion or a calculated amount. If you zoomed a single transaction, Quicken mini-
mizes the report, goes to the register that holds the transaction, and selects
the transaction there so that you can review it. To go back to the report from
which you zoomed, click the minimized report button below the register.
Note: When you’re working in some investment reports, zooming a transac-
tion might open a dialog box where you can edit that transaction, rather
than taking you to the register.

If you double-clicked a report value that Quicken calculated, Quicken instead
displays a QuickZoom report. This report lists the transactions that Quicken
totaled to yield the report value. For example, Figure 2-20 shows the
QuickZoom report resulting from double-clicking the report value shown in
Figure 2-19. The QuickZoom report works like the other reports described
in this chapter. You can change the basic report settings using the controls
at the top.
If you want to return to the report from which you zoomed, click the Back
button on the QuickZoom report window’s tool bar. Click the Forward button
from the original report to go back to the QuickZoom report. When you close
the QuickZoom report window, Quicken asks whether you want to save the
report, a topic covered in Chapter 4 of Book VII.
See Book VII, Chapter 1 to find out more about zooming from a graph. Note 
that if you Shift+click a bar or slice, Quicken hides it, so you must then re-create
the graph to redisplay the hidden bar or slice.

Selecting report items
Quicken 2006 introduces a great new feature for those who might be a bit lazy.
(Naw, not you!) In some reports, Quicken saves you the trouble of needing to
zoom to make a correction. In those types of reports (reports listing transac-
tions, as well as QuickZoom reports that itemize transactions for a particular
payee or category), you can select and make basic changes to a transaction.
But just as you have to select text or values to change in a word processing
or spreadsheet program, you have to select one or more transactions in a
report to be able to edit the transaction.
To select a single transaction to edit, click it in the report window. Quicken
displays a selection highlight across the full transaction.
If you want to select multiple transactions (Figure 2-21, top) that appear
sequentially, click the topmost transaction, press and hold the Shift key, then
click the bottommost transaction, and release the Shift key. To select multi-
ple non-sequential transactions (Figure 2-21, bottom), click the first transac-
tion, press and hold the Ctrl key, click additional transactions to select, and
then release the Ctrl key.
From there, you’re ready to edit the selected transaction(s) — or not. If you
decide to skip the edit operation and have selected multiple transactions,
simply click away from the selection, either on a single transaction or on
a blank area within the report window, and the transaction or group is
deselected.
Modifying transactions from a report
Inaccurate transaction in a report got you down? Then change it! You may
have already noticed that in most reports that list transactions, especially
QuickZoom reports that break down category or payee information, a new
Edit button appears above the report column headings. If you click the Edit
button, the menu that appears gives you choices for editing any transac-
tion(s) you’ve selected in the report using the methods described above.
Figure 2-22 shows the Edit button menu choices in a QuickZoom report that
breaks out the transactions in an expense category.
The Edit button menu choices change depending on the nature of the
selected transaction.
Changes you make using the Edit button menu choices apply in both the
report and the register, so be careful. For most transactions, you can click
one of the following menu choices to make a change:

Stop! Before you delete or change anything, you might want to back up your
Quicken data file. Jump over to Appendix A to learn how to do that deed.
With a solid data backup, you always can restore your prior data file if you
blew it and nuked a transaction or goofed up a change.
✦Delete Transaction(s): Click this choice in the menu to delete the
selected transaction(s). Quicken 2006 displays a message box prompting
you to confirm the deletion. Click OK, but only if you really want to
delete the selected transaction(s). You can’t undo a deletion.
✦Recategorize Transaction(s): Click this choice on the menu when you
want to change the Category field entry assigned to the selected trans-
action(s). Quicken displays the Recategorize transactions dialog box.
Click the Category drop-down list arrow, click the new category to
assign (Figure 2-23), and then click OK. (Rather than choosing a category
from the drop-down list, you also can type a new category, and then
Quicken asks you to click Yes to add the new category after you click OK
in the Recategorize Transactions dialog box.)

✦Rename Payee(s): If you entered or assigned the wrong payee name to
the selected transaction(s), or if the payee entity’s name has changed,
click this command to fix the situation. In the Rename Payee dialog box
that appears, click the Payee drop-down list arrow and click the desired
payee, or simply type a new payee in the Payee text box. Then click OK.
✦Edit Memo(s): This last Edit button menu choice enables you to add or
update the Memo field entry for the selected transaction(s). After you
click Edit memo(s), the Edit Memo dialog box appears. Type the new
memo text you want into the Memo text box, and then click OK.
If you’ve got a real eagle eye, you might have taken note of the fact that when
you’re dealing with a report that breaks out the transactions in a particular
category, the report window menu includes a Go to Category List choice so
that you can jump to the Category List window to make changes or additions.
Resolving a placeholder transaction
When it encounters a discrepancy, Quicken might insert a Placeholder Entry
(placeholder transaction) to resolve the account information. This typically
happens in investment accounts, where you specified a total number of
shares owned that doesn’t match up with the total number of shares from
share purchase transactions. Or, Quicken might add a placeholder transac-
tion to provide an estimated cost for securities purchased.
In a report window, Quicken identifies a Placeholder Entry by placing an aster-
isk (*) next to the placeholder value. In addition, a message near the bottom of
the report window alerts you to the Placeholder Entries. Figure 2-24 illustrates
both of these cues.
Figure 2-23:
Choose
the new
category to
apply to the
selected
trans-
action(s).

Working with Report Transactions
612
If you want to resolve a Placeholder Entry to ensure that your Quicken data
is as accurate as possible (a plus if you’re relying on Quicken for tax report-
ing), you can work directly from the report window, like this:
1. Click the Show Me link at the right end of the message about the
Placeholder Entries.
The Resolve Placeholder Entries window appears, listing the securities
for which Quicken has entered placeholder transactions.
2. Click the plus button to the left of a security name to expand its
transactions.
As shown in Figure 2-25, a link identifies the Placeholder Entry.
If you click the link for a security name in the Resolve Placeholder
Entries window, the Security Detail View window opens with more 
information about the security.
3. Click the Placeholder link.
The Enter Missing Transactions dialog box shown in Figure 2-26 opens.

4. Take a look at the information listed near the bottom of the dialog box
to determine what to do to resolve the transaction.
For example, the example shown in Figure 2-26 indicates that the
Placeholder Entry added two more shares of the security to account 
for a discrepancy between the number of shares currently owned and
the share purchase transactions entered in Quicken.
Figure 2-26:

Entry.

Working with Report Transactions
614
5. Based on what you see in step 4, use one of three methods to resolve
the transaction:
• If you determine that you simply entered the wrong number of shares
or cost information for a transaction, click the transaction in the trans-
actions list, and then click the Edit button beside it. An Edit dialog box
like the one shown in Figure 2-27 opens. (Its specific name changes
depending on the selected transaction.) Make the changes needed to
correct the transaction and resolve the Placeholder Entry, and then
click Enter/Done. For example, to resolve the discrepancy shown in
Figure 2-26, you could change the Number of Shares entry for the
transaction shown in Figure 2-27 from 28 to 30 (to account for the two
shares added by the Placeholder Entry), change the Total Cost entry, 
if applicable, and then click Enter/Done. If the Recalculate Investment
Transaction dialog box appears, click an option button to specify
whether Quicken should adjust the Price, Shares, Total Amount, or
Commission/Fee for the transaction to make the math work, and then
click OK to finish editing the transaction.
• If you determine that a transaction is missing overall and you have
accurate information about the missing transaction, click the Enter
Missing Transaction button near the bottom of the Enter Missing
Transactions dialog box. A Buy–Shares Bought dialog box, which
resembles the dialog box shown in Figure 2-27, appears. Enter the
transaction information, and then click Enter/Done. A message
window indicates that your new entry will not affect the share bal-
ance because the new transaction will replace the Placeholder Entry.
Click Yes to confirm your entry.
Figure 2-27:
Editing a

the

Book VII
Chapter 2
Quicken’s Standard
Reports

615
• If you determine that a transaction is missing but you don’t have
accurate cost or other information about it, click the Estimate
Average Cost button near the bottom of the dialog box. Quicken
opens the Enter Missing Transactions dialog box shown in Figure
2-28. Make sure that the As Of drop-down list shows the date for the
Placeholder Entry. Then enter the approximate Cost and Price/Share
information in those text boxes and click OK. Quicken assigns the
estimated cost information to the Placeholder Entry.
If you use the third method above to resolve the transaction, don’t rely
on Quicken alone to report tax information about the security involved.
That’s because you’ve just entered estimated information, not accurate
information, so Quicken’s calculations are affected accordingly.
6. Back at the main Enter Missing Transactions dialog box, the area
below the transactions list should (if you edited or added a transac-
tion) tell you that the Placeholder Entry now has 0 shares. Click the
Done button.
Quicken returns you to the Resolve Placeholder Entries window.
7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 to resolve any other placeholder entries listed.
8. Click the X button to close the Resolve Placeholder Entries window.
9. Back in the main Quicken window, click the minimized button for the
report that previously held the Placeholder Entries to redisplay
the report.
It should now be free of asterisks and the message about Placeholder
Entries.

Using the History and Report List
If you’ve displayed a QuickZoom report or have made changes to create
numerous versions of a report (see the next chapter), the report window
that you’re working in tracks the history of your actions. That Report
History enables you to back up to any previous report or version of a
report that you’ve viewed in the current report window.
When you’ve viewed more than one report in the current report window, the
History button on the tool bar becomes active. Click that button to open a
menu of previously viewed reports (Figure 2-29). This menu lists the reports
in the order that you displayed them, so the top report on the menu was the
first one you viewed. Click the name of the report to jump back to, which
redisplays the report.
If you get tired of using the History button, you can display the list of reports
you’ve viewed in a special pane at the left side of the report window. To
open the Report List, click the History button on the report window tool bar,
and then click Show Report List at the bottom of the menu (refer back to
Figure 2-29). The Report List appears, as shown in Figure 2-30. Click any
report in the list, and it reappears in a snap in the report window.
To close the Report List pane, click the Hide Report List button below the
reports in the pane, or click the History button and then click Hide Report
List.

Setting Defaults: Report Preferences
You’ve probably displayed quite a few reports while checking out the infor-
mation in this chapter, so you may have already noticed a similarity. By
default, each report uses a default Date Range of the year to date (the cur-
rent YTD). The Quicken program enables you to change this default setting,
as well as a few others, to cut down on your work in setting up reports and
graphs the way you want them to be.
Change report defaults in the Quicken Preferences dialog box. To start 
changing preferences for both reports and graphs, choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Quicken Program, and then click Reports and Graphs in the Select preference
type list at the left side of the Quicken Preferences dialog box. If you’re already
working in a report window, simply click the Preferences choice on the window
menu bar. Either way, you get to the overall preferences for Reports and
Graphs, shown in Figure 2-31.
The Select Preferences area at the right side of the Quicken Preferences dialog
box enables you to change five overall settings for reports and graphs. If
you’re not happy with the date ranges used for reporting and comparison,
make alternate choices from the Default date range and/or Default comparison
date range drop-down lists. If either of your choices require you to supply
custom dates, additional drop-down lists appear.

Down in the Customizing Reports and Graphs section, click an option to spec-
ify whether customizing creates a new report or graph or customizing modi-
fies a current report or graph. Note that making the latter choice doesn’t turn
off the history tracking in the report window. It means that Quicken only
prompts you to save the report you’re currently viewing in the report window.
In such a case, if you’ve created multiple reports that you want to save, use
the History button or the Report List to display each one, and then use the
Save Report button to save each one. Find out more about saving reports in
Chapter 4 of Book VII.
If you want to specify more detail for each report you create via the Reports
menu or Reports & Graphs Center, check the Customize Report/Graph Before
Creating check box. When that option is checked, Quicken automatically
opens the Customize dialog box when you create a new report so that you
can specify more detailed report settings.
If you want to drill down further in working with report defaults, click the
Reports Only choice in the Select Preference Type list at the left side of the
Quicken Preferences dialog box. The Select Preferences choices at the right
change as shown in Figure 2-32.
Click either the Description, Name, or Both option button under Account

If you’ve got only a black-and-white printer, clear the Use Color in Report
check box to eliminate color use, so the onscreen reports more realistically
matches the printouts you’ll get. Clear QuickZoom to Investment Forms to
turn off the QuickZoom capability for investment transactions such as buy
and sell transactions. You might want to do this to prevent yourself or
another user in your house from monkeying with investment transactions
and thus introducing errors.
If you don’t want Quicken to prompt you to save a report when you’ve
changed the Date range or another setting, clear the Remind Me to Save
Reports check box.
Finally, if you want Quicken to use more or fewer than three decimal places
for security prices and share amounts, edit the Decimal Places for Prices and
Shares entry accordingly.
When you think you’ve got it in terms of preference settings for reports and
graphs, click the OK button to close the Quicken Preferences dialog box and
apply the new preferences.
Checking Out an EasyAnswer Report
If you think some of the report names Quicken uses sound a little too esoteric,
Intuit has felt your pain and has adjusted Quicken accordingly. You can get
answers to some key questions about your financial health with EasyAnswer
reports.
Figure 2-32:
These
preferences
apply to
reports only.

Checking Out an EasyAnswer Report
620
Each EasyAnswer report uses a plain English question as its report name.
For example, if you’re wondering how much you spent on a particular type
of expense like auto fuel (a growing expense these days), you could use the
How Much Did I Spend On ? EasyAnswer report. If the term net worth stumps
you every time, just use the What Am I Worth? EasyAnswer report, instead.
To open an Easy Answer report, choose Reports➪EasyAnswer or click
EasyAnswer in the Quicken Standard Reports list at the left side of the
Reports & Graphs Center. The ten available EasyAnswer reports appear in
the list. Click the report to use, and its options appear below the report
name, as shown in Figure 2-33. In the case of the How Much Did I Spend On?
report shown in the figure, choose an expense category from the Show
Spending On drop-down list and a report time frame from the For the Period
drop-down list. From there, click the Show Report (or Show Graph) button,
and Quicken presents the EasyAnswer!
The EasyAnswer report that appears uses one of the other report names
because each EasyAnswer report is essentially a customized version of one
of the other reports, minus the propeller-head name. You can work with the
EasyAnswer report just as you would any other report.
If no transactions relate to a category, payee, or reporting period that you
specify for a report, the report window informs you that there are no match-
ing transactions. You can close the report window and return to the Reports
& Graphs Center to try the report using alternate settings.

A
s great as Quicken’s reports are, they aren’t perfect for every occasion.
For example, Quicken by default includes the data from every account in
every report. That’s hunky-dory, except if you want a report covering only a
single bank (cash flow) account. You know you can get an EasyAnswer report
about a single payee or category and that the regular reports cover all payees
and categories, but what if you need something in between? Well, I have good
news for you, my friend. Quicken enables you to customize reports in a vari-
ety of ways. Using the Customize Report Title dialog box, you can change such
settings as the report title, what columns a report shows, what bank accounts
it reports on, what categories and payees it covers, and even more. Does that
sound more like it? Good. In this chapter, I take a look at how to make a report
that covers what you want it to.
Opening the Customize Dialog Box
The Customize Report Title dialog box holds all the settings you can use to
change the information and layout used by the report. To open the Customize
Report Title dialog box, you can click the Customize button rather than the
Show Report or Show Graph button (Figure 3-1) when creating the report in
the Reports & Graphs Center. Or, if you created the report directly from the
Reports menu or decide after the fact to make a few changes, click the
Customize button on the report window tool bar. No matter how you got
there, the Customize Report Title dialog box appears.
This chapter is calling it the Customize Report Title dialog box because the
full name of the dialog box changes to reflect the title assigned to the report
you’re customizing.

Opening the Customize Dialog Box
622
The Customize Report Title dialog box offers several tabs of settings for 
changing the report. You can change the settings on a single tab and then click
OK. Or, if you want to change a variety of report settings, you can leave the
Customize Report Title dialog box open and work on as many tabs as needed
before clicking OK. The rest of this chapter explains the settings on each tab,
so you know exactly where to go if you only want to change a setting or two.
If the Customize Report Title dialog box doesn’t include an OK button, it
includes Show Report and/or Show Graph buttons. Click one of those to
display the customized report.
One last heads-up. The settings offered by the Customize Report Title dialog
box change slightly depending on the report type and sometimes depending
on other customization settings, as well. For example, the dialog box only
offers the settings for working with columns and sorting the report when
you’re working with a transaction report. So, if you can’t find a setting,
chances are it isn’t available for that type of report.

Customizing

Changing a Report Title
623
Changing a Report Title
A report title like Banking Summary — YTD may not inspire you to be a better
saver and a wiser spender, and Itemized Categories — YTD doesn’t work too
well if you’ve customized a report to cover only a single category. You can cus-
tomize any report title to use the text you want. Prefer John’s Power Banking to
Banking Summary — YTD? Change the report title. Does Petrol Spending sound
a whole lot more James Bond than Itemized Categories — YTD? Change the
report title.
The process for changing a report’s title starts just like the process for
customizing other report features. First, open the Customize Report Title
dialog box.
The control for changing the report title appears right on the first tab of the
dialog box, the Display tab. Make the desired title change in the Title text
box (Figure 3-2). You can either drag over the text box contents and type a
brand new title, or you can click in the text box and edit the existing entry
using the keyboard.
If you’re content with changing the report title alone, click OK to open the
new report or turn to the report window. As the example in Figure 3-3 shows,
the new title appears below the window tool bar, and it also appears when
you print the report. (Check out the final chapter in this Book VII, Chapter 4,
to bone up on printing reports.)
Figure 3-2:
Enter a new

of the

Changing the Reporting Time Frame
624
In this example, the report title was customized for a report that is based on
a single account. You can make your report titles specific like this or more
fun as your needs dictate.
Changing the Reporting Time Frame
Most reports and graphs give you the option of changing the reporting period
or date range with controls that appear in the report window itself, right
above the report data. If you’ve already got the Customize Report Title dialog
box open, you can change the date range for the report right in there, too.
The Date Range drop-down list appears at the top of the Customize Report
Title dialog box and is visible no matter what tab in the dialog box you’ve
selected. Open the Date Range dialog box, and click on the overall setting to
use. If other controls appear to enable you to specify more detail, make
entries and choices as needed. For example, Figure 3-4 shows the settings
that restrict the reporting period to the month of June, 2005.
So that this book doesn’t become a broken record, you can jump back to
Chapter 1 of Book VII to review how to use each of the Date Range settings
Quicken offers for reports.

Chapter 3
Customizing
Reports
Sorting Report Information
625
Note: For comparison reports, the Customize Report Title dialog box includes
controls for you to specify two time periods to compare for the report.
Sorting Report Information
By default, Quicken sorts the information in a transaction report by
Account/Date. That means that Quicken first groups the transaction by
account, and then sorts the transactions by date within each account group.
That’ll work on a bad day.
When you’re really looking at the nitty-gritty of how you manage your
money, however, it might be useful to arrange your transactions in another
way. For example, it might be more constructive to sort by the Amount field
if you want to see what transactions you spent the most money on.
Quicken actually gives you two different ways to change the sort method on
the report. You can click a column heading in the report itself to sort by that
column. A triangle appears beside the column heading for the column cur-
rently used to control the sort, as shown in Figure 3-5. Some columns just
aren’t sort-friendly (Memo columns, for example), so if you click and nothing
happens, Quicken doesn’t offer sorting for that column.
Unlike some other programs where you can sort by column heading and
then click the column heading a second time to reverse the sort order,
Quicken only enables you to sort in one direction.
Figure 3-4:
To show a
report for

only, choose
a Monthly
Date Range
and then
select Jun
05 from the
second
drop-down
list that

Sorting Report Information
626
The other way to sort, of course, is via the Customize Report Title dialog box.
When you’re working with a report with transactions that can be sorted, the
Display tab of the dialog box includes a Sort By drop-down list. Open that
drop-down list and click one of these sort orders:
✦Account/Date (the default): Groups transactions alphabetically by
account, and then sorts from least recent to most recent by date within
each group. Also groups first by account type if the report covers infor-
mation from different types of accounts.
✦Date/Account: Groups transactions first by date (least recent to most
recent), and then by account type, and lastly alphabetically by account
name.
When you sort by a field that includes words and phrases, like an
Account name, Payee, Category, or Description field, Quicken always
sorts in ascending alphabetical order; that is, from A to Z rather than
from Z to A.
✦Account/Check #: Groups accounts first by type and then by name, and
then sorts by check number within each group. Transactions without a
check number or with an entry like ATM in the Num field are listed as
a group either before or after the numbered items.
Figure 3-5:

column

Book VII
Chapter 3
Customizing
Reports
Controlling Subtotal Options
627
✦Amount: Sorts based on the entries in the Amount field, listing transac-
tions from lowest to highest in terms of the amounts.
Keep in mind the fact that the larger a negative number is, the lower that
number appears on that great number line in the sky. Thus, when you’re
sorting a report by amount and that report includes expenses, it’s going
to look like your sort is working from the largest number to the smallest,
when actually it’s working from the smallest number (which is to say the
largest negative number) to the largest positive number. If that doesn’t
make sense, don’t complain to me — write a letter to your third-grade
math teacher and ask for a refresher course.
✦Payee: Sorts based on the entries in the Payee field.
✦Category: Sorts based on the entries in the Category field.
Controlling Subtotal Options
The settings for “subtotaling” report information get a little hairy because
they differ quite a bit for different report types. And in some cases, a setting
you choose doesn’t exactly subtotal the data, but instead rearranges it. That
being said, take a look at the settings for subtotaling and organizing the
report information that appears on the Display tab of the Customize Report
Title dialog box.
For most transaction reports, you can work with the Organization drop-down
list and the Show section settings to control report information. The default
choice from the Organization drop-down list is Income & Expense, which
divides transactions into distinct Income, Expenses, and Transfer sections 
in the report. In contrast, the Cash Flow Basis choice divides transactions
into Inflows and Outflows sections (refer to Figure 3-6), with transfers out
of the account (such as transfers into a related asset account) included in
the Outflows section. For budget, comparison, and summary reports, the
Organization drop-down list may include a Category Group choice that
subtotals by category group rather than one of the other two methods just
described.
Because some of these subtotal/organization settings might have a subtle or
unexpected impact in a report, you might try changing one at a time and
then clicking the OK button to see the results in the report. That way, if you
don’t like the result of a change, you can go back to the Customize Report
Title dialog box to reverse it immediately.
If you’ve created multiple budgets, use the Budget drop-down list that
appears on the Display tab in the Customize Report Title dialog box to
choose the budget to use for the report.

When you’ve turned on multicurrency support in Quicken’s Preferences
(Chapter 1 of Book III includes a look at using the multicurrency feature in
Quicken), the Display tab of the Customize Report Title dialog box includes a
Currency drop-down list. You can open the drop-down list (Figure 3-7) and
click another currency to have Quicken recalculate all the report values and
present them in the newly specified currency. You might need to make such
a change if you have a second home overseas and want to track expendi-
tures on that location in both currencies, or if you have some income from a
source other than the United States.
In the Show section of the Display tab (also in Figure 3-7), clear the Cents (No
Rounding) check box to round dollar values to whole numbers in the report.
Check the Totals Only check box to eliminate the display of individual trans-
actions and instead display only totals and subtotals in the report.
If some of the transactions in the report have been split between categories, a
Breakdown of Split Trans. check box also appears in the Show section. Check
that check box to have the report display the full breakdown of the transaction
by category, rather than simply displaying a single line item with --Split-- in the
Category field. Figure 3-8 shows an example of a split transaction breakdown.

Summary and comparison reports offer some alternate customization set-
tings. For example, the Display tab for the Customize Banking Summary
dialog box includes a Headings section. Make a choice (Category, Class,
Payee, or Account) from the Row drop-down list there to control how to
select and subtotal the information on each row in the report. To break out
the report information over multiple time periods, make a choice from the
Column drop-down list. The settings from the Display tab of the Customize
Banking Summary dialog box shown in the top of Figure 3-9 result in the
report subtotaling and organization shown at the bottom.
For other summary reports, such as the Portfolio Value and Cost Basis
report, the Headings section of the Display tab includes an Intervals drop-
down list, so that you can choose the intervals (and therefore the number
of columns) for the report data. Or, the Headings area for a report like the
Portfolio Value report might include a Subtotal By drop-down list, so that
you can choose whether the report subtotals by Account, Security Type,
Asset Class, and so on. You also might see an Amount As % check box.
Select it to display percentages for report subtotals rather than dollar
values.
Turning on multicurrency support
If you need to track your accounts and invest-
ments in foreign currencies, you can turn on
Quicken’s multicurrency feature. This feature
enables you to track accounts and investment
purchases, sales, and earnings in different cur-
rencies; transfer money between accounts of
differing currencies; update the exchange rate
in your Quicken program; and create reports in
the currency of your choice.
Turn on the multicurrency feature by following
these steps:
1. Click Edit➪Preferences from the Quicken
menu, and then choose Quicken Program
from the side menu.
The Quicken Preferences window appears.
2. Click on the Setup heading to display the
list of headings beneath Setup.
3. Click on Calendar and Currency.
4. Select the Multicurrency Support check
box.
5. Click OK.
If you ever want to turn off Multicurrency
Support, just follow the steps above, and then
uncheck the Multicurrency Support check 
box.

Finally, the comparison report settings throw a couple of last curve balls 
at you. As shown in Figure 3-10, the Show section of the Display tab in the
Customize Report Title dialog box for these reports includes Difference as 
% and Difference in $ check boxes. Check these check boxes as needed to
show the differences in percentages, dollars, or both.

Selecting Specific Columns
632
Selecting Specific Columns
You might think you’ve had your fill of hearing so much about report cus-
tomization by now, but the worst really is over. This section breezes through
how to control the field columns that appear for a transaction report.
Selecting and resetting columns
When you’re working with a transaction report such as the Itemized
Categories report, the Display tab of the Customize Report Title dialog box
includes a Show Columns section at the right. Each of the columns listed in
the Column list in that section corresponds with a field from the register. By
default, all columns are selected on many reports. If you don’t need to see a
particular bit of information on your transactions report, click the check box
for that column (field) in the Column list to clear the check box, and this
removes the column from the report.
For example, in Figure 3-11 the Memo and Clr column check boxes have been
unchecked. That means the information from those fields will not be shown
in the report when you close the Customize Report Title dialog box.
The contents of the Description column change depending on the types of
transactions being reported. For example, for transaction reports about cash
flow accounts, the Description column shows the Payee information.
After you play with this capability, you’ll see that hiding a column cuts down
on extra white space in a report and makes the report more readable. So, for
example, if you don’t typically add a Memo field entry for your transactions,
Figure 3-10:
A compar-
ison report
can show
differences
in percent-
ages,
dollars, 
or both.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Customizing
Reports
Selecting Specific Columns
633
you should definitely hide the Memo column in your report. Figure 3-12
shows the Itemized Categories report with the Memo and Clr fields hidden
(the settings from Figure 3-11) to give you some idea of the difference that
controlling columns can make.

Figure 3-11:

Column list

column in
the report.

Selecting Specific Columns
634
If you want to show all the columns again, reopen the Customize Report Title
dialog box from the report window. You can either recheck all the check
boxes in the Column list, or simply click the Reset Columns button.
If you’ve already set up a report to show only transactions from a particular
account as described later under “Selecting Specific Accounts,” it makes
sense to hide the Account column and simply add the account name to the
report title for a more streamlined report. Similarly, if you limit the report to
cover more specific categories or payees (see “Choosing Report Categories
or Payees”), hide the Description or Category columns and let the title
reflect what the transactions show.
Changing column width
You have a little bit more control over columns in a transaction report. You
actually can resize columns in the report window. For example, refer back to
Figure 3-12 for a moment. The report looks pretty streamlined, but most of the
entries in the Account and Description columns appear cut off at the right.
The . . . (ellipsis) to the right of a column or field entry clues you in to the
fact that Quicken has had to cut off the information because the column is
too narrow. You can fix this type of problem by resizing the column to make
it wider. Use this technique to change the column width:
1. Move the mouse pointer over the double-line divider to the right of
the column heading for the column you want to resize.
2. After the mouse pointer changes to a split pointer (with horizontal
arrows and a double-vertical line), drag to the left or right to adjust
the column size, as illustrated in Figure 3-13.
Remember that “dragging” means to press and hold the left mouse
button, move the mouse around, and then release the mouse button.
If you press and release (click the mouse button), that won’t change
anything if you’re trying to resize a column.
3. When the column reaches the width you want, release the mouse
button. Figure 3-14 shows how the Account and Description column
entries look once those columns have been widened.
As Figure 3-14 illustrates, even widening the columns may not make for a
perfect report. You still may want to go back and hide some additional
columns. Also, you need to be aware that making the columns wider (or
smaller) also changes the overall width at which the report will print. You
should therefore preview the report printout after you’ve made changes to
the report columns, and change the report to use the Landscape (wide page)
print orientation, if needed. If you jump ahead to the next chapter, you’re
covered on these operations.

Selecting Specific Accounts
636
Selecting Specific Accounts
Most Quicken users have savings and checking accounts, at a minimum, that
they track in their Quicken file. Add in a credit card account or two, a retire-
ment account, an investment account, and any asset accounts, and you
quickly can wind up with a file that tracks thousands of transactions.
As I touched on in this chapter and the last, each Quicken report by default
includes the transactions from all the accounts set up in your Quicken file.
Although that might be OK in most instances because Quicken itself disre-
gards investment account transactions when creating a banking (cash flow)
report and vice versa, there may be instances where you want to exercise
your option to limit the number of accounts included in a report.
For example, if you want to view the missing checks from a single checking
account, to reduce confusion you should customize the Missing Checks
report to pull data only from that particular checking account. Similarly, if
you want to see the investment results for your mutual fund account only
(excluding information from your brokerage, 401(k), IRA, and other invest-
ment accounts), customize the Investment Performance account to show
only the data from your mutual fund account.
Use these steps to select the accounts to include in the report from within
the Customize Report Title dialog box:
1. Click the Accounts tab.
2. If any accounts are not visible and you want to include them in your
report, click the Show (Hidden Accounts) check box to display the
accounts.
3. If you want to work with only the accounts in a particular account
group, click the desired group in the Select Account Group area at the
left side of the tab (Figure 3-15).
4. Select the check boxes of those accounts you want to include in the
report, and leave the check boxes of those accounts you want to omit
blank.
Click the Mark All button to check (include) all available accounts from the
current group. On the other hand, the fastest way to select a single account
from the group is to click the Clear All button, and then click the check
box for the single account to include in the report, checking that account
alone.

Reports
Choosing Report Categories or Payees
637
Choosing Report Categories or Payees
The Categories and Payees tabs in the Customize Report Title dialog box
enable you to control a report’s scope by indicating which categories or
payees the report should cover. Because both these tabs work in an identi-
cal fashion, you can find out about this once and only once here.
On each tab, you have the option of limiting the report information via
selecting categories or matching specific information.
The left side of the tabs include the selection section: Select Categories on
the Categories tab and Select Payees on the Payees tab. As Figure 3-16
shows, you can include or exclude report categories or payees by checking
and unchecking items in the list. (The Payees tab lists payees rather than
categories.) Use the Expand All and Collapse All buttons to expand and 
collapse the list as needed. Of course, the Mark All button checks all the 
list items, and the Clear All button unchecks everything. To scroll quickly 
to a category or payee in the list, start typing its name in the Type Category/
Payee Name to Search List text box. The list immediately scrolls to show that
category or payee.
If you don’t want to mess with clearing the check boxes for all the categories
or payees, and you know what category (or subcategory) or payee you want
to cover in the report, you can leave all the categories or payees checked
and instead use the Matching section at the right.
Figure 3-15:

Accounts

Choosing Report Categories or Payees
638
When you’re working on the Categories tab, select a payee from the Payee
drop-down list to shown only transactions using a particular payee. To limit
the report to a particular category or subcategory, type the category or sub-
category name in the Category Contains text box. To limit the report to show
only transactions with a particular Memo field entry, type the applicable
entry in the Memo Contains text box. Using Matching, the entries shown in
Figure 3-17 would limit the report to list only transactions with Ingles as the
Payee and Food:Groceries as the specified Category (subcategory).
To specify a subcategory, type the category name, a colon, and then the sub-
category name, as in Utilities:Cable TV. No spaces immediately before or
after the colon!

The Matching settings on the Payees tab work almost identically. Choose a
category from the Category drop-down list and type match entries into the
Payee Contains and Memo Contains text boxes. Figure 3-18 shows an exam-
ple of matching on the Payees tab. Matching transactions have Pets specified
as the Category and Target specified as the Payee.
The Category, Payee Contains, and Memo Contains text boxes also will make
a match if you enter only a partial name or phrase. For example, you could
enter Tar rather than Target in Figure 3-18, and the report would still include
all transactions with Target as the Payee. However, if you enter such a partial
term, the report includes other matching transactions, too. Quicken also
would return transactions using Tarheel, Tarpon, Mortar, or any other varia-
tion of “tar” in the Payee field.
Other Customization Settings
The publishers of Quicken want you to be able to customize a report as
needed; they really do. But it might seem like you actually have too many
choices when you discover that certain other tabs can appear in the
Customize Report Title dialog box, depending on the type of report you’re
working with. With any luck, this streamlined presentation helps you work
with the additional tabs that can appear in the Customize Report Title
dialog box:
✦Classes: If you’ve created classes in Quicken, you can use this tab to
control which classes the report displays. Clear a check box to hide that
class in the report.
Figure 3-18:

Other Customization Settings
640
✦Category Groups: Budget, comparison, and summary reports include
this tab, shown in Figure 3-19. To exclude the transactions falling within
a particular category group from the report, clear that category group’s
check box in the Category Group list.
✦Actions: For some investment accounts, such as the Investment
Transactions report, you may see an Actions tab for customization. The
Action list here identifies the different kinds of actions represented by
account transactions, including such entries as Bought (buying shares of
a security), Div (a dividend received), IntInc (interest income), and so
on. Click the check box for an action in the list to clear its check box
(excluding those transactions from the report) or select its check box
(including its transactions in the report).
Clicking the Mark All or Clear All buttons always marks (check) or clears
(uncheck) all the items in a list of customization choices.
✦Securities: This tab (Figure 3-20) appears for investment reports and
some business reports, enabling you to exclude or include transactions
about a particular security in the report. As with the similar customiza-
tion settings, click to clear and check the check box for any security to
exclude or include, respectively, in the Security list. If you want to limit
the list to only a matching security, type the security’s name in the
Security Contains text box in the Matching section of the tab. Even
better, if you want to exclude everything but securities with similar
names (such as the securities in a particular mutual fund family), 
enter a partial name in the Security Contains text box.

✦Security Types: If you’re interested in having an investment or business
report show only particular types of securities, use the Security Types
tab. You know the drill: Clear and select check boxes in the Type list to
control what types of securities appear in the report.
✦Investment Goals: The last way to slice and dice investment data is by
investing goals on the Investing Goals tab. Check and uncheck items in
the Goal list as needed to control report contents.
Quicken may include even more report customization settings if you buy,
unlock, and download more of the business reports. Click the Unlock Report
button that appears after you click the desired report to start the process
for purchasing it. 
Using Advanced Settings
The final tab that appears in the Customize Report Title dialog box for most
report types is the Advanced tab. The settings on this tab (Figure 3-21) vary
widely, and weirdly enough, the tab appears for some report types — but
includes no settings or controls.
Figure 3-21 specifically shows the settings you get for many transaction
reports. In the Transactions section, you can make a choice from the Amounts
drop-down list to tell the report to show transactions with only certain dollar
amounts. For example, if you choose Greater Than from the Amounts drop-
down list and then enter 100 in the text box that appears, the report displays
transactions only with an entry of more than $100 in the Amount field.
Figure 3-20:
You can limit

Using Advanced Settings
642
Still in the Transactions section, check the Include Unrealized Gains check
box to include “paper” gains from securities not yet sold in a report showing
investment gains. Check Tax-Related Transactions Only to limit the report
to transactions with a tax-line-linked category or subcategory assigned. Or,
limit the report to show only Payments, Deposits, or Unprinted checks by
making the appropriate choice from the Transaction Types drop-down list.
The Status box on the tab lists check boxes representing various transaction
status entries. To exclude transactions marked with a particular status from
the report, clear the check box beside the status: Not Cleared, Newly
Cleared, or Reconciled.
At the bottom of the tab, make a choice from the Transfers drop-down list
to control whether all or some transfer transactions should be excluded from
the report. Determine whether to include or exclude transactions with a
subcategory assigned by making the desired choice from the Subcategories
drop-down list. Check the Show Me Change Alerts for This Report check box
at the bottom, and Quicken alerts you if you’re opening a saved report and
have added new categories, classes, or securities that you may need to
add to the report manually by changing customization settings.
Budget reports include one last option, a Categories drop-down list. To limit
the categories reported, choosing Non-Zero Actual/Budgeted throws out any
category that’s not used in the register or the budget you’ve set up, whereas
choosing Budgeted Only includes only categories used in the budget you set
up in the Budget dialog box.
Note: Quicken Premier Home & Business includes some additional Advanced
customization settings. Refer to the Help system for more information if you
upgrade to that version of Quicken.

T
he last chapter gave you quite a taste of the dozens of choices you can
make to customize a report or graph. Got them all memorized yet? I
didn’t think so. Fortunately, you don’t have to remember all the settings you
used to create the perfect custom report. After you’ve set up the report and
it looks good to you, you can save the custom report so that you can open it
again in the future as the information in your Quicken file changes. In this
chapter, you see how Quicken enables you to manage and access your
saved reports using folders and the Quicken tool bar. You also find out how
to convert report data to another format for use in another program, and
how to make perfect printouts of your report information.
Saving and Organizing Reports
When you first learned about Quicken’s Reports & Graphs Center in Chapter
2 of Book VII, you saw that it features a special area at the right called My
Saved Reports. Not surprisingly, that’s the location in Quicken where you
can store and organize your saved custom reports for easy access at a later
time. You can create custom folders to hold different types of reports, save
and open reports, and manage the reports that you’ve saved by moving
them to another folder or deleting them if they’re no longer needed.
When you open the Reports & Graphs Center for the first time, the My Saved
Reports list is completely empty, as shown in Figure 4-1. Read on to find out
how you can fill it up!

Saving and Organizing Reports
644
Creating a report folder
Most users accumulate quite a few custom saved reports over time. Just as
the Quicken Standard Reports list in the Reports & Graphs Center groups
reports by category so that you can jump to the report you want much more
quickly, organizing your many custom reports in the My Saved Reports list
into logical groups keeps each report within easy reach.
To accommodate both meticulous pre-planners and people who fly by the seat
of their pants, Quicken provides two ways to create folders to hold reports. If
you fall into the meticulous category, you might want to plan out what folders
you need and add them in advance. For example, if you know you plan to use
Quicken to manage both bank accounts and investments, you could create
folders named My Custom Banking Reports and My Custom Investing Reports
before even creating any reports. If you want to create custom report folders
in advance, from the My Saved Reports list, follow these steps:
1. Open the Reports & Graphs Center.
The fastest way to open the Reports & Graphs Center is to click the
Reports button on the Quicken tool bar.
2. Click on the Manage Saved Reports button at the bottom of the My
Saved Reports list.
The Manage Saved Reports dialog box (Figure 4-2) appears.

3. Click the Create folder button near the upper-left corner of the

The Create New Report Folder dialog box appears.
4. Type a name for the new folder in the Name text box of the Create
New Report Folder dialog box.
Figure 4-3 shows an example.
Your report folder name can have up to 39 characters, including spaces.
This challenges you to stick with snappy but descriptive folder names.
5. Click OK.
The new folder appears in the Manage Saved Reports dialog box. And, if
it’s the first folder that you’ve added, Quicken also adds the No Folder
area (Figure 4-4), which holds any custom reports that you don’t store in
a specific folder.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 to add other folders, as needed.
7. Click Done to close the Manage Saved Reports dialog box.
If you’re not big on pre-planning, that’s fine, too. You can create a folder
during the process of saving a custom report. Without digging too deep into
that process (because that discussion is coming up next), you can click the
Create Folder button in the Save Report dialog box to open the Create New
Report Folder dialog box shown in Figure 4-3. As described in steps 4 and 5
above, type the folder name and click OK. From there, you can finish saving
your custom report.
Saving a report
Any time you change report settings as described in the prior chapter, you
are creating a custom report as far as Quicken is concerned. If you’ve
changed a lot of settings for the report and think that you may want to use
that report again, you should save the custom report to add it to the My
Saved Reports list in the Reports & Graphs Center. That way, you can redis-
play the report any time you need it rather than having to remodify one of
Quicken’s standard reports.
You also can save and manage custom graphs using the same steps as
described from here on in the chapter.
Chapters 2 and 3 of Book VII both touched on the fact that when you change
report settings such as the reporting time frame (Date Range) and then close
the report window, a Save Report As dialog box asks whether you want to
save the customized report. You can either wait until Quicken prompts you
to decide to save, or you can initiate the save on your own. The following
steps for saving a report cover both methods of saving:

OR
1b. When you close the report window and the Save Report As dialog box
appears (also in Figure 4-5), click the Save button.
If you prefer not to save the report and still want to close the report
window, click the Don’t Save button in the Save Report As dialog box. To
leave the report window open without saving, click the Cancel button.
2. In the Save Report dialog box that appears (Figure 4-6), edit the entry
in the Report Name text box, replacing the default name of the report.
3. Enter an optional description for the report in the Description text box.
Quicken forces you to keep the Description text box entry short and
sweet — you’re limited to 21 characters.

previously, open the Save In drop-down list, and then click the name
of the folder to use.
5. Click OK.
Quicken saves the report in the Reports & Graphs center. If you started
the save while in the process of closing the report window, Quicken then
closes the report window.
Opening a custom report
Quicken offers multiple ways to perform many of its actions, including dis-
playing a custom report when you need to use it again.
✦Method #1 involves using the menu bar from the main Quicken window.
Open the Reports menu and point to the My Saved Reports & Graphs
choice. A submenu appears. If the report you want to open appears on
the submenu (because you didn’t save it in a particular folder), click the
report name. If you put the report in a folder that you created earlier,
point to the folder name (Figure 4-7), and then click the report. It opens
directly in its own window.
“Pointing” to something onscreen means that you should move your
mouse pointer over the item. In Method #1, for example, you don’t have
to click on the My Saved Reports & Graphs menu choice — just placing
your mouse pointer over the choice causes the side menu to appear.
✦Method #2 applies if you’re already working in the Reports & Graphs
Center. You can open the custom report from the My Saved Reports list
there. If you saved the report in a particular folder, click the folder name
to expand the list of reports stored in that folder. Click the name of
report to open (Figure 4-8), adjust the Date range (or any other setting
presented by Quicken), and then click Show Report. The report appears
onscreen in its own window.
If you just saved a custom report or graph and don’t find it in the Reports &
Graphs Center, you may need to close the Reports & Graphs Center window
and then reopen the window to ensure that the report shows up in the My

If you open a custom report, you can use the Customize button on the report
window’s tool bar to make further changes to the report. When you subse-
quently close the report window, the Save Changes to Report Name dialog
box appears. Click the Save button to save your latest changes to the existing
custom report, or click the Save As button to open the Save Report so you can
save the report under a new name, thus preserving the original custom report.

Managing saved reports
If you realize you blew it and saved a report in the wrong folder, if you want
to change a folder or report name, or if you don’t need a particular report
any longer, no problemo. The Manage Saved Reports dialog box available via
the Reports & Graphs Center enables you to tweak report and folder names
and trim out deadwood reports.
To open the Manage Saved Reports dialog box, click the Managed Saved
Reports button at the bottom of the My Saved Reports list in the Reports &
Graphs Center. The Manage Saved Reports dialog box appears, listing your
custom folders and any custom reports not saved in a particular folder. The
five buttons along the left side of the dialog box (Figure 4-9) enable you to
manage folders and reports in these ways:
✦Create Folder: Use this button to create even more folders, as described
earlier in the chapter.
✦Move to Folder: This button lets you move a particular report out of one
folder and into another. To make the move, first click the folder that cur-
rently holds the report so that you can see the report to move. Click on
the report, and then click the Move to Folder button. Open the Name
drop-down list in the Move to Report Folder dialog box that appears,
click the name of the folder that will be the “new home” of the custom
report (Figure 4-10), and then click OK.
You also can initiate a few report changes directly from the My Saved
Reports list in the Reports & Graphs Center. Click the folder name in the
list so that you can see the report name, and then right-click the report
name. The shortcut menu that appears gives you the option to Delete,

Edit, or Move to (move the report to) another folder. Similarly, right-click
a folder name to see a shortcut menu offering New, Delete, and Rename
commands.
✦Rename Folder: If you botched naming a folder, click the folder in the
list in the dialog box, and then click the Rename Folder button. Type a
new name or edit the existing name in the Name text box of the Rename
Report Folder dialog box that appears, and then click OK.
✦Edit: Rather than actually enabling you to recustomize a custom report,
this choice enables you to change a custom report’s name and descrip-
tion. Click the folder that holds the report to change, click the report
name itself, and then click the Edit button. In the Edit Saved Report
dialog box that appears, change the entries in the Report name and
Description text boxes, and then click OK.
✦Delete: You can delete both reports and folders using the Delete button.
To delete a folder or report, select the deletable item in the Manage Saved
Reports dialog box, and then click the Delete button. Click OK in the warn-
ing message box (Figure 4-11) that appears to continue with the deletion.
Be really sure before you click OK because you can’t retrieve a deleted
report or file. Also, if you try to delete a folder that has reports in it, Quicken
won’t continue with the deletion. You need to move or delete all the reports
in the folder before you can delete that folder.

Adding Reports to the Tool Bar
652
After you’ve finished making the changes you want, click the Done button at
the bottom of the Manage Saved Reports dialog box to close the dialog box
and return to the Reports & Graphs Center.
Adding Reports to the Tool Bar
The tool bar in the main Quicken window provides some convenient short-
cuts. Even better, as you may have discovered earlier, you have some control
over what buttons appear on the tool bar to make your most vital Quicken
operations even faster and easier. You can add a button to the Quicken tool
bar for your favorite custom report, or for a custom folder holding one or
more custom reports. This technique gives you quick and direct access to
your reports.
Adding the report
You can initiate the process of adding a custom report (or folder with multi-
ple reports) to the tool bar from three different directions:
✦Choose Edit➪Customize Tool Bar. Next click the Manage Tool Bar Reports
button in the lower-left corner of the Customize Tool Bar dialog box that
appears.
✦Choose Reports➪My Saved Reports & Graphs➪Add Reports to tool bar.
✦Click the Manage Tool Bar Reports button at the bottom of the My Saved
Reports list in the Reports & Graphs Center.
Any of those three routes opens the Manage Tool Bar Reports dialog box,
which lists the custom folders and reports that you created earlier. As Figure
4-12 shows, you can add either individual reports or entire folders to the
tool bar. To add the folder and all the reports in it to the tool bar, click the
check box beside the folder name to check it. To add an individual report
directly to the tool bar (without a folder), click the folder name (not the
check box) so that you can see the reports in the folder, and then click the
check box beside the report to add to the tool bar so that a check appears.
Click OK. The next time you’re working in the Quicken window, a button for
each folder and/or report should appear on the Quicken tool bar.
Note: If you don’t see the folder/report buttons immediately or see a single
button named More, there’s no room on the tool bar to display all the report
buttons, report folder buttons, and other buttons. So, you may want to cus-
tomize the tool bar a bit further, removing other buttons that you use less
often.

Viewing the report from the tool bar
A quick glance at the Quicken tool bar tells you whether you can access a
tool bar report with a single click or if you have to work extra hard and use
(gasp!) two clicks.
If you added a single report to the tool bar, its button looks like a sheet of
paper and includes the first several characters of the report’s name. The Big
Kahuna’s report in Figure 4-13 is a single report button. You can click the tool
bar button to open the report immediately.

if a folder
appears on

Exporting Report Data
654
If you added a folder of reports to the tool bar, the tool bar button has a folder
on it and also includes the first part of the folder name and a down-pointing
arrow. I’ve added the My Custom Banking report folder to my tool bar. As you
can see in Figure 4-13, when I click the folder button, Quicken displays a menu
with the reports in that folder. I can click the name of one of the reports and
the report pops open in its own window. 
Exporting Report Data
Virtually no one uses a single computer program as if living in a vacuum. Most
people need to move information between programs, to take advantage of a
feature not available in the program that currently holds the information, to
share information with others, or to keep records. Although Quicken’s reports
provide a good deal of flexibility, you might find instances when you want that
data in an alternate format for planning and other purposes.
That’s why you can export the data from any report or an image of any report
or graph that appears in the report window. Exporting converts the report
data or graph picture into another file format that certain other programs can
use. For example, if you want to play with some “what if” scenarios with
regard to the future performance of your investments, you could export the
Portfolio Value report to a format that your spreadsheet program can use. If
you want a record of how your finances looked on a particular date, you could
save an image file of a graph. Or, if you need to e-mail some financial informa-
tion to your tax preparer but don’t want to send the entire Quicken file, you
could create a PDF image of the report and e-mail that image instead.
When you click the Export Data menu at the top of a report or graph
window, Quicken presents the export format options available for that
report or graph:
✦Report to Excel Compatible Format
✦Copy report to Clipboard
✦Report/Graph to PDF format
Read on to find out how these three choices work.
Report to Excel compatible format
Available for reports only, this command enables you to export data as a tab-
delimited .TXT (plain text) file. Follow these steps to export the file:
1. After you choose the Report to Excel Compatible Format command,
the Create Excel Compatible File dialog box appears (Figure 4-14).

Book VII
Chapter 4
Printing and Saving
Reports
Exporting Report Data
655
This dialog box works just like any other file saving dialog box. Use the
Look In list and folder icons to select the folder in which you want to
save the file.
2. Type a name for the exported file in the File Name text box.
If you want to include the current date in the name for the exported file
so that you’ll know when you saved the data, be sure to enter the date
with hyphens (1-15-05 Net Worth), not slashes, as the slashes are not
permitted in filenames.
3. Make sure that Tab Delimited Export Files (*.TXT) appears in the Files
of Type field.
4. Click Open.
It seems strange that you click the Open command here: Nothing opens
when you click this command. To be more precise, the command should
probably read Save.
Be sure to remember the folder location where you saved the file so you
can find that file when you open your Excel program.
5. To work with the data in Excel, use that program’s File➪Open com-
mand or Open button.
6. Choose Text Files from the Files of Type drop-down list at the bottom
of the dialog box, and then navigate to the folder that holds the file
and click Open.
The Text Import Wizard dialog box appears.
7. Make sure that the Delimited option button is selected in the Text
Import Wizard dialog box, and then click Finish.
After you’ve opened the exported file, you may need to reformat some of
the cells and resize the columns, as shown in Figure 4-15.
Figure 4-14:
Exporting a
plain text
version of a
report.

Exporting Report Data
656
Tab-delimited means that a tab appears between each column of data in the
file. Plain text means that the file format uses very basic characters only,
with no fancy formatting.
Even though the name of the command includes “Excel compatible,” many
spreadsheet, word processing, and database programs can open plain text
files.
Copy Report to Clipboard
The Copy Report to Clipboard command appears for both reports and
graphs. If you use this command to copy a report, Quicken copies the report
data as tab-delimited plain text. If you use the command to copy a graph,
Quicken still copies only the report data, rather than as a picture of the
graph as you might expect.
To export using the Clipboard, follow these steps:
1. Click the Export Data button at the top of your report, and then
choose Copy Report to Clipboard.
2. Go to the destination application (typically a word processing program).
3. Create or open the document where you want to use the data.

4. Choose Edit➪Paste or click the Paste button on the tool bar, or press
Ctrl+V.
The report data appears in the document.
The Clipboard is a special holding area in your computer’s memory.
Information you copy goes to the Clipboard, from which you can paste
the information into another document or program. The Clipboard holds
only one copied image or set of report data at a time, so each time you
export a report to the Clipboard, the exported data replaces the previous
Clipboard contents.
Report/Graph to PDF format
This last export command uses a special printing driver to create a PDF file
with an image of the report data or graph. Follow these steps to create your
PDF file.
1. Click the Export Data button at the top of your report, and then
choose Report to PDF format.
Choosing this command opens the Print dialog box (Figure 4-16), which
in this case uses a special printing driver to write the PDF file as a file on
your hard disk.
2. You can just leave most of the settings in the Print dialog box as is,
with the exception of checking the Print in Color check box if you
want a color image, or changing the Orientation (Portrait versus
Landscape) choice.
3. Click OK, and Quicken opens the Save to PDF File dialog box.
4. Specify a save location and filename, and then click Save to create the
PDF file.
You can open the PDF file in any program that supports that format, like
the one shown in Figure 4-17.

PDF is short for the Portable Document Format developed by Adobe
Systems. You can download a free program (Acrobat Reader) for opening
PDF files from www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html.
PDF files are a nice way to send secure data because other users can’t
change the file unless they have special PDF software.
Printing Your Report
Sooner or later, you’ll need to get some of your Quicken reports off the screen
and onto paper. For example, you might have a meeting with an investment
advisor or tax planner, and want to provide that expert with some information
about your current financial picture. Printing Quicken reports and graphs
works much like printing in other applications, so if this information is a
yawner to you, skip it for now and only come back to it if you need to.
Customizing print features
To print a report or graph, you have to be working in the window for that
report or graph. Click the Print Report or Print Graph button on the window
tool bar to open Quicken’s Print dialog box.

As shown in Figure 4-18, the Print dialog box offers only a few basic settings.
✦Make sure that you have the right printer selected from the Printer drop-
down list (beside the option button of the same name).
✦Choose the Portrait (tall) or Landscape (wide) page orientation.
✦Specify which report pages to print and how many printout copies to
make using the Print Range and Number of Copies settings.
✦When active, click the Print in Color, Print in Draft Mode, and Fit to One
Page Wide options, as needed. (Those first two options may or may not
be active, depending on the printer you selected.)
If you just exported a PDF file of a report or graph, be sure that you choose
the correct printer from the Printer drop-down list. Your printer setting
might still point to PDF.
You also can click the Export To option button that appears in the Print
dialog box, and then choose a file format to export the report or graph data
to an ASCII, tab-delimited text, or .PRN (for Lotus 1-2-3) file.
Quicken lets you change a few layout settings via the Print dialog box. Click
the Printer Setup button at the bottom left of the Print dialog box to open the
Printer Setup for Reports and Graphs dialog box shown in Figure 4-19, and
then choose from these options:
✦You can enter larger or smaller margin sizes in the Left, Right, Top, and
Bottom text boxes. Just be aware that you can’t specify a margin that’s
smaller than your printer can handle. Most printers require minimum
margins of .25 inches all around, although some printers may require
even larger margins. Consult your printer documentation to learn its
minimum margin settings.

✦If you want to change the font (letter type) for the report headings or
body, click either the Heading Font or Body Font buttons in the Fonts
area, choose the alternate font in the dialog box that appears, and then
click OK.
When you’ve finished making your printer setup choices, click OK to return
to the Print dialog box.
The heading and body fonts you select become the defaults for all reports
and for future Quicken work sessions.
If you choose a font that you don’t like and want to return to the original,
remember that the font Quicken originally specified for both headings and
body text was the Arial font.
You can also access the Printer Setup for Reports and Graphs dialog box by
choosing File➪Printer Setup➪For Reports/Graphs.
After you’ve made your style selections, the printer you selected from the
Printer drop-down list controls any additional printing choices. Click the
Properties button beside the printer name to open the Properties dialog box
for your printer. The sample Properties dialog box in Figure 4-20 offers basic
settings on two tabs, plus an Advanced button to click for even more set-
tings like choosing a print quality. If you’re using a color inkjet printer, you
should see additional settings for ink density and so on. After you’ve
selected the property settings you prefer, click OK to apply them and return
to the Print dialog box.
Getting a preview
If you’ve changed a lot of print settings or have created a custom report that
you’ve never printed, it’s a good practice to preview the printout to identify
any problems that might exist or to see how many pages the report contains.
To preview the printout, click the Preview button in the Print dialog box.
Quicken displays the Print Preview. To get a close-up of what’s going on with
the report, click with the mouse anywhere on the report. (The mouse pointer
changes to a magnifying glass automatically in Print Preview.)

As you can see in the example in Figure 4-21, this particular report looks fine
with new heading and body fonts applied, but some of the columns appear
cut off at the right. To fix this problem, you would need to redesign the
report back in the report window. To cancel the report printout and return
to the report window, click the Close button at the top of the Print Preview.
You have to reopen the Print dialog box to make your changes.

Unlike in some other programs, closing the Print Preview in Quicken cancels
the whole print job.
While in the Print Preview window, you can use the Next Page and Prev Page
buttons to check each page in the printout, and the Zoom Out/Zoom In
button to get the overall picture of each page in the printout.
Print, baby, print!
If you skipped the Print Preview, click the OK button in the Print dialog box
(Figure 4-18) to send the report or graph to the printer.
If you took the road more traveled to the Print Preview, send the print job to
the printer from there by clicking the Print button at the top of the preview
window.
Give your report printout pages one last read to make sure there weren’t any
discrepancies between what you saw onscreen and how it printed. Then
you’re good to go!

 Exploring features of the Home & Business Program
 Advantages to using Home & Business
 Upgrading to Home & Business
You might think you need QuickBooks or a more sophisticated account-
ing program if you have a small business, but the truth is that Quicken
has everything most small businesses need. You can track your business
income and expenses, receivables and payables, produce payroll, and keep
track of your business assets with Quicken.
What You Get with Quicken Home & Business
Poke around in Quicken and you find all sorts of features guaranteed to
make your small business record-keeping task easier. Here’s a sample of
what you find in the latest version of Quicken Home & Business. (Note: 
This list describes the features from the 2006 version of Quicken Home &
Business. In addition, all of the features of the regular Quicken program are
also included in the Home & Business version.)
✦With the Business Center, a business overview including list of receiv-
ables and current payables.
✦A special report that shows how your business activity fits into your
Schedule C tax form.
✦Ability to store and attach copies of electronic receipts and tax forms
right in your Quicken program.
✦Tracking capability to monitor tax-deductible mileage.
✦The ability to track multiple jobs and prepare estimates.
✦Features to produce invoices, monthly statements, and related accounts
receivable reports.
✦Ability to track accounts payable and produce related reports.

✦Option for customizing business forms including the capability of plac-
ing your company logo on the forms.
✦Free access to live customer support.
✦60-day money-back guarantee.
Is Quicken Home & Business for you?
You might be wondering if you have the type of business that can take
advantage of the features offered by Quicken Home & Business. Here are
some points to consider when making the choice between Quicken and
other software programs:
✦Quicken is not a network-friendly program. Although different people
can take turns using the program, the program cannot be used by multi-
ple users simultaneously.
✦Quicken does not offer the specialized password-protection features of
the full-bodied accounting programs. You can password-protect your
entire Quicken data file, but not specific features of the file.
✦Quicken does not offer customized versions for particular industries
such as construction or manufacturing or retail.
✦Quicken does not offer point-of-sale features.
✦Quicken does not have the ability to track inventory.
✦Quicken does not offer the audit features that more sophisticated
accounting programs include.
✦Perhaps the most significant difference between Quicken and other
accounting programs is that Quicken is not a traditional double-
entry accounting program. In true accounting programs, one transaction
has a double effect, just as in real accounting. With Quicken, you can
make entries that only affect one account.
These all appear to be shortcomings of the Quicken program, and warnings
for the skeptical business-owner. But don’t forget all the great features of
Quicken, many of which you can’t find in a business accounting program:
✦Stellar investment tracking, including the ability to download current
investment values.
✦Personal finance features that let you operate both your personal finan-
cial life and your business from the same program.
✦Integration with TurboTax for seamless tax return preparation.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Quicken Premier

667
✦Economical online banking functions — many banks coordinate their
online services with Quicken for free or for a very small charge. With
QuickBooks, you might find you have to pay more and be more selective
when coordinating with online banking features.
So the bottom line is this: You have to decide what your business needs, and
then find the program that fits your business. Quicken offers a 60-day
money-back guarantee of the Home & Business program, so if you want to
experiment, you can do so without risk. Note also that an upgrade from
Quicken Premier to Quicken Home & Business is only $10.
Some business enterprises require an accounting program that has complete
double-entry accounting features and the more sophisticated accounts
receivable and accounts payable features that accrual-based businesses use.
But plenty of businesses don’t need the extra bells and whistles. See if your
business sounds like one of these — if it does, you should be just fine using
Quicken, and might not even need the Home & Business version:
✦Schedule C and Schedule E businesses. You know who you are. You
report your business activity on a Schedule C or Schedule E tax form
that accompanies your personal income tax return. The Schedule E is
for reporting rental activity. Other businesses go on the Schedule C.
✦Hobbies turned into businesses. If you’re already a Quicken user and
find that your hobby is generating income, or expect that your hobby
might turn into a viable business in the future, it’s time to start tracking
your business as an entity within Quicken.
✦If you own a business and comingle your business and personal bank
accounts, you’re going to love using Quicken to separate the two entities
and produce reports that show just how your business is faring.
✦Does your child operate a business? Odd jobs that start out small can
escalate into actual business ventures. Babysitting can become daycare,
tutoring can become classroom teaching, lawn mowing can become a
lawn service, and so on. When the odd job becomes a viable business,
it’s time to keep track of income and expenses.
✦If you’re planning a business venture in the future and right now are just
accumulating information, acquiring some assets, and incurring start-
up expenses, be sure to track all of those cash outlays in your Quicken
program.
✦Even small corporations that have a minimal number of employees can
use Quicken as their accounting program. As the business grows, a tran-
sition to a more complete accounting program such as QuickBooks is a
simple export command away.

Advantages to using Quicken for a small business
If you’ve read this entire book up to this point, you’re already familiar with
many of the advantages Quicken has to offer its users. But if you’re a small
business owner and you hopped right to this chapter, thinking this is all you
need to learn, you might be interested in this list of cool things that you can
do with Quicken. These features are particularly nice for business owners:
✦You can use your Quicken data to prepare your tax returns. By entering
tax line assignments that cross-reference your income and expenses to
the proper lines on your tax return, you can produce reports that enable
you to quickly determine what amounts to put on your tax return. And if
you use TurboTax tax preparation software, you can export your Quicken
information directly into your tax return. See Book V for more information
on how the tax features work.
✦Use Quicken to create all the reports you need to see how your business
is doing, analyze cash flow, compare actual activity to your budget, track
receivables and payables, and determine your net worth. Customize the
Creating a separate data file for your business
You can combine your business information with
your personal information in Quicken, and if you
are a sole proprietor who uses your personal
bank accounts to handle your business income
and expenses, the combination of the two
makes a certain amount of sense. On the other
hand, if it’s possible to separate your business
and your personal financial transactions, you
might want to consider keeping a completely
separate Quicken file for your business. You can
keep the file on the same computer as your per-
sonal file, but the two would not interact with
each other. Here are some advantages to keep-
ing your business transactions in a separate file.
 You can password-protect your Quicken
files. If you’re not the only person using
your Quicken program, you might want
password-protection on either your busi-
ness or your personal file or both.
 If you combine business and personal
financial activity in one file, you might find
that you use subcategories and classes to
separate your business transactions from
your personal transactions. You can avoid
this extra work and use top-level cate-
gories for your business activity if you keep
the business in a separate file.
 If you use an outside accountant or an off-
site bookkeeper to help with your business
finances, you might want to give that
person a separate data file that doesn’t
include your personal financial information.
 You can quickly produce business-only
reports, including tax reports, in your 
separate business file without having to 
customize reports to segregate personal
information from business information.
 With two separate files, you remove the
risk of mingling your personal and business
activities, classifying a business activity as
personal or vice versa.

report within the Quicken program and save your customized reports
for future use, or export your reports to your spreadsheet program for
more advanced customization.
✦It’s not enough to know if you have enough money in the bank to pay
this week’s bills. As a business owner, it’s imperative that you have a
sense of the value of your business. On any day, you must be able to pro-
duce a net worth report for your business. And if you want to determine
your overall net worth, net worth reports can include your personal
accounts too.
✦In addition to seeing your net worth report, potential lenders and investors
need to know whether your business is making money. Produce cash 
flow reports and profit and loss statements that show how your business
operates.
Structuring Your Categories for a Small Business
Whether you use a separate business file or combine your business and per-
sonal finances in one file, you need to set up the categories that are going to
be most useful to you in your business.
Typical business categories
Quicken Home & Business provides a category list replete with business-
related categories that you might encounter. You can use the list as is, but
hardly anyone is going to want every category chosen by Quicken and only
those categories. It’s more likely that you’ll take Quicken up on its offer to let
you hide categories you don’t need, or even delete categories you’re certain
you’ll never need, and then add your own categories.
If you already have a chart of accounts for your business, you can use that
as a guide for creating your Quicken categories. If you’re new to the whole
business of choosing and creating categories, here are some guidelines that
can help point you in the right direction.
A chart of accounts is divided into five groups of accounts, and you should
follow this same grouping when deciding what categories you need to set up
in Quicken for your business. Consider each account group, determine what
is appropriate for your business from each type of account, and create your
main categories from these selections.
After you’ve set up your main categories, you can add additional top-level cat-
egories at any time. Also, you can add subcategories and sub-subcategories,
as many levels as you need, to create the kind of organization scheme that
works best for you.

✦Assets: Assets are the things you own. This group includes the following
types of categories:
• Bank accounts
• Investment accounts
• Accounts receivable
• Inventory
• Fixed assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, equipment, vehicles,
and computers
• Deposits that you make on utilities or other services
✦Liabilities: Liabilities are the amounts you owe. Typical Quicken liability
categories include
• Accounts payable
• Credit cards
• Deposits that you receive from customers
• Taxes that you’ve collected from customers and employees and owe
to the government
• Loans
✦Equity: Equity is another word for net worth. In Quicken, your equity is
computed on your net worth statement. However, you might have some
equity categories that include the following:
• Owner’s draw
• Contributed capital
• Capital stock
• Dividends
✦Income: The categories for the income you earn depend heavily on the
type of business you run and the sources for your income. Here are
some sample categories that you might see in this group. Remember
that these categories are in addition to any personal income you record
in your Quicken file:
• Sales
• Personal service income
• Interest income
• Dividend income
✦Expenses: The way in which you spend your money in order to run your
business results in a plethora of categories that you can use to track your
spending. Remember that the more detailed you get with your categories,

the easier it is to budget and monitor your spending. If your expense cat-
egory list gets too long, consider grouping subcategories under main
category headings. Here are some sample categories you might have in
your business:
• Rent
• Salaries and wages
• Advertising
• Insurance, including auto, liability, health, life, workmen’s comp, 
disability, property
• Office supplies
• Travel
• Taxes, including payroll, property, sales, income
• Utilities
• Leased equipment
• Repairs
• Computer supplies
• Trash removal
• Manufacturing costs
• Packaging
• Shipping
• Automobile expense
• Bank fees
• Legal and other professional services
• Dues, licenses, subscriptions
• Interest expense
• Meals and entertainment
• Telephone, cell phone
• Internet service
• Copying, faxing
Creative use of subcategories
Subcategories in Quicken give you the ability to record your financial transac-
tions with detailed precision, and at the same time produce reports that are
not cluttered with tons of categories. Here’s an example. You want to get a
handle on your shipping costs by creating a category called Shipping. For

Structuring Your Categories for a Small Business
672
more detail, you break that category into two subcategories called Packaging
and Mailing. By assigning your shipping costs to the proper category, you can
see how much you spend on the packaging part of your shipments as opposed
to the amount spent on the actual mailing costs.
Want more detail? Create sub-subcategories under Packaging for Boxes, Tape,
Wrapping Paper, Labels, Bubble Wrap, Packing Filler. Create sub-subcategories
under Mailing for Priority Mail, Ground Transport, Air Transport, Overnight
Mail, or whatever specific services your company uses.
After you get the subcategories and the sub-subcategories set up (and you
don’t have to stop there — Quicken actually lets you create 16 levels of sub-
categories (sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- and so on). So feel free to go nuts with your
categories if that will give you the information you need to more effectively
run your business.
Using multiple levels of subcategories
Although Quicken provides the capability of
layering up to 16 levels of subcategories, you
probably don’t need to go that in-depth with
your category assignments. On the other hand,
here are some examples of how you might use
multiple levels of subcategories effectively.
 Previously in this chapter I discussed set-
ting up subcategories for shipping. You
might want to track detailed shipping costs
for each type of item that you ship. In this
case, your parent category could be
Shipping, and then you would break out the
various types of items you ship in the next
level of subcategory. Under each item type,
you would have the sub-subcategory
breakdown for Packaging and Mail, and
then you would go to a fourth level of sub-
sub-subcategories for the detail of types of
package and mail services that you use.
 Another example of how to use the various
levels of subcategories is to consider 
tracking your vehicle expenses. Say you
have two cars and you use each car for both
business and personal travel. You need to
report the cost of operating each car on
your tax return, and then allocate expenses
between business and personal based on
the percent that your business mileage is 
of the total. Your overall expense category
might be called Automobile. The first sub-
category can separate each vehicle, so
you’d have a subcategory for Car 1 and
another subcategory for Car 2. On the 
sub-subcategory level, you can break out
detailed expenses for each car’s fuel costs,
repairs, insurance, registration, oil changes
and other maintenance, and so on.
Don’t be afraid to get creative with your sub-
categories. The goal is to get the best informa-
tion you can out of your Quicken program, and
if multiple layers of subcategories achieve that
goal, go for it!

Setting up subcategories
The trick to successfully setting up subcategories is to start with the top-
level category. If you haven’t got the parent, you can’t create the kids.
Actually, that’s not quite true: You can create a parent category and then
later turn that parent into a kid. (We’ve all been there, right?!) Let me just
show you how it’s done:
1. Open the Category list.
Choose Tools➪Category List, or press Ctrl+C (or Shift+Ctrl+C).
Ctrl+C is the standard Quicken command for opening the category list.
Sometimes, this command morphs into Shift+Ctrl+C. I’ve placed the
second option as an alternative throughout the book. You can tell which
command your program responds to by either trying both commands to
see which command works, or by looking at the keyboard shortcut that
is listed on your Tools menu across from Category List.
2. Open the Set Up Category window.
Click the New button at the bottom of the Category List to open the
setup window.
3. Enter the name and a description for your new category.
Enter your information in the Set Up Category window, as shown in
Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1:
Setting up
a new
category

Structuring Your Categories for a Small Business
674
Make sure your category name is unique and that you haven’t 
already created another category for the same type of transactions.
Occasionally I create a new category, forgetting that I already have
another category doing the same job, like Phone and Telephone, or
Postage and Mailing.
4. Select a group name if you’re using category groups, or you can leave
the group blank.
Category groups are used for budgeting purposes; for example, in situa-
tions where you want to budget an amount for a group of expenses with-
out having to provide a detailed expense breakdown in the budget. You
could set up a group for entertainment expenses that would include
movies, theatre, sporting events, amusement parks, and so on, and
budget just one amount for all entertainment.
5. Choose whether this category is for income or expenses.
In Quicken, all categories are either income or expense. It’s income if
money is coming into your accounts from this category. It’s an expense if
money is going out.
6. Indicate subcategory information.
If this is a top-level category, do not mark the subcategory option. If
you’ve already set up the top-level category and this is to be a subcate-
gory, click the subcategory of option and choose the higher category
from the drop-down list.
7. Enter optional tax information.
If you choose to produce tax-related reports through Quicken, check the
Tax-Related check box and select the appropriate tax line from the Tax
Line Item drop-down list. You must select a tax line if you want the amount
to appear in your Tax Summary Report.
For more information about tax lines, tax reports, and creating tax
returns from the information in your Quicken file, see Book V.
8. Click OK to save your new category.
You can come back at any time and make changes in the category infor-
mation. Open the category list, click on the category you want to change,
and then click the Edit button at the bottom of the list. An Edit Category
window appears where you can make changes.
You don’t have to open each category individually for editing in order to
assign tax lines. You can assign tax lines to your categories efficiently by
using the Tax Line Item Assignments window in the Category List.
Subcategories in Quicken reports
Most Quicken reports display both top-level categories and subcategories.
The top-level category name appears, and then the subcategories associated

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Quicken Premier
Home & Business
Structuring Your Categories for a Small Business
675
with that category appear indented, beneath the top-level category, like chil-
dren assembled beneath the parent. You can drill down to see the detail of
any subcategory amount by double-clicking on the amount.
Top-level category amounts cannot be drilled if subcategories are present.
If you want to hide the display of the subcategories and only show the top-
level category amounts on your report, follow these quick steps:
1. Open the Customize window.
With the report displayed, click the Customize button that appears in
the top-right corner, or press Alt+U. A Customize window appears.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
Several tabs appear in the Customize window. The Advanced tab is the
right-most tab (see Figure 1-2).
3. Hide subcategories by clicking the Subcategories drop-down list and
choosing Hide All.
4. Click OK.
Your report reappears, this time with only the top-level categories.
Although it appears that you can drill down on the amounts that appear
on your report, drilling on top-level categories provides you with an
empty report, even when no subcategories are present on the report.
The actual transactions still reside in the subcategories, thus there is no
detail associated with the top-level category.
Figure 1-2:
Click the
Advanced
tab to hide
subcate-
gories.

676
Changing the level of a subcategory
There might come a time when you want to reorganize your categories.
Perhaps you want to make Telephone a subcategory under Utilities instead
of the top-level category status you originally assigned. Or maybe you want
to pull Internet Service out from under the category heading of Computer
and let it have a top-level category all its own.
You can change the hierarchy of a category easily by editing the category.
Just follow these steps:
1. Open the Category List.
Choose Tools➪Category List from the menu, or press Ctrl+L.
2. Edit a category.
Click on the category whose hierarchy you want to change, and then
click the Edit button. The Edit Category window appears.
3. Change the subcategory status.
If you’re moving a category from a lowly subcategory level to a top-level,
you need to choose Income or Expense as the category type. As you can
see, you can’t uncheck the subcategory option. But choosing Income or
Expense has the effect of unchecking the subcategory. If you want to
make this category a subcategory of another category or even another
subcategory, click the subcategory option, and then find the appropriate
parent category from the drop-down list (see Figure 1-3).
4. Click OK.
Clicking OK implements the category level change.
Figure 1-3:
Click the
drop-down
list to pick

677
Changing the level of a category has an immediate ripple effect through-
out your Quicken program. Don’t worry — no transactions are harmed
when you change the category to a different level. But all transactions
associated with that category are revised and are now part of the new
level.
Some of your reports might change when you change the level of a cate-
gory. If you are relying on printed reports that include the category you
are changing, you might want to reprint those reports.
Using classes
The Quicken Class feature provides another way for you to organize your
transactions and pinpoint transactions of a certain type. With classes, you
assign a transaction to a category, and then tag the transaction with a class.
For example, in the previous section, we talked about creating subcategories
under your top-level shipping category for packaging supplies and mailing
costs. What if you want to track the shipping costs for different types of items
that you ship? Say you ship personal items as well as items that relate to your
business. You don’t want to have to set up two sets of the same categories
and subcategories. Instead, you can set up a class for personal and another
class for business, and then with each shipping expense you record, you put
it in the proper subcategory and assign a class, either personal or business.
Here’s another good use of classes. Perhaps you own rental property and
you have the same types of income and expenses for each property. Instead
of creating separate categories and subcategories for each piece of rental
property, which can result in a lot of duplicated effort, just set up a class for
each piece of rental property, and tag your transaction to the proper class.
You can split transactions among different classes. So if you pay for repairs
on two different rental units, you can enter one transaction when you pay for
the repairs, and then enter the transaction as a split transaction and assign
the proper expense to each rental unit.
Setting up some classes
Creating classes in Quicken is easy. First, decide what kinds of classes you
want. The decision is all yours — there are no restrictions on the type of
classes you create — it’s simply a matter of how you want to track your
Quicken transactions and what will be most useful for you. The classes
you create stay with Quicken and you can use them, or not, on any of your
transactions.
If you upgrade to a new version of Quicken at some point in the future, your
class descriptions move forward into the upgraded version.

Structuring Your Categories for a Small Business
678
When you’re ready to set up your classes in Quicken, you can follow these
steps, or you can wait until you are ready to record transactions and set up
new classes on-the-fly, as you need them.
1. Open the Class List.
Choose Tools➪Class List from the menu, or press Ctrl+L. The Class List
appears. There are no default classes that come with your Quicken pro-
gram, so the first time you open the Class List, the list is empty, as
shown in Figure 1-4.
2. Open the Set Up Class window.
Click New in the Class List window and the Set Up Class window
appears.
3. Enter the name for your class.
The name is required; the description is optional. Enter a name for your
class (see Figure 1-5). You are limited to 40 characters, including spaces.
Enter a description if you like.

4. Enter a copy number, if you dare.
The copy number basically lets you use the same class name for differ-
ent types of transactions. Going with the rental property example I gave
earlier, rather than naming your classes with the address of each rental
property, you could just use Rental Property as the class name, and then
assign a separate copy number to each property. I’m not sure how you’d
remember which number goes with which property, but I guess that’s a
problem for a different day. Personally, I prefer to skip the copy numbers
and give more meaningful and separate class names to each class.
5. Click OK.
Your Set Up Class window closes and the new class is added to your
Class List.
6. Repeat steps 1-5. Over and out.
Keep going — you’re on a roll! Continue setting up all the classes you think
you will want to use. Just close the Class List window by clicking the X in the
corner when you’ve finished entering your classes.
There’s no reminder system in Quicken to tell you that you need to assign a
class to a transaction. It’s up to you to remember about the classes and
include the class when entering your transaction.
You can edit the name of a class if you made a misspelling or decide to
change a class name. Just open the Class List, click on a class, and then click
the Edit button, make your changes and click OK. If you decide you don’t
want to use a class, click the class name and click Delete. But beware — see
the following Warning.
If you delete a class that has been used in some transactions, that class name
is removed from the transactions you assigned to it. Those transactions are
no longer part of any class.
Assigning classes to transactions
Now that you’ve got these classes, what are you going to do with them?
Going forward, you can assign transactions to classes as you enter the trans-
actions. If you want to get some historical information into your classes, you
can go back to existing transactions and assign classes too. To assign a class
to a transaction, follow these steps:
1. Start entering the transaction or click on a transaction that needs a
class assignment.
2. Open the Class List.
Either choose Tools➪Class List from the menu, or press Ctrl+L. Either
way, the Class List appears (or not — see the upcoming Warning).

Structuring Your Categories for a Small Business
680
3. Choose your class.
There are three ways to pick a class — you can click on the class, you
can arrow down to the class, or you can start typing the name of the
class. One way or another, you get that class selected. In Figure 1-6, I’ve
chosen my rental townhouse as the class for this particular transaction.
4. Accept the class.
Either double-click on the class or press Enter when the class has been
selected. Either action has the effect of closing the class window and
assigning the class to the current register transaction.
You don’t have to have your cursor in the Category field when entering a
class. As long as you’ve clicked somewhere on the transaction, you can
open the Class List and select a class at any time.
You don’t lose your chance to assign a class if you forget to do so when
entering a transaction. You can go back to previously entered transac-
tions and assign classes at any time.
The Class List cannot be opened from the Write Checks window in
Quicken. You can manually enter a class by placing a slash (/) after the
category name and entering a class, or you can wait until you record 
the check and it appears in your register, and then assign the class in the
register transaction as described above.

OK, class, time for some reports
After you set up classes, you can see the results of your labors by producing
reports that include class groupings, or by producing reports that only
reflect the transactions in a particular class.
If the Quicken report you are working with provides the opportunity to dis-
play additional columns, you can select Class as your column option, and
your report opens up to display a column for each class (see Figure 1-7).
You can easily access class reports that show you the transactions that have
been tagged with a particular class. Here’s how:
1. Open the Class List.
Choose Tools➪Class List from the menu or press Ctrl+L.
2. Choose a class.
Click on the class that you want to see represented in the report.
3. Open the Class Report.
Click the Report button at the top of the Class List window (see
Figure 1-8). The Class List slides down to the bottom of your Quicken
window, appearing as a button, and the Class Report appears, displaying
all transactions that have been assigned to the class you chose.

W
hen you work at a job, you earn money that is paid to you on a regular
basis: weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or perhaps monthly. In most
cases, you do the work, and then you receive your pay. In other words, at any
given time, your employer probably owes you money for some work you have
done. You have an account receivable. And when you charge a purchase on
your credit card, you’ve made the purchase, but you haven’t yet paid for it.
Until you actually pay your credit card bill, you have an account payable.
Welcome to the World of Accrual Basis Bookkeeping
If you prepare financial reports that show your Accounts Receivable and
your Accounts Payable, you are said to have prepared accrual basis reports.
If instead, you only report on income that you have actually received and
you only report on expenses that you have actually paid for, you are said to
have prepared cash basis reports. Businesses are required to pick whether
they want to report their income and expenses on an accrual basis or a cash
basis, and then they are expected to stick with that choice.
But the truth is, most individuals and their small businesses use a hybrid of
cash and accrual when making reports and preparing tax returns. Here are
some examples of income and expenses that get mixed up in the cash
versus accrual presentation:
✦It’s December 31, 2006. Your paycheck that covers the period from
December 16 through December 31 won’t be issued until January 15,
2007. When you assemble your tax information for 2006, chances are

Welcome to the World of Accrual Basis Bookkeeping
684
good that you’re not going to include that January 15, 2007 paycheck in
with your taxable income for 2006. So your tax return is prepared on a
cash basis, right?
✦You broke your leg in December, 2006 and decided to purchase crutches
and a ramp for your front door steps. You have enough medical expenses
in 2006 to take advantage of the itemized deductions and you want to
include as many expenses as you can as 2006 deductions. You are
allowed to include the December purchases of crutches and a ramp as
part of your 2006 tax deductions, even though you won’t actually pay
the credit card bill until 2007. So, your tax return is now partially pre-
pared on an accrual basis.
✦It’s July and you’re preparing financial statements for your banker
because you want to borrow some money to remodel your home. You owe
$10,000 in credit card debt. You anticipate earning a bonus of $5,000 from
your job in December. You can bet your banker wants to see that $10,000
in debt on your financial statements. Accrual basis. But the December
bonus — well, a lot can happen between now and December, including
you might not have your job or your employer might change his mind
about that bonus. So no bonus goes on the financials. Cash basis.
As you can see, the presentation might get muddled. But you know what you
owe and you know what is owed to you. No matter how you ultimately pres-
ent this information on tax returns and financial statements, you can keep
track of all of your receivables and payables in Quicken.
Quicken Home & Business offers separate receivables and payables features,
but you can keep track of these amounts just fine even in regular versions of
Quicken, simply by setting up the accounts you need and making the proper
entries.
If you enter receivables and payables in Quicken Home & Business and then
receive or pay the amounts, the receivables and payables accounts are auto-
matically cleared. This process is described later in this chapter. In other
versions of Quicken, clearing the receivable is a two-step process. You need
to clear the receivables and payables accounts manually as well as enter the
receipts and the payments in your bank account register.
If you’ve entered a receivable in an Accounts Receivables account, here’s a
quick method for entering the deposit in your bank account register. First,
open the receivables account register. Find the receivable for which you have
received payment and click on it. Cut the transaction, and then open the bank
account register and Paste the transaction, saving yourself having to actually
enter the transaction twice. The same process works for payables.

Using Quicken’s Accounts Receivable
and Invoicing Features
Because we can probably all agree that entering your paychecks when you
earn them instead of when you receive them is impractical, here’s an exam-
ple of accounts receivable that actually occurs in real life.
Say that you own a little catering business. You meet with your customers,
determine their needs, receive an order, arrange a date for delivery, pur-
chase the ingredients and supplies that you need, prepare the food, deliver
the food, send an invoice, and, ta-da! get paid!
One of the issues you’re going to discuss with your customer is, “When does
a receivable exist?” Is the customer committed to pay you when the order is
made? When you’ve purchased the food? What if you purchase the food and
the customer changes his mind and cancels the order? Who is responsible for
paying for the food? Perhaps you arrange to take a deposit when the delivery
date is determined. Or maybe you make the customer commit in writing to
pay your costs if the order is cancelled after a certain date. These are issues
to consider when establishing your business and dealing with customers.
These are also issues to consider when entering your income in Quicken.
Say you agree to fill an order that costs the customer $500. When you sign 
an agreement with the customer, you receive a down payment of $250. If you
fail to fulfill your end of the bargain, you are responsible for returning the
deposit. If the customer cancels the order, the deposit is yours to keep. The
balance of the remaining $250 is to be invoiced when the food is delivered,
and the payment is due 30 days thereafter.
In Quicken, you need to record the $250 when you receive it, and then the
receivable of the additional $250 when you invoice that amount. Finally, you
record the final payment when you receive it.
✦I recommend that you set up a separate account called Escrow or
Customer Deposit or a similar name. When you receive deposits, like the
initial $250 that your customer paid you, those amounts get entered into
the Escrow account register, to remain there until you actually earn the
money. In that way, you can keep track of amounts that technically
aren’t yours yet.
✦If you’re tracking the individual job, you need to keep track of the costs
as you purchase food and other items specifically for that job. You can
use the Class feature to assign the purchases to a class that represents
that job, or you can track the actual job if you use Quicken Home &
Business. Each time you make a purchase for that job, tag the amount so
it is associated with the job.

Setting Up Accounts Receivable
686
✦When the job is complete, you can transfer the escrow money into your
regular bank account, clearing the amount from your escrow account.
✦Issue an invoice for the remaining $250. At this time, you record the
account receivable.
✦When you get your money, the receivable account is relieved of the $250
and the money is deposited in your bank account.
Setting Up Accounts Receivable
Setting up Accounts Receivable is much like setting up a bank account in
Quicken; however, the account isn’t actually a cash account and there is no
bank associated with the account. Instead, the account is used to keep a
record of the amount owed to you. Follow these steps to create your
Accounts Receivable account:
1. Open the Account List.
Choose Tools➪Account List from the menu or Press Ctrl+A. The Account
List appears, showing all your existing accounts and their current bal-
ances, as well as some general information such as which accounts are
activated for online services.
2. Open the Quicken Account Setup window.
Click the Add Account option to open the Setup window. You are asked
to enter basic information about your account.
3. Check the option to indicate that this account is not held at a financial
institution, and then click Next.
Remember, this is not an actual cash account. The Accounts Receivable
account is merely a place to keep a record of how much money is owed
to you.
4. Choose the account type.
Unless you’re using the Home & Business version of Quicken, you
won’t see a choice for Accounts Receivable. However, you do want the
Accounts Receivable to appear with your other assets on your financial
statements, so choose Asset as the account type (see Figure 2-1), and
then click Next.
5. Name the account Accounts Receivable.
You can call the account whatever name seems appropriate to you, but
Accounts Receivable, A/R, or Receivables are the most appropriate.

Chapter 2

6. Skip the next questions.
There is no bank statement for this account, so you don’t need to
change the statement date. The date automatically defaults to today’s
date, and that’s fine. Leave the ending balance at zero (see Figure 2-2).
Even if you have some existing receivables that you want to list in this
account, you need to list them individually or else how will you know
what they are? Therefore, you’ll enter those receivables later. For now,
just stick with a zero balance.
7. Click Done.
The new Accounts Receivable account is ready to be used. The register
for the account opens when you click the Done button. The account
itself can be found over on the Account Bar, under Property & Debt.

Business Center — it doesn’t matter which one you click.
3. Select the account type.
Choose Invoices/Receivables as the account type, as shown in Figure 2-3,
and then click the Next button.
4. Enter a name for the account.
You can either create one master Invoices/Receivables account for your
entire company, or you can choose to set up a separate account for each
customer. If you create one account for all receivables, you want to give
the account a generic name that encompasses all of your receivables.
Customer Invoices is the default name chosen by Quicken. If you choose
to create separate receivables accounts for each customer, include the
customer name in the account name. This latter method is more effec-
tive if you have a small number of customers with whom you do a lot of
business.

You can’t name the Invoices/Receivables account Accounts Receivable
because that name is already used by Quicken. However, the name you
choose is going to appear on your financial statements, so be sure to
pick a professional-sounding name, such as Outstanding Invoices or
simply, Receivables.
When you finish setting up the Invoices/Receivables account, the regis-
ter for that account appears. See “Setting up invoices” below for infor-
mation on how to enter transactions into this register.
Accounts Receivable and Your Reports
When you create invoices, the invoices are recorded in your receivables
account and become a part of your recorded earnings at the time they are
recorded.
When you have an Accounts Receivable account, the information in that
account is available to be included in your reports. For example, when you
produce a report of your earnings, you can include your receivables in those
earnings to see how much money you’ve really made, even though you
haven’t yet received all of the money. On your net worth statement, the
receivables appear as an asset, increasing your net worth.
If you need to prepare a cash basis report, make sure your receivables are
not included in the report totals.
In Quicken Home & Business, the invoices/receivables account that you create
appears on your Net Worth statement in a section called Other Assets.
Setting up invoices
You must have the Quicken Home & Business program to actually take advan-
tage of Quicken’s invoices feature, but that doesn’t mean you can’t create
invoices and enter them in Quicken. Whether you use Home & Business or
not, you still need to invoice your customers and keep track of those invoices.
In Home & Business, here is the process for creating an invoice.
1. Open the Invoice form.
In the Business Center, on the My Data tab, click the Create an Invoice
button. A separate window that looks like an actual invoice form
appears. You can also choose Business➪Invoices and Estimates➪Create
Invoice from the menu. Or, if the Invoices register is visible, click the
Create New button at the top, and then choose Invoice.

Accounts Receivable and Your Reports
690
If the standard invoice form that comes with your Quicken program does
not provide the fields you need, or if it contains fields that you don’t need,
you can create your own style of invoice. See Chapter 5 of Book VIII for an
example of how you can customize your invoice form so that it provides
exactly the columns and fields that you need for your business.
2. Enter customer name.
At the top of your invoice, you need to enter the name of the customer
in the Customer field (see Figure 2-4). After you enter the name, Quicken
saves that name and makes it available on a drop-down list for future use.
You can enter your customers by last name first, or first name first. I typ-
ically enter the customer’s last name first, and then the first name. It’s
easier to search by last name through an alphabetical list. On the other
hand, if you only have a few customers, your list will be quite short, so
searching might not be a problem.
3. Enter the type of project or job.
At the top of the invoice form, you need to enter the job or project type.
This is a name of your choosing. When you enter a name for the first
time, a window appears asking if you want to create a new project/job
with the name you entered. You have to choose Yes or you can’t enter
the project name. When you click Yes, the New Project/Job window
appears (Figure 2-5), where you can enter as much or as little informa-
tion about the project as you like. The minimum information you can
enter is the project name, which is what I’ve done in Figure 2-5. Click OK
to return to the Invoice form.
Figure 2-4:
Fill out the
invoice form
just as you
would fill
out a paper
invoice.

Book VIII
Chapter 2

Accounts Payable
Accounts Receivable and Your Reports
691
Project/job names are associated with each customer. For each customer,
you need to set up a new project/job name, even if it is the same project/
job name you use with other customers.
4. Enter your customer’s address.
If you plan to mail this invoice, enter a mailing address on the invoice in
the Bill To section. The address is optional, especially if you intend to
e-mail the invoice. If the Ship To address is appropriate for this customer,
enter information in that field as well.
You only need to enter a customer’s mailing address once. Quicken
remembers the address and displays it the next time you create an
invoice for this customer.
5. Enter the invoice date.
Quicken automatically places today’s date in the Date field. You can
accept that date or change to whatever date you need. Quicken automat-
ically enters a Due Date 30 days after whatever date you enter in the
Date field.
6. Enter an invoice number.
After you’ve created one invoice in Quicken and assigned a number to
that invoice, Quicken automatically increments the invoices and enters
the next available number in the Invoice # field. You can accept this
number or overwrite it with another number if necessary.
7. Confirm the due date.
The Due Date field gets filled in automatically. You can change the due
date to whatever date you want.
8. Enter a P.O. number.
If your customer provides you with a Purchase Order number, enter that
number in the field provided. This is a number your customer generates,
not a number you create yourself. If your customer hasn’t given you a
Figure 2-5:
Enter
information
about the
project or
job for
which you
are creating
an invoice.

Accounts Receivable and Your Reports
692
P.O. number, you can leave this field blank, or perhaps enter the name of
the contact who you spoke with, or some other pertinent information
regarding how the order was placed.
9. Enter the invoice descriptions and amounts.
In the lower portion of the invoice form, you need to enter the details of
what you are invoicing for. The first time you enter a new item, you are
going to be asked to set up that item in Quicken. After you’ve set up an
item, the item is available to you for use on future invoices.
10. Set up a new item.
An item is something you sell. This can be a service, like catering (in the
example shown in Figure 2-6) or legal services, or a tangible item like
handmade pottery or quilts, or even an intangible item like computer
software. Enter a name for the item, and then enter the category where
income from sales of this item should be recorded (see next step). Enter
an optional description. If you charge the same fee over and over again
for this item, you can enter the fee in the Per Item Rate field. If the fee is
not fixed, leave this field blank. Click OK to save the item.
11. Set up a new category.
When you set up your new item, you had to indicate the category where
income from this item should be recorded. If this if the first time for
recording income from this item, you might need to set up a new category.
When you enter a category name that has not been set up previously, the
Set Up Category window automatically appears (Figure 2-7). Give the cate-
gory a name, keeping in mind that this name is going to appear on your
financial statements. Confirm that the Income option is selected. You can
assign the category to a tax line at this time if you like (see Book V for
more on tax lines), or you can take care of that at a later time.
Figure 2-6:
Enter
information
about the
item you sell
on your
invoices.

12. Enter or revise the description.
Back to the invoice after all those side trips to set up categories and
items. After you start using invoices regularly, most of the information
you need is already set up and available to you on drop-down lists. Now
it’s time to enter an optional description in the Description field of the
invoice. If you entered a description when you set up the new item, that
descriptive information already appears on the invoice. You can accept
that description or override it if there is something more appropriate
you want to enter on the invoice for this customer. For example, I offer
tax services to my clients. When I prepare a tax return for a client, I
enter Tax Return Preparation as my service. Because I prepare different
types of tax returns and the returns are for different years, no one
description fits all of the tax return preparation services I perform, so
I left the description area blank when I set up my item, and I enter the
appropriate description in the description field on the invoice.
13. Enter the quantity and rate or amount.
Quantity and Rate are optional fields on your invoice, but useful fields as
well. If you sell multiple quantities of an item, you can enter the quantity
on the invoice, and then enter the per-item rate. Quicken takes care of
the multiplication for you and enters a total in the Amount column.
Alternatively, if you are offering services, the Quantity and Rate fields
might not be useful to you. In that case, you can leave those fields blank
(or remove them altogether — see Chapter 5 for more of a discussion on
customizing your invoice forms), and just enter the total amount in the
Amount column.
Figure 2-7:
Enter
pertinent
information
about your
new income
category.

Accounts Receivable and Your Reports
694
14. Verify sales tax.
If you have to charge sales tax, you need to enter the rate in the Tax box
at the bottom of the invoice. Enter the percent in the box provided. If tax
doesn’t automatically compute, click to the right of the amount in the T
column to place a T for Taxable next to the invoice amount. Quicken
takes care of calculating the tax for you.
When you click to place a T on the invoice, Quicken tags that item as
being taxable for future invoices. Also, when you enter a sales tax per-
centage on an invoice, Quicken remembers that percentage for future
taxable sales.
When you set up a new item (see step 10 above), you can check the
Taxable box in the New Item window to make an item taxable every time
you sell it.
15. Enter an optional customer message.
The Customer Message box is for a brief message that prints on the
bottom of the customer’s invoice. Quicken comes already loaded with 
a few Chatty-Cathy-type phrases, such as “All work is complete!” and
“We accept credit cards.” You can enter your own glib (or otherwise)
phrases, and they are saved, along with Quicken’s phrases, on the drop-
down list, ready for future use.
16. Enter an optional memo.
At the very bottom of the invoice form is the Memo field. The informa-
tion you enter here does not print on the invoice, so you can be as casual
and as direct as you want. This information is for your eyes only.
17. Send your invoice!
You’ve come this far — don’t stop yet! You can click the Print button to
print a paper copy of the invoice, or you can click the E-mail/Clipboard
button to send your invoice by e-mail. Click Print and the Print Invoice
window appears. Click OK to print your invoice. Click E-mail/Clipboard
and the Send Invoice by E-mail window appears (Figure 2-8). Verify the
e-mail information, enter the customer’s e-mail address if necessary, and
then click OK. You are asked to provide some information about your own
e-mail address and server if this is the first time you’ve emailed anything
from Quicken. After all the information is entered, an e-mail message
appears (Figure 2-9). You can enter any personal comments that you
want to include, and then click the Send button to e-mail the invoice.
18. Done at last!
Save the invoice by clicking Save and Done or Save and New. The first
option closes the invoice window; the second opens a new invoice
window. In both cases, the invoice is saved and entered in your Invoices
register.

By using the Invoices account, you can see at a glance which invoices
haven’t been paid and send notices to the customers with outstanding
invoices.
Receiving a payment
When you receive a payment, you need to deposit the money and record the
deposit in Quicken. You know all about how to record deposits, but what
about the deposit of an amount you have recorded as a receivable? Not only
do you need to deposit the money, but you need to clear the receivable so
you no longer show the customer as owing money to you. If you’re recording
your invoices as accounts receivable in Quicken Home & Business, here’s
how to record the payment of an invoice.
You can record the payment of an invoice in Quicken Home & Business in
one of three ways. I describe each method here, and you can pick the one
you like best or the one that seems most appropriate at the time you receive
a payment.

message if

Accounts Receivable and Your Reports
696
Method 1: Using the Invoices register
Here’s how to record a payment using the Invoices register:
1. Display the Invoices register.
2. Click on the transaction for which you have received payment.
You can scroll through the register to find the right transaction, or you
can use the Find feature to find a particular transaction in the register.
But the truth is, if there are so many transactions in the register that you
can’t quickly find the one that matches the payment you received, try
one of the other two methods presented here. They work more quickly
when you have many outstanding receivables.
3. Click the Form button.
On the right side of the transaction are Enter, Edit, and Form buttons
(Figure 2-10). Click the Form button and the original invoice appears.
If the Form button doesn’t appear, you’ve turned off the Transaction
toolbar in Quicken’s Preferences window. No matter. When you click 
on a transaction in the receivables register, a little green checkmark
appears in the Category field. Clicking this checkmark has the same
effect as clicking the Form button.
4. Open the Customer Payment window.
On the original invoice that appears, click the Receive Pmt button. The
invoice disappears from your screen and the Customer Payment window
appears (Figure 2-11).
5. Verify the payment amount and date.
The customer payment window opens, showing today’s date and the full
amount of the invoice in the Payment column. If this information is cor-
rect, there are no changes to make. If the customer made a partial pay-
ment instead of the full amount, change the payment amount. If the
payment was received on a date other than today, enter the actual pay-
ment date. If you like, you can enter a check number in the field provided.
If more than one invoice is outstanding for this customer, all of the out-
standing invoices are listed at the bottom of the Customer Payment
window. The payment has been applied to the invoice you had open in
step 3 above. See the section, “Method 3: Using the Record a Payment
button” later in this chapter for more information on how to change the
invoice to which the payment is applied.
6. Verify the bank account information.
The account listed in the Deposit To field is the account to which this
deposit will be recorded. Make sure this is the account where you actu-
ally plan to deposit the money!

7. Complete the transaction.
Click OK. The Customer Payment window closes. The receivable is
marked as Cleared in your Invoices register.
The payment you received has been recorded as a deposit in your bank
account. However, you still need to take or send the money to the bank for
an actual deposit in your account.

Method 2: Using the Receivables list in the Business Center
Here’s how to record a payment using the Receivables list:
1. Display the Business Center.
Open the Business Center by choosing Business➪Business Center from
the menu or by clicking on the Business Center in the Account Bar at the
left side of the screen. Be sure that the My Data tab is selected.
2. Click on the receivable for which you have received payment.
Find the Accounts Receivable (Unpaid Invoices) section of the Business
Center screen. You see a list of all of your accounts receivables. The
names of the payees for the invoices are hyperlinked. You can click right
on a name to open the customer’s invoice. If the list is too long to display
in the business center, click the Show Full List option. The complete list of
receivables appears in its own window. Double-clicking on a name opens
the invoice for that customer.
3. Open the Customer Payment window.
With the customer’s invoice open, click the Receive Pmt button. From
here, go to step 5 in Method 1 and continue.
Method 3: Using the Record a Payment button
Here’s how to record a payment using the Record a Payment button.
1. With the Business Center open and the My Data tab selected, click
the Record a Payment button that appears in the Accounts Receivable
section.
2. The Customer Payment window appears, with no customer or invoice
selected (Figure 2-12).
3. Select the customer from whom you have received payment.
Click the drop-down list in the Customer field to see a list of all customers
to whom you have ever issued invoices. Click on the name of the customer
who sent you a payment. As soon as you click on a different field, or press
Tab to move to a different field, the invoices that are outstanding from this
customer appear in a list at the bottom of the Customer Payment window.
4. Enter the amount you received.
Enter the amount in the Amount field. Quicken automatically assigns this
amount to outstanding invoices, the oldest invoice first and then the next
oldest, and so on, as you can see in Figure 2-13.
5. Verify the application of the money.
If for some reason you want to apply the amount you received to an
invoice other than the one(s) selected by Quicken, you can change the
amounts in the Payment column, applying the correct amount to each
invoice.

6. Complete the entry of payment information.
Pick up with step 5 from Method 1, verifying the date and bank account
and then recording the deposit.
Dealing with bad debts
When customers don’t pay you, you have what is known in the accounting
world as a bad debt. If you’ve issued an invoice in Quicken for an amount
that has gone bad, you need to clear your system of the invoice; otherwise,
your income is going to reflect an amount that you know you’re not going to
receive.
Figure 2-13:
Make sure
the money
you
received 
is applied 
to the
appropriate
invoices.

The quick and easy way to remove the bad invoice is simply to do that —
remove the invoice. Find the invoice, delete it, and you’re done. Fini. But the
proper way to remove the bad invoice, from an accounting perspective, where
everything is supposed to be, well, accounted for, is to keep the invoice but
remove the receivable. Not only does this method preserve the record of how
you were attempting to earn a living and remain in your Quicken file as a
reminder of who you probably don’t want to do business with again in the
future, but should the customer suddenly have a change of heart (or a change
of fortune) and send you the money, you still have the invoice intact and
retrievable.
Follow these steps to issue a credit that relieves your receivables of the
amount owing to you but preserves the record of the event in your file:
1. Open the Business Center and select the My Data tab.
2. Open the register for your invoices/receivables.
In the Business Center, under the heading Business Accounts, you see
your Customer Invoices (or whatever you named it) account. Click the
hyperlink to display the register for this account.
3. Open the Credit window.
In the invoices/receivables register, click the Create New menu at the
top, and then choose Credit. The Credit window appears (Figure 2-14).
Figure 2-14:
Enter the
original
invoice
number and
the amount

4. Select the customer name.
Choose from the drop-down list to enter the customer name in the
Customer field.
5. Enter the original invoice number and the amount of the bad debt.
Here’s one place where you’re going to wish Quicken were more of an
advanced accounting program. It would be really nice if Quicken dis-
played for you all of the outstanding invoices for this customer. Instead,
you need to know the invoice number from the amount you are writing
off. If you don’t have the number handy, you can close this window, find
the invoice back in the register, and then reopen the window and start
over again.
6. Enter the bad debt information.
Down in the Category field of the Credit form, choose Bad Debt as the
category for this transaction. Enter the amount you are writing off in
the Amount field, as shown in Figure 2-14. Enter the amount without
a minus sign. Quicken knows this is a credit instead of an income
amount.
7. Open the Customer Payment window.
Click the Receive Pmt button and you should see a little box warning
you that you have entered a duplicate number (Figure 2-15). This is
because your Credit Memo number is the same as the Invoice number
you entered previously. Go ahead and click OK, and the Customer
Payment window appears.
8. Apply the credit to the outstanding invoices.
See the credit amount in the middle of the window? Check the box to
Apply Existing Credits to the outstanding invoices (see Figure 2-16). 
The amount of the bad debt (or credit, as Quicken is calling it here) is
instantly applied to the customer’s oldest invoice first, and then any
remainder is applied to the next oldest invoice, and so on.
Figure 2-15:
Click OK to
move on to
the next
step.

9. Record the bad debt.
Click Enter to record the bad debt. The invoice(s) remains in your
Invoices/Receivables register, but it is marked as cleared.
Sample Quicken reports throughout the receivables process
Tracking your receivables is easy when you can produce reports showing all
of the amounts owing to you. Produce a receivables report in Quicken Home
& Business by opening the Reports & Graphs Center, and then clicking
Accounts Receivable, found in the Business category.
Figure 2-16:
Check the
box to apply

Tax ramifications of a bad debt
If you are a cash basis taxpayer and you record
a bad debt in your Quicken records, that event
has no effect on your tax return. Because you
are a cash basis taxpayer, you don’t record
income on your tax return until you actually
receive the income. Recording the bad debt
has the effect of clearing the invoice in your
Quicken file, but because the income wasn’t
recorded on your tax return, you get no tax ben-
efit from recording the bad debt.
If you are an accrual basis taxpayer, and a bad
debt occurs, the bad debt is recorded as an
expense for tax purposes. This is because the
invoice amount has been recorded with your
income for tax purposes. You certainly don’t
want to pay income tax on the income from a
bill you’ll never collect, thus the income is offset
by the bad debt and there is no tax effect.

The only report available to you in Quicken’s Accounts Receivable section of
the report list is the Payments Due by Customer report (see Figure 2-17).
Enter a date range, and then click Show Report to display the A/R by
Customer report that lists each customer and the amount of receivables for
the designated date range.
By default, the A/R by Customer report displays each customer with a
receivables column for each month. You can change the column display to
something other than month by clicking the Column drop-down list at the
top of the report and making a different choice. I prefer the Don’t Subtotal
option. That provides me with a total amount due for each customer. I can
click on the amount due to see a detailed report showing what makes up
that total amount for each customer.
Another A/R report I like is the Customer Invoices report. Not found on
the standard reports menu, the Customer Invoices report appears when
you display your Net Worth report (located in the Net Worth & Balances
group on the standard reports list), and then double-click on the Customer
Invoices amount on that report. The Customer Invoices report appears
(see Figure 2-18), showing all outstanding invoices as of the date of your
Net Worth report. Double-click on any invoice listed in the report to view
the actual invoice.

Using Quicken’s Accounts Payable Feature
704
Using Quicken’s Accounts Payable Feature
Accounts Payable are basically the reverse of Accounts Receivable —
instead of someone owing money to you, you owe money to someone else. 
If you are an accrual basis taxpayer, you are required to track receivables.
Even if you aren’t an accrual basis taxpayer, tracking payables in Quicken
provides you with a nice way to keep track of how much money you owe, to
whom, and when the payments are due.
Payables appear in your Quicken Net Worth reports as a liability, and, in the
Business Center, you can always see your outstanding payables.
Quicken Home & Business provides the tools you need to record and track
accounts payable. The first order of business in working with accounts
payable is to create a payables account. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Open the Account Setup window.
You can go to the Business Center and click on the Add a Business Bills
Account hyperlink (see Figure 2-19). Or, you can open the Account List
by pressing Ctrl+A, and then clicking Add Account. Indicate that this
account is not held at a financial institution and click Next. When the
list appears showing all the types of accounts, choose Bills/Payables.
Figure 2-18:

2. Give the account a name.
Quicken has pre-selected Business Bills as your account name. You can
use this, or choose another name if you prefer.
You might want to set up two bills accounts — one for business bills and
one for personal bills.
3. Wrap it up.
Click Next and you’re finished. Wow! That was incredibly easy!
Receiving a bill
Say you’ve got your bills/payables account all set up and ready to use. Now
you just have to go to the mailbox to see if you’ve got any bills to enter. This
is probably the only time in your life you’re going to look forward to getting
bills in the mailbox!
The idea behind using the bills/payables account is that when you receive
a bill, the amount gets entered immediately in Quicken. Not only does this
ensure that you’ll get a reminder telling you to pay your bill on time, but by
entering the amount you owe in your Quicken file, your financial statements
show a truer picture of your finances. Now not only do you see what you
spent on your finances, but you also see what you have committed to pay for.
Figure 2-19:

Using Quicken’s Accounts Payable Feature

Here’s how to proceed when you receive a bill:
1. Open the Bill window.
Take your pick — there are (at least) three ways to open a new bill
window.
• From the menu: choose Business➪Bills and Vendors➪Create Bill.
• From the Bills register: Click the Create New drop-down menu and
choose Bill.
• From the Business Center, on the My Data tab: Click the Create a 
Bill button, or, click the Options drop-down menu across from the
Accounts Payable heading and choose Create a Bill.
2. Enter the vendor name.
In the Vendor field (see Figure 2-20), you need to enter the name of the
person or company that sent you the bill. You can’t continue entering
information on the bill until you make an entry here. Quicken saves the
vendor name that you enter, so the next time you create a bill, you’ll see
this vendor added to the list of other vendors on the Vendor drop-down
list. If this is the first bill you’ve ever entered, this vendor is the only
entry on the list.
3. Enter the vendor address.
In the Vendor Address field, enter the mailing address where the payment
is to be sent. Quicken remembers this address as you enter it, so the next
time you enter a bill from this vendor, the address appears automatically.
Figure 2-20:

4. Verify the date.
Quicken automatically enters today’s date in the date field. You should
decide what date you want to use when you enter bills. You can either use
today’s date, the date the bill was received in the mail, or the actual date
on the bill. Entering the date on the actual bill in most cases gives you the
greatest assurance of having the correct due date entered on the bill.
5. Verify the due date.
Like I said before, if you used the actual bill date as the date in step 4,
Quicken automatically calculates 30 days from that date as the due date.
Check the due date on the bill and make sure 30 days is correct, or change
the due date if necessary. This is the date Quicken uses for reminders, so
you want to make sure this date is correct. That way, you are reminded to
pay the bill on time and can avoid potential late charges.
6. Enter the bill number.
The bill number is the number on the vendor’s bill — this is not a number
generated by Quicken. Each vendor has its own bill numbering system, so
these numbers are not chronological like your invoice numbers are.
7. Enter the P.O. number.
This step is optional. If you use purchase orders and your purchase
orders have numbers, you can enter the P.O. number here for your own
reference. This field is purely for your own information and doesn’t tie
into any other forms in Quicken.
8. Enter the category.
In the Category field, you need to pick the category where this expense
should be recorded. Click the drop-down arrow to see your company’s
complete category list. If you need to set up a new category, just enter
the category name here, and you get to add the category to your list.
9. Enter a description.
Enter the description of the item(s) you purchased. You can use the
description that appears on the actual bill you received, or embellish it
to explain in more detail what you actually purchased.
The bill is for your use only, so you can enter any description that you
want.
10. Enter the amount.
Enter the total amount of the bill in the Amount column. This is the
amount you plan to pay.
If you plan to pay less than the amount shown on the bill (for example, due
to a dispute over the price or a discount for early payment), I recommend
you enter the full amount of the bill first, and then on the next line, enter
the reduction and a description of why the amount is reduced. The reduc-
tion amount gets entered as a negative number in the amount column.

Using Quicken’s Accounts Payable Feature

11. Enter an optional memo.
At the bottom of the bill is a Memo field. You can place any information
you want in this field — it is for your use only.
12. Save the bill.
Click Save and Done to close the bill window. Click Save and New if you
have another bill to enter. In either case, the bill is saved and entered in
your Bills register.
Paying your bills
Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just enter bills and not have to worry about
paying them too? Fat chance. Bills need to be paid, and here’s how to execute
that task fairly painlessly. Just like with the methods we discussed earlier 
for recording the receipt of payments, there are three ways to record the pay-
ment of a bill.
Method 1: Using the Bills register
Here’s how to record payment using the Bills register:
1. Display the Bills register.
From the menu, choose Business➪Business Accounts➪Business Bills (or
whatever you named your bills account). Or, open the Business Center,
display the My Data tab, and under Business Accounts, click on the
hyperlink to the Business Bills account. Or, over on the Account Bar at
the left side of the screen, under the Business Center heading, click on
the Business Bills account.
2. Click on the transaction for which you want send a payment.
You can scroll through the register to find the right transaction, or you
can use the Find feature to find a particular transaction in the register.
Or, try one of the other two methods presented here if your list of
payables is long and unwieldy.
3. Click the Form button.
Enter, Edit, and Form buttons are in the register on the right side of the
transaction. Click the Form button or the little green checkmark, and the
original bill appears.
4. Open the Payment to Vendor window.
On the original bill that appears, click the Create Payment button. The
bill disappears from your screen and the Payment to Vendor window
appears (Figure 2-21).

5. Verify the payment amount and date.
Today’s date appears in the date field, and the full amount of the bill
appears in the payment field. Verify that today is the date on which the
payment is to be made, or change the date if necessary. If you plan to
pay some amount other than the full amount, enter the actual amount
you want to pay.
6. Enter bank account information.
In the Withdraw From field, choose the account from which the payment
is to be made.
7. Fill in the Check Number field.
When you click the drop-down list in the Check Number field, you see
there are options for selecting the next available check number, elec-
tronic payment, and so on. Pick the option that applies to how you want
to make this payment.
8. Complete the transaction.
Click Enter. The Payment to Vendor window closes. The bill is marked as
Cleared in your Bills register. The amount is recorded in the bank account
you selected, with the payment method you selected.
The payment still needs to be dispatched. Depending on the method you
chose, you must initiate the electronic transfer or print a check. Look
back at Book IV, Chapter 4 for more information on payment of bills.
Figure 2-21:
Record your
payment.

Using Quicken’s Accounts Payable Feature
710
Method 2: Using the Payables list in the Business Center
Here’s how to record payment using the Payables list:
1. Display the Business Center.
Open the Business Center by choosing Business➪Business Center from
the menu or by clicking on the Business Center in the Account Bar at the
left side of the screen. Be sure that the My Data tab is selected.
2. Click on the bill that you want to pay.
Find the Accounts Payable (Business Bills) section of the Business Center
screen. You’ll see a list of all of your payables. The names of the vendors
for the bills are hyperlinked. You can click right on a name to open the
related bill. If the list is too long to display in the Business Center, click
the Show Full List option. The complete list of bills appears in its own
window. Double-clicking on a name opens the bill from that vendor.
3. Open the Payment to Vendor window.
With the bill open, click the Create Payment button. From here, go to
step 4 in Method 1 and continue.
Method 3: Using the Make Payment button
Here’s how to record payment using the Make Payment button:
1. With the Business Center open and the My Data tab selected, click the
Make Payment button that appears in the Accounts Payable section.
2. The Payment to Vendor window appears, with no bill selected
(Figure 2-22).

3. Select the vendor from whom you have received a bill.
Click the drop-down list in the Vendor field to see a list of all vendors
from whom you have ever entered bills. Click on the name of the vendor
who sent you the bill. As soon as you click on a different field, or press
Tab to move to a different field, the bills that are outstanding from this
vendor appear in a list at the bottom of the Payment to Vendor window.
4. Enter the amount you want to pay.
Enter the amount you plan to pay in the Amount field. Quicken automati-
cally assigns this amount to outstanding bills, the oldest bill first and
then the next oldest, and so on, as you can see in Figure 2-23.
5. Verify the application of the money.
If, for some reason, you want to apply the payment to a bill other than
the one(s) selected by Quicken, you can change the amounts in the
Payment column, applying the correct amount to each bill.
6. Complete the entry of payment information.
Pick up with step 5 from Method 1, verifying the date and bank account
and then recording the payment.

Chapter 3: Tracking 
Jobs and Payroll
In This Chapter

 Issuing estimates

B
usinesses can take advantage of special Quicken features to keep track
of individual projects and also to compute payroll. Project-oriented
businesses include businesses that perform work on a per-client basis, such
as legal and accounting and other professional services, construction com-
panies, Web-design companies, and many, many more. As for payroll, if your
payroll is just a few people, you might not need an actual payroll program
like the one Quicken offers. But if you have more than a few employees, or if
you’re not entirely familiar with payroll tax requirements and want the assur-
ance provided by using a program instead of figuring out payroll yourself,
Quicken’s payroll program might be just the ticket for you. You can track
both jobs and payroll without the add-ons of Quicken Home & Business and
QuickPayroll. In this chapter, I show you how to track these facets of your
business both ways; you can decide which method is the most useful for
your business.
Keeping Track of Your Projects
Some work naturally separates itself into individual projects. Other work is
viewed as a whole. In the last chapter, I used the example of a catering com-
pany. A caterer who works for one client at a time, one event at a time, can
gain a better understanding of the business profitability by tracking all of
the expenses and related income from each project, separately. An artist
who paints for a living, on the other hand, might purchase art supplies that
are used on many different projects — trying to track the expenses for each
individual work of art would be nearly impossible.

Keeping Track of Your Projects
714
If your business lends itself to organization by jobs, you might want to take a
look at Quicken Home & Business for its job-tracking capabilities. If you only
have a small number of jobs, consider using separate categories for each
job’s expenses, or assign a separate class to each job.
Here are some advantages to tracking your income and expenses on a per-
job basis:
✦You can assess the profitability of each job individually, thus helping you
decide if certain jobs are worth the time and money you invest.
✦You can produce work-in-progress reports on a per-job basis to deter-
mine how your expenses compare to your income while the job is still in
progress.
✦You can produce a report showing all the expenses on a particular job to
show to the customer or client who needs to know your costs.
✦You can compare your costs on a job to your preliminary estimate to see
how close you came to your estimate and determine if your estimating
procedures are accurate.
Setting up your Project/Job list
In the Home & Business program, Quicken uses the terms project and job
interchangeably, and I do too. You can use whichever name you prefer, or
you might even call your jobs something completely different, like pieces, 
or cases, or tasks, or activities. It doesn’t matter what name you use — the
process for working with these projects is the same. Here I show you how 
to set up a project in Quicken Home & Business.
1. Open the Business Center.
Either choose Business➪Go to Business Center from the menu, or click on
the Business Center on the Account Bar at the left side of your screen.
2. Click the Analysis and Reports tab.
3. Open the Project/Job List link.
Click the hyperlink to Project/Job List on the right side of the screen.
The Project/Job list appears, and any projects you already have entered
in Quicken appear on the list.
Instead of going through the Business Center, you could choose
Business➪Business Lists➪Project/Job List from the menu.
4. Open the New Project/Job window.
Click the New button at the top of the Project/Job List window. The 
New Project/Job window appears, ready for you to enter information
(see Figure 3-1).

5. Enter the customer name.
You can click the drop-down arrow to see the existing customer list.
Click on one of the customer names to select that customer. If the cus-
tomer for whom you are doing this job doesn’t appear on the list, you
can enter the name of a new customer. Quicken automatically adds the
new customer to the list for future use.
6. Enter the job name in the Project/Job box.
Enter the name you want to use for this job. The name might be a case
number, or a descriptive name.
7. Enter the job status.
Quicken provides you with a Status drop-down list of five possible sta-
tuses: Awarded, Closed, In Progress, Not Awarded, Pending. You can pick
from these job statuses, or you can enter a different job status. If you want
to add to the job status list, click the New/Edit button. The Project/Job
Status window appears (see Figure 3-2). Click on a status you want to
change, and then enter the new status name in the Status to Add/Replace
field. Click either the Replace button to replace the original status with
your new name or the Add button to add your new status to the others 
on the list. Click OK when you’re finished making your changes.
Job status is an optional choice. If you don’t want to use a job status,
just select <None> as your Job Status.
8. Enter a description.
The description is optional, but entering a narrative description gives
you an opportunity to elaborate a little about the particular project.
9. Enter appropriate dates in the three date-related fields.
The Start date is the date on which you started or expect to start the
project. The Projected End date is the date when you expect the project
will be completed. If you are entering information about a job you’ve
already completed, you can enter the Actual End date as well.
Figure 3-1:

You can choose to Edit a job on the Project/Job list by clicking on a job
and then clicking the Edit button at the top of the list. The Edit Project/
Job window appears. When you’ve completed a job, you can edit the job
to enter the actual ending date and to change the status to show the job
is finished.
10. Close the New Project/Job window.
Click the OK button and the window closes, the project is added to your
Project/Job list, and you are now ready to start assigning income and
expenses to this job.
If you don’t have Quicken Home & Business, you can use Quicken’s
Classes feature to track individual projects. Classes are available with 
all versions of Quicken.

Factors to consider when tracking job information
Tracking jobs is more than just keeping good
records. Here are some points to consider
when examining the progress on your jobs:
 Based on your original estimate of the job
cost and amount of time needed to complete
the job, you can use job tracking to deter-
mine what percent of the job is completed,
and how much money and time is left to
expend.
 If you plan on billing your customer as the
job progresses instead of all at once, a
progress report created from the transac-
tions that relate to a particular job can be
quite useful.
 You can track your accounts receivable by
job and see at a glance on the Project/Job
list which expenses you’ve been reimbursed
for and where you’ve spent money with no
reimbursement.

Working with jobs
After you’ve set up some jobs (if you haven’t, no matter, you can create your
jobs as you need to use them), it’s time to see how to apply a transaction to
a particular job. Say you own a catering company. Your company is prepar-
ing to cater a business luncheon for 50 people and is purchasing some of the
food necessary for that function. Here’s a sample transaction:
1. Go to the store, call your supplier, send an order form by mail or fax,
or make an Internet order.
Ah — I think you can figure out that step without my help!
2. Receive the bill.
OK — you remember how to enter bills, right? If not, check back to the
previous chapter, and then report back here. Enter the bill as you nor-
mally would, but before you close the window, go on to the next step.
3. Enter the Project name.
Click the Assign Project/Job button at the top of the Bill window. The
Select Project/Job window appears (Figure 3-3). Click on the project
name, and then click the OK button. If the project hasn’t been set up 
yet in Quicken, click the New button, set up the project, and then come
back here.
4. Save your bill.
When you close the Select Project/Job window, the customer name and
the project name appear at the top of your bill (Figure 3-4). Go ahead and
click one of the Save options to close the Bill window and save the bill.

5. Check out the results.
Display the Project/Job list (remember you can find this on the Analysis &
Reports tab of the Business Center). The bill you just entered has been
added to the expenses for the particular job, as shown in Figure 3-5.

Chapter 3

When you enter expenses that relate to multiple jobs, be sure to take the
time to split the transaction and assign the appropriate amounts to each
job. In the long run, this provides you with much more accurate and
useful information, even if it takes a little extra time up front to record
the transaction.
Recording income on projects
The process of recording income on a project is nearly identical to recording
a bill. When you open the invoice form, the first thing you do is choose a
customer name. As soon as you pick a customer, a drop-down arrow appears
in the Project/Job field, and the accompanying list shows all projects
assigned to that customer (see Figure 3-6).
As with entering bills, when you enter an invoice that is tied to a particular
project, you can see the results immediately in the Project/Job list. The
income from the invoice has been added to that particular job.
Seeing how a project is progressing
Quicken Home & Business comes with some built-in project reports so you
can track the progress of your projects as you incur expenses and send
invoices that relate to particular projects.
Choose Business from the Reports menu, and you’ll see there are two Project/
Job reports available. The first, Project/Job, shows your income and expenses
Figure 3-6:
The list of
projects 
for the
customer
you enter

when you
click the
drop-down
arrow.

Keeping Track of Your Projects
720
organized by class, with a separate column for each class. The second report,
Project/Job by Project, shows your income and expenses with a separate
column for each project. Whether you use classes or projects to define your
jobs, there is a standard report for you.
You can customize the project reports by clicking the Customize button, and
then identifying what information you want to see. For example, if you only
want to see income and expenses from particular categories that relate to
your projects, click the Categories tab in the Customize window and select
the categories you want to see displayed on the report.
Creating job estimates
An estimate is an approximation of how much you expect to charge a cus-
tomer for a particular project. You can prepare an actual estimate form in
Quicken that you can give to your customers. As the job progresses, the esti-
mate form can be converted to an invoice. Once again, the estimate is a fea-
ture of Quicken Home & Business. If you don’t have the Home & Business
version, you are stuck with creating your estimates on paper.
Here’s a step-by-step introduction to setting up an estimate form:
1. Open the Business Center.
2. Click the Analysis & Reports tab.
3. Click on the Estimate List link.
The Estimate List link appears over in the Tools list on the right side of
the Analysis & Reports tab (see Figure 3-7).
4. Click the New button.
The Estimate form appears. This form is quite similar to Quicken’s
Invoice form. If you’ve already worked with Quicken invoices, you may
have noticed that the steps in creating an estimate are familiar.
There are a few differences between the estimate and the invoice forms.
The estimate form doesn’t include a shipping address, a due date field, or
a P.O. number field, which are all fields you’ll find on the invoice form.
Also, the invoice form includes buttons to record the receipt of payment,
a payment history summary, and an opportunity to apply expenses.
5. Enter the customer name.
There is a drop-down list in the Customer field at the top of the Estimate
form. If you’ve already entered this customer’s name on another Quicken
form, the name appears on the drop-down list. For new customers, enter
the name and Quicken automatically remembers it for the next time you
want to use it.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Tracking Jobs 
and Payroll
Keeping Track of Your Projects
721
Consider whether you want to enter your customer names by last name
first or first name first, and then use the same method for entering all of
your customer names. That consistency makes it easier to search lists
and reports to find particular customers.
6. Enter a project or job name.
If you have entered other project names for this customer, the drop-down
list in the Project/Job field is populated with these names. If this is the
first time you’ve worked on a project for this customer, the drop-down list
is empty. You can choose from any existing project names on the drop-
down list, or enter a new name. In Figure 3-8, for example, I’ve entered a
new project name, Dinner Party, for my sample catering company. If you
enter a new name, you are prompted to set up the new project/job, as
described in step 7.
7. Click Yes to create the new project/job.
This step only appears if you are entering a new project/job for this cus-
tomer. You are asked if you want to create the new project/job. Clicking
Yes allows you to proceed to the setup screen explained in step 8. You
must set up the project if you want to use that project name on your
estimate.
8. Enter information about your project/job.

Click

list of your
active
estimates.
From there,
click New 
to open 
a new

form.

When you click Yes in step 7, the New Project/Job window appears
(Figure 3-9). Enter the name of the project. If you use Quicken’s job status
feature (described in “Setting up your Project/Job list,” earlier in this
chapter), you can enter a status. Because this is an estimate and not yet
an actual job, you’ll probably use the Pending status. Any other entries,
such as job description and date information, are optional. Click OK to
complete the setup process.
9. Enter your customer’s address.
The address is optional but useful if you plan to mail this estimate. Also,
after you enter the address, Quicken remembers that address and auto-
matically places it on future forms created for this customer.

10. Verify the date.
Quicken automatically places today’s date on the estimate form. You can
change the date if you want.
11. Verify the estimate number.
After you’ve created your first estimate in Quicken and assigned a number
to that estimate, Quicken automatically fills in the Estimate # field on
future estimates with the next chronological number.
12. Enter the estimate descriptions and amounts.
In the lower portion of the estimate form, enter the details of what you
expect to charge the customer for this job. Each item you enter must be
set up in Quicken (see Chapter 2, Book VIII for more information about
using and setting up items). The completed estimate shown in Figure 3-8
includes one item for Catering.
13. Verify quantity, rate, and amount.
If you are estimating the cost of multiple quantities of an item, enter the
quantity in the Qty field on the estimate form. If you have already entered
a rate for this item when you created the item in Quicken, the rate auto-
matically appears on the estimate form and the amount is calculated
based on the quantity that you enter. You can change the rate that
appears on the form, or enter a rate if the rate field is blank.
14. Verify sales tax.
If you charge sales tax and want to include that charge on your estimate,
verify that the correct rate appears in the Tax field at the bottom of the
estimate form. Also, verify that the items that qualify for sales tax are
marked with a T in the T column to the right of the Amount column on
the estimate. Quicken calculates the sales tax based on the tax rate and
the taxable items shown on the form.
15. Enter an optional customer message.
When creating estimates, the customer message area is a necessary
field. Make sure you indicate in this field the expiration date for your
estimate, or use a standard phrase that describes the life expectancy of
the estimate. Phrases such as “Prices good for 60 days from the date on
this form” and “Estimate will expire on 10/31/06” provide you with some
protection from having a customer come back two years later trying to
get the job done for outdated prices.
I strongly recommend that you use the message section of the estimate
to enter a termination date for the estimate. Rather than leaving the esti-
mate open-ended, you should let the customer how long you expect to
honor the price information provided in the estimate.

Keeping Track of Your Projects
724
16. Send the estimate.
You can click the Print button to print a copy of the estimate for deliv-
ery, or you can click the E-mail/Clipboard option and the Send Estimate
by E-mail window appears (Figure 3-10). Verify the e-mail information,
enter the customer’s e-mail address if necessary, and then click OK. You
are asked to provide some information about your own e-mail address
and server if this is the first time you’ve e-mailed anything from Quicken.
After all the information is entered, an e-mail message appears allowing
you the option for entering personal comments. Click the Send button
on this message and your estimate is dispatched!
17. Save the estimate.
Click Save and Done or Save and New to save the estimate. The first
option closes the estimate window; the second option opens a new esti-
mate window and you can start all over again with a new estimate. In
both cases, the estimate is saved and appears on your Estimate List 
(see step 3).
You might be thinking, “Whoa! This estimate looks like an invoice! Have I just
increased my reported income by the amount on the estimate?” Well, no,
silly. That’s why it’s an estimate. It’s just a formalized document that shows
what you’ve been thinking. No financial transaction is associated with an
estimate, and therefore no financial transaction is carried out in Quicken
when you create an estimate. The estimate is purely for your information, for
your customer’s information, and for you to use going forward as a guide to
your performance on a task.
At any time you can view your outstanding estimates by clicking the
Estimate List link in the Business Center.

Tracking Payroll in Quicken
If you have employees, you need to prepare and keep track of payroll infor-
mation. It’s imperative that you get this right — your employees are relying
on you to file the correct forms, pay the correct amounts of taxes on their
behalf, and prepare year-end forms for them so they can prepare their
income tax returns.
You can use an outside payroll service to perform payroll duties, or you can
do the work yourself. If you prepare your own payroll, you can either create
the computations yourself or you can use Quicken’s QuickPayroll to make
your payroll chore easier.
QuickPayroll isn’t cheap, at least not in comparison to what you paid 
for your Quicken software. When this book went to press, the price of
QuickPayroll was $129 per year. If you only have a few employees, you might
not be able to justify the price of this payroll service. If you want to give the
service a try, Quicken lets you subscribe for 30 days at no charge. If you
don’t cancel before the 30 days expire, you are charged the $129. See for
yourself if you like the service well enough to pay for it.
Quicken’s QuickPayroll: What’s in the box?
If you’re curious about QuickPayroll, you 
can go to the Web site and find out more 
about the program: www.payroll.com/
quickpayroll. QuickPayroll offers the fol-
lowing features:
 The program doesn’t need to be used with
Quicken — it is a standalone program. You
can use a different computer for payroll
than you do for your Quicken program if
you want.
 Information from QuickPayroll can be seam-
lessly incorporated into your Quicken pro-
gram so your Quicken accounts will be up to
date.
 All federal and state taxes are automatically
calculated with the QuickPayroll program.
 You can print paychecks from the Quick-
Payroll program.
 QuickPayroll provides you with payroll
reports summarizing your payroll and pay-
roll tax activity.
 Any changes in either federal or state tax
rates that occur at any time during the year
can be downloaded into your QuickPayroll
program at no additional charge.
 Security is available in the form of pass-
word protection for your QuickPayroll data.

If you’ve decided to go it alone and calculate and enter your own payroll
information, I can help you get everything set up in Quicken. You need to
create some new categories and accounts, and you’ll want to set up some
reminders so that you don’t lose track of how much tax you have to pay,
what forms you need to prepare, to whom, and when.
I’m going to discuss federal income taxes here. It would take a whole book and
time that I don’t have to discuss all of the state regulations because each state
has its own distinct rules. In addition, many cities assess income taxes. And
that doesn’t even begin to address foreign considerations if you have interna-
tional employees. The more complex your tax situation is, the more necessary
an outside tax professional is. But I’ll bet you already know that. 
New accounts you need
You need to keep track of and pay four federal taxes throughout the year.
Some of these taxes you’re going to withhold from your employee’s pay, and
some of them you’re going to pay yourself. Here’s the rundown:
✦Federal income tax withholding: This is the income tax that you with-
hold from your employees. The IRS and Congress have gotten together
to create a great little booklet called Circular E, which is filled with page
after page of tax tables guaranteed to put you to sleep at night, as well
as other useful information about all the taxes you need to pay and with-
hold. You can download a copy of Circular E at www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/p15.pdf.
Contact the IRS and your state government 
to find out filing requirements
 You must apply for a Federal ID number if
you plan to withhold and pay payroll taxes.
To do so, you need to fill out federal form
SS-4, Application for Employer Identifica-
tion Number, and submit the form to the
IRS. Shortly thereafter, the IRS sends you
a packet of information about how and
when to remit income taxes withheld from
your employees as well as Social Security
tax, Medicare tax, and federal unemploy-
ment tax.
 Your state expects you to report employee
earnings information to the state govern-
ment as well. You should check with your
state government to find out how to collect
and remit income and unemployment taxes
in your state.

✦Social Security tax: Otherwise known as FICA, half of this tax is withheld
at a flat 6.2 percent of your employee’s wages. The other half, another
6.2 percent of the wages of each of your employees, is paid by you
because you’re kind and generous and, oh yeah, you like to obey the law.
✦Medicare tax: You withhold 1.45 percent of your employee’s wages to
pay for half of the Medicare tax. The other half, another 1.45 percent of
the wages of each employee, is paid by you.
✦Federal unemployment tax: No withholding for this one. You as the
employer pay the federal share, and oh, by the way, don’t forget to check
with your state to find out how much unemployment tax you have to
pay at the state level. Some states let you withhold the state unemploy-
ment tax from your employees; others make you pay it yourself. It’s all
the same, right? One assumes that employees’ wages are slightly lower
in states where the employer pays the tax, and higher if the employees
pay the tax themselves.
You need to set up liability accounts to handle these taxes — here’s how:
1. Open the Account List.
Choose Account List from the Tools menu or press Ctrl+A. The Account
List appears, ready for you to take some action.
2. Open the Account Setup window.
From the Account List window, click the Add Account option at the top,
or press Alt+A. The Account Setup window appears.
3. Indicate that this is not a bank account.
Choose door number 2, This Account Is Not Held at a Financial
Institution. Click Next to continue.
4. Choose Liability.
That’s right — these are liability accounts we’re setting up. Liability, if
you recall, means you owe money. You’re going to use these accounts 
to keep track of the tax money you owe to Uncle Sam. Click Next to 
continue.
5. Give the account a name.
You’ve got four of these to take care of, one at a time. Table 3-1 provides
some sample names you can use, or you can make up your own. Just
make sure you use names that make sense so you can find your way
back to these accounts without any trouble.

If you want to go ahead and set up liability accounts for your state taxes
at this time as well, feel free.
Quicken searches through your account names when preparing its
Payroll report and includes all accounts with the word Payroll contained
in the name; therefore, I use the word Payroll in all of my payroll-related
account names.
7. Enter a date and the amount you owe.
You can’t leave the date field blank, so enter today’s date, or the date
when the most recent tax payment period ended. Enter whatever the
current amount is that you owe for this particular payroll tax (see Fig-
ure 3-11). Are your payments all caught up? Then enter zero.
8. Finish the setup.
Click the Done button to complete the setup. You’ll be asked if you want
to create an amortized loan for the amount owing. This is a standard
question whenever you set up a liability account, but this doesn’t have
anything to do with your payroll tax liabilities, so click No.

9. Start over again.
Go back to square one and start the process over again until you’ve set
up all of your payroll liability accounts.
If you use Quicken Home & Business, you can set these liability accounts up
as business payables accounts.
Setting up payroll expense categories
In addition to the payroll liability accounts, you have some payroll expense
categories that need to be created. These are the categories you use to keep
track of your share of the payroll taxes — the amounts you have to pay
beyond what you can withhold from your employees. You should set up the
following categories:
✦Social Security tax expense
✦Medicare tax expense
✦Federal unemployment tax expense
Depending on the rules of your state, you might also have to set up a state
unemployment tax expense category if you pay SUTA to your state.
Set up your payroll expense categories by doing this: 
1. Open the Category List.
Choose Tools➪Category List, or press Ctrl+C (or Shift+Ctrl+C). The
Category List appears, showing every category you’ve created thus far.
The accounts you’ve set up appear in brackets at the very bottom of 
the list.
2. Open the Set Up Category window.
Click the New button, found at the bottom of the list, and the Set Up
Category window appears, as shown in Figure 3-12.
3. Enter the category name in the Name field.
Now for the fooler — you thought you were going to enter a type of tax
for the category name. Not so fast. First start with a top-level category
called Payroll, and then you can group all the payroll stuff under that
parent heading. So Payroll it is.
4. Enter the Type.
Choose Expense as the type for this category. Income would be for pay-
roll that you receive as an employee. Expense is for the payroll and
related expenses you give to others.

5. Enter a tax line.
Are you going to use Quicken to help with your tax return? I certainly
hope so. In that case, you need to pick an appropriate tax line for sum-
marizing your payroll information. For more information on tax lines and
tax returns, see Book V.
6. Finish the job.
Click OK and the new parent category is added to your category list,
ready for you to populate it with baby categories.
7. Repeat the above steps for all of the following categories that need to
be entered as subcategories of the Payroll category:
• Gross wages
• FICA employer’s share
• Medicare employer’s share
• FUTA
• SUTA employer’s share (only use this if you, as the employer, pay the
state unemployment tax yourself)
More payroll setup stuff
You’re almost there! You’ve filed your SS-4 and received your federal identifi-
cation number and information about paying and withholding income taxes.
You probably received a copy of the Circular E in the mail as well (but you
know where to download it even if you don’t have a hard copy). You’ve con-
tacted your state government (and by the way, if you have employees who

live in more than one state, you need to get in touch with the governments
for all of those states to make sure you’ve got all the tax rules straight).
You need to take care of just one more thing: You need to get information
from your employees. You can’t just start withholding arbitrary amounts of
income tax from your employees. The amount of federal and state income
tax you withhold is based on a number of criteria:
✦The marital status of your employees
✦The number of allowances the employees claim on their W-4 forms
✦The frequency with which you pay your employees
Wait a minute — go back to that second item. The one about the W-4 forms.
If you think way back to Book I, Chapter 1, I discussed W-4 forms from the
perspective of you being the employee. Well, now you’re the employer and,
instead of worrying about your own W-4 form, you need to pester your
employees to make sure they fill out those forms and give them to you.
The W-4 form shows you the total number of allowances each employee is
claiming. These allowances play a part in determining how much income tax
to withhold from each paycheck.
You can download your very own copy of Form W-4 from the IRS Web site.
Go to www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf. You can even fill out the W-4
online, and then print a paper copy of the form.
Paying your employees
Now that you’ve got all the information you need, it’s time to try your hand
at actually paying your employees. So here we go — it’s payday!
More federal paperwork
While you’re at it, in addition to the W-4 form,
you need to collect an I-9 form from each of your
employees. This form doesn’t have anything to
do with the monetary part of hiring, but the I-9
usually gets distributed to employees at the
same time they are asked to fill out their W-4
form, so we might as well talk about the form
here.
The I-9, otherwise known as Employment
Eligibility Verification Form, is issued by the U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services depart-
ment. The purpose of the form is to provide a
document attesting that your employees are
U.S. citizens and have the right to work in this
country.
Don’t bother sending these forms anywhere.
You as the employer are required to keep the 
I-9 and the W-4 in a file somewhere at your
place of business.

The starting point for determining your payroll amount and the taxes that
are owed is to calculate the gross wages. Gross wages is the term used to
describe how much an employee earned, based on the salary or wage that
was promised when the employee was hired. A little basic math makes this
task much easier.
✦Salary: If your employee receives a fixed annual salary, divide that salary
by the number of pay periods in the year, and that is the amount of the
gross wages for one paycheck. In other words, if Jimmy is hired at a base
salary of $30,000 per year and you write checks twice a month, that trans-
lates into 24 paychecks per year, so $30,000 divided by 24 = $1,250 per
paycheck. Jimmy, of course, isn’t going to take home anywhere near
$1,250 on his paycheck, but that’s the number you start with. 
✦Wages: If your employee earns a certain wage per hour, the wage
amount is multiplied by the number of hours worked in the pay period
in order to determine the gross wages. So, if Georgie worked 40 hours
per week, for half of a month, that works out to about 86.67 hours for
one pay period. If her hourly rate is $10 per hour, her gross wages for
the pay period are $866.67.
The next step is to determine the tax withholding for each employee. You
can use the tax tables in Circular E to figure this out. Also, you can search for
free withholding calculators on the Internet.
Even if you use the Circular E to calculate your taxes, it can’t hurt to verify
your calculations with an online calculator. The IRS has a withholding calcu-
lator on its Web site at www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=
96196,00.html. Click the Continue to the Withholding Calculator link at
the bottom of the page, and then fill in the blanks as you work through the
calculator.
Using the online calculator at the IRS Web site, I’ve calculated the following
withholding amounts for Jimmy and Georgie. The results appear in Table 3-2.

Note: I’ve used 2005 tax withholding rates to calculate the federal income
tax. Withholding percentages change slightly each year. Be sure you are using
up-to-date withholding tables (a current year Circular E or a withholding cal-
culator that has been kept current) when calculating withholding amounts
for your employees.
The table above shows the amounts that an employer would withhold for
these two employees, based on the circumstances described on these
employees’ W-4 forms, the amount of salary and wages they earn, and the
frequency with which the payments are made.
State income tax, and perhaps local income tax, as well as other types of
deductions might also apply to these employees.
Entering a paycheck in Quicken
When you’ve made all the calculations, and you’re ready to create the check,
here’s how to make the entry in Quicken.
Although you know you’re going to pay an amount to each employee that is
less than the total wages earned, you still need to account for all of the
wages and all of the taxes in Quicken. Don’t just write a check for the net
amount and not record the tax withholding. You need to enter the tax infor-
mation in addition to the salary and wages so that you can properly report
and pay your taxes.
Here are the steps to entering a check for payroll:
1. Open the register for the account from which you are paying the 
payroll.
Click the account name on the Account Bar at the left side of the 
screen. The register appears with your cursor in position to enter a 
new transaction.
2. Enter the date of the paycheck.
Quicken automatically starts with today’s date. If necessary, change the
date to the actual payday.
3. Enter the check number.
If you know the number, enter it now. Or, you can choose Print Check if
you plan to print the check from within Quicken, or enter EFT if this is to
be an electronic payment.
4. Enter the employee name.
The employee name goes in the Payee field. Remember that if you have
QuickFill turned on, the name fills in as soon as you begin typing it.

Tracking Payroll in Quicken
734
5. Enter the amount of the check.
In the Payment field, enter the net amount of the check — the actual
amount you intend to write the check for.
6. Open the Split Transaction window.
Press Ctrl+S to open the Split Transaction window.
7. Enter the gross wages.
Start with the whole enchilada — enter Payroll: Gross Wages as the first
split item, and enter the actual amount of gross wages before deductions
($1,250 in the case of Jimmy in Table 3-2).
8. Enter the taxes withheld.
Enter the federal withholding, the FICA withholding, and the Medicare
withholding. These amounts get entered as negative numbers, reducing
the gross wages to the point where the check detail amount equals the
actual check amount. You can confirm the calculation at the bottom of
the Split Transaction window — your goal is to get the Remainder
amount down to zero. You can see what I’ve done in Figure 3-13.
9. Enter employer taxes.
If you like, you can take this one step further and enter your employer
taxes at this time. You have to enter these amounts sometime and 
it makes sense to take care of these entries all at once, in the same 
transaction. In Figure 3-13, I entered the employer share of FICA and
Medicare. The expense amount equals the amount withheld from the
Figure 3-13:

735
employee’s pay and is entered as a positive number. The liability amount
equals the expense amount and offsets this amount as a negative number.
Thus the remainder balance at the bottom stays at zero, and I’ve taken
care of entering my employer payroll tax expense and liability for this
transaction.
10. Enter state taxes.
Before closing up the split transaction window, enter any state taxes
that you withheld from this employee’s pay as well. That lowers the net
check and increases your liability account for state taxes withheld.
11. Save the check.
Click OK to save the information you entered and to enter the check in
the register.
12. One last step — pass out the paychecks!
Whether you write checks by hand, print checks in Quicken, or electron-
ically transfer the funds, this task must be performed regularly and on
time!

I
bet you’ve acquired plenty of items over the years that you intend to
keep. And I’m not talking about that comfy flannel shirt you “borrowed”
from a former boyfriend, or that turntable that’s buried under an inch of
dust in the garage. I mean real tangible items of value that you could sell for
cash and that increase your value to lenders and investors. I’m talking about
items like cars and houses and computers and furniture — these are items
that have a measurable value, and these are items that you need to take the
time to account for in your Quicken program.
Recording Your Business’s Fixed Assets
Several types of fixed assets should be recorded in Quicken. For example,
personal fixed assets that are associated with a loan, such as a car or a
house, should be recorded along with the loan so you can monitor the bal-
ance of the loan and stay on top of your monthly payments. You’ll find spe-
cific information about entering cars and homes in Book IV. Other assets,
such as your household furniture and personal possessions, can be recorded
in Quicken so that you have a permanent record for insurance purposes. 
See Chapter 3, Book IV for details about entering your personal assets in
Quicken.
The assets you purchase for your business should also be recorded in
Quicken. It’s particularly important to record business assets, including
computers, machinery, and other equipment. Here are some reasons why
you need to keep track of these possessions:
✦The IRS requires you to report the cost of your business assets 
and depreciate that cost a period of years. You find out more about
depreciation later in this chapter.

Recording Your Business’s Fixed Assets
738
✦Any lender or investor will want to see information about all of the
assets that add to the value of your business.
✦To determine the value of your own business, you need to have a record
of the assets you own.
I focus on the business assets in this chapter because the personal assets
have been covered earlier in this volume. Recording fixed assets in Quicken
requires entering the cost of the asset, and recording related depreciation
expense. Sounds like a piece of cake, right? Quicken doesn’t really get into
the whole depreciation picture, so setting up your assets won’t be quite as
easy as you might think. But never fear. You can get the job done!
Excuse me? What’s all this 
I hear about depreciation?
Depreciation expense is a fancy way of saying
that over time your assets deteriorate and lose
value, so you have to account for that loss in
value by reducing the reported value of the
assets.
The U.S. Congress and the Internal Revenue
Service have gone to great lengths to make the
process of calculating depreciation about as
confusing as it can possibly be, but hey, that’s
what we taxpayers pay those folks for. Here,
I’m going to leave the really confusing stuff to
the pros and just cover some easy examples
that you can follow as a guide.
Typically, on business financial statements, fixed
assets are reported at their original cost, and
then a separate line on the financial statement
shows the amount of value that has been whit-
tled away by depreciation. The accumulated
depreciation amounts are deducted from the
asset cost, leaving you with a net fixed asset
value on the financial statements.
Quicken is not quite so accommodating as
more high-powered accounting programs, so
you should skip the accumulated depreciation
account and enter your depreciation reduction
in value right in the asset accounts.
So, for a really simple example, say you pur-
chased a computer that is expected to last for
five years (did I also mention that the IRS has a
very unrealistic view of how long certain assets
really last?). The computer cost $1,000. Each
year we record depreciation of 1⁄5 of the com-
puter’s value or $200. The $200 is reported as an
expense on our profit and loss statement and the
computer appears on the net worth statement at
a reduced amount. At the end of the first year,
the computer would be reported at $800 on the
net worth statement, at the end of the second
year, $600, and so on. By the end of the fifth year,
the computer has no value according to your
financial statements.
By the way, one of the more oddball vagaries of
the tax laws is that all fixed assets are expected
to depreciate in value according to the IRS, even
personal residences and classic cars, which
historically have risen in value each year. Go
figure.

Looks like we need some more categories
Now, set up a category for recording depreciation expense. Keep in mind that
no money is going to pass through this category. Depreciation expense is
strictly a transaction that is reported on paper. No matter. You need the cate-
gory in order to include the amount on your financial statements. Set up your
depreciation expense category by following these steps:
1. Open the Category List.
You can probably do this in your sleep by now, but for the record, choose
Category List from the Tools menu, or press Ctrl+C (or Shift+Ctrl+C).
2. Open the Set Up Category window.
Click the New button that’s hanging around down at the bottom of the
Category List. The set up window appears, front and center.
3. Enter the category name.
Depreciation Expense is the standard name to go with here. Other names
might come to mind, such as Asset Write-Off, Something My Accountant
Knows What to Do With, and so on. But remember, this category is going
to show up on some of your financial reports, so just stick with the
familiar name, as I’ve done in Figure 4-1.
4. Enter a description.
Or not. The description field is optional; however, feel free to use the
Description field to wax eloquent about what you think of the deprecia-
tion category.
Figure 4-1:
Enter
Depre-
ciation

Recording Your Business’s Fixed Assets

5. Choose your category type.
The type is Expense. This is the main depreciation expense category —
the parent category, if you will. If you have lots of different types of assets
and would like to create little baby subcategories to keep track of the
depreciation expense for each asset or each type of asset separately, feel
free to come back later and create more categories, using this one as the
top-level category.
6. Indicate that this is a tax-related category.
You can skip the tax line field. If you scroll through the list of available
tax lines, you see that Quicken doesn’t even bother including a line for
depreciation expense. This is one amount you’re going to have to enter
yourself on your tax return, even if you use the automatic export feature
to send your tax data to TurboTax. Checking the tax-related box, how-
ever, has some value. Quicken includes the depreciation expense on
your tax reports if you check this box.
7. Save the category.
Don’t forget to click OK so your entries can be saved.
Time to go computer shopping!
Now that we’ve got our depreciation expense account created, we can go
ahead and record the acquisition of an asset. I’ll stick with the example of
the computer that I mentioned earlier. Say you go out and purchase a com-
puter for $1,000, and that computer is going to be used in your business.
Here’s how to record the purchase:
1. Open the Account List.
Choose Tools➪Account List from the menu, or press Ctrl+A. The Account
List appears. Just so you know, our new account is going to appear down
in the Property & Debt section, with the Assets.
2. Open the Account Setup window.
Click the Add Account option at the top of the Account List. The
Quicken Account Setup wizard appears.
3. Choose the second option — This Account Is Not Held at a Financial
Institution — and then click Next.
4. Choose the account Type.
Select Asset as the account type (see Figure 4-2). Asset is found in either
the Home & Business group or the Property & Debt group, depending on
which version of Quicken you use.

5. Enter a name for the asset.
Each asset must have a unique name (see Figure 4-3). So if you have
three computers, each one is going to have to go by a different name.
You can use serial numbers, computer models, include the name of the
person whose desk the computer sits on (for example, Katherine’s com-
puter), or maybe tell where the computer is located (Warehouse com-
puter). Whatever name you choose, just make sure you can remember
which computer is which. And this goes for all assets, not just comput-
ers. Each asset account you create must have a name different from all
other accounts.

6. Enter the purchase date.
You’re going to have to ignore the questions in Quicken now and go with
your gut. The Quicken screen shown in Figure 4-4 asks you to indicate
the ending date from your statement. Because you just purchased a fixed
asset, you don’t have an ending date and you don’t have a statement.
Those are questions for a bank account, which this isn’t. The informa-
tion you need to record is the purchase date of the computer, so that’s
what you should enter in the Statement Date field.
7. Enter the asset cost.
The Quicken screen asks you to enter the ending balance on your bank
account. Forget that. You’re going to enter the information you want to
save, and in this case, that is the date on which the asset was purchased.
When you click Done after entering all of the asset information, the
Account Setup wizard disappears and the shiny new asset register
appears in its place.
Recording Depreciation
Usually depreciation is recorded in conjunction with newly issued financial
statements. If you typically produce your company financial statements
monthly, you probably want to record your depreciation expense monthly as
well so your financial statements reflect current depreciation adjustments.

Here’s how to record the depreciation expense for your business asset:
1. Open the register for the asset to be depreciated.
You can find the asset listed on the Account List (Ctrl+A) — just double-
click on the asset name to open the related register.
2. Enter the date.
Determine when you will produce your financial statements, be it monthly,
quarterly, or annually. The date of the depreciation transaction should
coincide with whatever time frame you choose for reporting your busi-
ness activity. So if you produce your financial statements every quarter as
of the last day of the quarter, your depreciation transactions should be
dated March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. In the Asset
register, enter the date for this depreciation transaction. In Figure 4-5, I’ve
entered March 31.
3. Enter a description.
I’ve used Quarterly Depreciation Expense as my description.
To depreciate or not to depreciate
Depreciation is a means of deducting the cost of
assets from your tax return. Assets purchased
for a business represent a business expense.
But often, the expense doesn’t really relate to
just one year of our business activity, so the IRS
expects us to spread the cost over the years
when the asset is to be used in the business.
This cost spreading is called depreciation.
Each business must make its own decisions
regarding which purchases represent ordinary
business costs that get expensed currently and
which expenses represent long-term purchases
that need to be depreciated.
Generally, items that add value to your business
and that are expected to last and be useful in
your business for more than one year should be
depreciated. Often the costlier items you pur-
chase are the items you depreciate. But this
isn’t always the case. I used to own a movie
theatre and I purchased light bulbs for my
movie projector. The bulbs cost close to $1,000
apiece — sounds like a depreciable expense,
right? Wrong! Each bulb only lasted about six
months. These were regular costs of doing
business instead of depreciable costs.
Look more toward how long an asset is going
to last, and then consider the cost. A waste
basket might last 20 years or more, but if it only
costs $10, you don’t have to depreciate it.
When advising my clients, I usually use about
$250 as a cutoff for depreciating items instead
of expensing them. If an item costs less than
$250, I generally recommend expensing the
item instead of recording it as an asset. If the
cost exceeds $250, I advise the client to look 
at the expected longevity of the asset and
whether it adds value to the business to decide
if it needs to be depreciated.

4. Enter the amount.
In the Decrease column, enter the amount of depreciation. In this exam-
ple, I’ve entered $50 as my quarterly depreciation expense.
5. Enter the category.
You set up a depreciation expense category earlier. That is the category
to use for recording this transaction.
6. Record the transaction.
Click the Enter button or press Enter to record your transaction. You’ll see
that the balance of the asset in the far right column has been reduced by
the amount of depreciation expense.
How much depreciation should I report?
The depreciation guide published by the
Internal Revenue Service is 112 pages long.
Reducing all of the material in that guide into a
few paragraphs here is obviously impossible.
So let me instead give you an overview of how
depreciation is calculated. You can then either
use the guide, talk with an accountant, talk with
an IRS representative, or use an online depre-
ciation calculator to determine how much
depreciation expense to enter in your program.
The first part of calculating depreciation
expense is determining the useful life of the
asset. The number of years of useful life
assigned to an asset often has little to do with
how long the asset is actually expected to last.
Buildings last hundreds of years, but the IRS
says that a building should be depreciated over
anywhere from 10 years to 39 years, depending
on the type of building. Automobiles are to be
depreciated over 5 years, as are computers and
cows. Furniture gets a 7-year life expectancy,
whereas fruit trees are expected to last 10 years.
To demonstrate how meaningless these rules are,
back in the 1980s, automobiles were depreciated
over 3 years, furniture was in the 5-year bracket,
and buildings, remarkably, were depreciated over
only 15 years. The actual life expectancy of these
items hasn’t changed — just the way in which
they are treated for tax purposes is different. The
1980s tax rules allowed for much quicker write-
offs of asset purchases, with an eye toward
stimulating economic development.
Anyway, back to the present. There are tables
in the depreciation guide for figuring out how
much to depreciate each year because the cal-
culations are not as straightforward as you
might expect. In fact, they’re pretty darn con-
fusing. An easy way to calculate depreciation
is to use what is known as a straight-line
method, whereby you divide the cost of the
asset over the life of the asset, using the life
expectancy designated by the IRS.
So for a computer that cost $1,000, using the
straight-line method, I’m going to calculate that
the computer has a 5-year life, so I’ll depreciate
$1,000 per year, or $16.67 per month, or $50 per
quarter.
For detailed information on alternatives for
determining depreciation amounts, see IRS
Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property,

Recording Fixed
Assets
Automating Depreciation
745
Only business assets need to be depreciated. No tax deduction is allowed for
depreciation of personal assets.
Automating Depreciation
Recording depreciation can get pretty tedious. After you calculate the amount,
the entries are the same, month after month, or quarter after quarter. Auto-
mating these entries is easy, so turn the task of recording depreciation over to
Quicken. Follow these steps to schedule an automatic entry of depreciation
expense:
1. Open the Asset register.
If you closed the register after entering your depreciation expense, press
Ctrl+A and double-click on the Asset register.
2. Open the Create Scheduled Transaction window.
Right-click on the depreciation transaction that you entered in the Asset
register, and then pick Schedule Transaction from the pop-up menu. The
Create Scheduled Transaction window appears (Figure 4-6). Many of the
fields have already been completed, using information from the register
transaction.
Figure 4-5:
Record a
depreciation

entry.

Automating Depreciation
746
3. Change the start date in the Start On field if necessary.
Quicken automatically entered the date one month after the date of your
depreciation transaction. If you’re going to enter depreciation monthly,
go ahead and keep that date. I’m going to enter depreciation quarterly,
so I’ve changed the date from April 30 to June 30.
Figure 4-6:
Let Quicken
enter your

expense for
you.
What’s this I hear about a Section 179 deduction?
The Section 179 deduction (named for the sec-
tion of the Internal Revenue Code that defines
the deduction) is the IRS’s way of letting you
deduct the full cost of your depreciable assets
in the year of acquisition, instead of trying to
figure out all the rules for calculating depreci-
ation costs. The amount of Section 179 depre-
ciation you can take has a limit, and this limit
seems to change depending on how generous
or stingy our Congressmen feel. For 2005, eligi-
ble taxpayers are allowed to deduct the full
purchase price of assets up to $105,000.
For 2006 and 2007, the annual Section 179
deduction limitation is supposed to increase
based on an adjustment for inflation. As of this
printing, the Section 179 deduction limitation is
scheduled to revert to $25,000 in 2008 with no
annual adjustment for inflation.
There are many rules and restrictions regarding
the use of Section 179, so it’s possible you or
your asset won’t qualify for the deduction. It’s
best to check with a tax advisor before choos-
ing to expense your assets. Take a look at the
“Whoa! Not so fast with that Section 179 deduc-
tion!” sidebar before you start adding up how
much of your asset costs you can deduct.

Book VIII
Chapter 4

747
4. Select automatic entry.
In the Scheduling area of the Create Scheduled Transaction window,
change the Remind Me choice to Automatically Enter. This way your
transaction can be entered by Quicken in your register without your
having to give any approval.
5. Choose how many days of advance notice you want to receive.
I don’t care to have advance notice of the depreciation transaction
because it’s not like I have to have money available to make a payment,
so I’ve set my days in advance field to zero days. However, you can enter
as many days notice as you want in this field.
Whoa! Not so fast with that 
Section 179 deduction!
You’ve probably heard the saying that a little
knowledge can be a dangerous thing. That
statement definitely applies to the Section 179
deduction, the tax deduction that allows you to
avoid calculating depreciation on fixed assets
and take an expense deduction for the entire
purchase price instead. I can’t say strongly
enough how important it is that you discuss the
depreciation treatment of your assets with 
a tax professional. Here are just a few rea-
sons why the Section 179 deduction might not
be for you:
 Some assets don’t qualify for the deduction.
For example, a home office must be depre-
ciated, not expensed. Heating and air con-
ditioning units and property used in rental
lodging, such as appliances or furniture,
don’t qualify for the deduction either.
 If you own property that qualified for a
Section 179 deduction at one time but is no
longer used more than 50 percent for busi-
ness (such as a vehicle used partly for
business and partly for personal purposes),
you are subject to recapture rules that
might require you to pay tax on some of the
Section 179 amount previously deducted.
 If you sell an asset prior to the end of the
asset’s recovery period and you took a
Section 179 deduction on that asset, you
might face an unfavorable tax treatment on
the profit from the sale of the asset.
 Depending on how much income your busi-
ness reports, you might not get a tax bene-
fit from claiming the Section 179 deduction.
 Even if your asset qualifies for the Section
179 deduction, if you expect to pay tax in a
higher tax bracket in the future, you might be
better off depreciating the asset and getting
a greater benefit from deducting the depre-
ciation in later years at a higher tax rate.
These are only some of the many considerations
to keep in mind when thinking about taking a
Section 179 deduction. Claiming the deduction is
not a slam-dunk by any means. Talk to a tax pro
and make sure you’re following the law and, at
the same time, giving yourself the best possible
tax treatment for your depreciable assets.

6. Choose the frequency you want Quicken to use for entering deprecia-
tion in your asset account.
I’ve selected Quarterly in the Frequency drop-down list for the frequency
of my depreciation entries.
7. Indicate last depreciation entry.
You need to let Quicken know when to stop entering depreciation
amounts in your register. Calculate how many total depreciation entries
there should be (five years of monthly entries would be 60 entries, five
years of quarterly entries would be 20 entries, and so on), subtract the
number of entries you’ve already made (one, if you’re setting up this
automation after making your first depreciation entry), and the remain-
der is the number you want to enter in the After xx Times field. I’ve
entered 19 in my schedule.
8. Complete the scheduled transaction.
Click OK to save the transaction and to put Quicken to work on entering
your depreciation.
Repeat these steps for each asset whose depreciation you want to 
automate.
Selling, Losing, Throwing Away, or Otherwise 
Getting Rid of Your Asset
Whether you keep your depreciable asset for the full term of the depreciation
period or remove it from the premises before the depreciation period is up, 
at some point, you probably are going to want to remove the asset from 
your active accounts so it no longer shows up on your financial statements.
Here are the alternatives for taking care of this task under a variety of 
circumstances.
✦You sell the asset. In the case of a sale, you need to remove the asset
from your accounts and also record the profit or loss on the sale. Say
you sell the sample computer for $200 after using it for one year. After
one year of depreciation at $50 per quarter, the computer value has
been reduced by $200 to a total of $800. In the bank account register
where you record the deposit for the money you received on the sale,
enter your deposit as a split transaction. As you can see in Figure 4-7,
I’ve entered the remaining value of the computer, $800, as a reduction in
the computer account, and I’ve entered the $600 loss on the sale in a cat-
egory called Loss from Sale of Asset. The net effect of subtracting the
$600 loss from the $800 remaining undepreciated cost is my $200

Chapter 4
Recording Fixed
Assets

749
deposit. In Figure 4-8, you can see that the computer’s register now dis-
plays a zero balance. If you sell the asset for a profit instead of a loss,
you still need to enter a transaction that reduces the asset balance to
zero. The additional category in the split transaction will be a profit cat-
egory instead of a loss category.

✦You stop using the asset. If the asset is no longer of use to you, and you
discard or otherwise retire the asset, you need to make an entry in the
Asset register itself, zeroing out the balance in the register and charging
the remaining amount to an expense category. In this case, if I stopped
using the asset after one year, I would charge the $800 remaining in the
Asset register to computer expense and cease quarterly depreciation.
If you remove an asset or stop using an asset before the depreciation period
is ended, be sure to change the rules of your scheduled transaction so that
no additional depreciation amounts are recorded.

P
lenty of visionaries foresee a world of offices completely devoid of paper.
Personally, I probably produce enough paper to fill a couple of dozen
offices all by myself. But that’s me, and I’m way behind the times when it
comes to saving and filing forms and reports electronically. Don’t let me 
be a bad example for you. The firms that walked away intact from the 2005
Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans are thanking their lucky stars
they had the foresight to use a variety of online and offsite storage tech-
niques for saving their data. Many companies returned to business in the
days after Katrina, in a new location, but without missing a record-keeping
beat. You’ll be happy too when you see how easy it is to create and keep
your documents with Quicken. Add a little creative back-up planning (see
Appendix A) and you can go paperless too!
Getting to Know Common Business Forms
Several forms are found in the typical business office. Although these forms
come in many different shapes and sizes and colors and scents (scents?),
the basic form types remain the same. Here is a rundown of the categories
into which most business forms fall:
✦Invoice: The mighty invoice is the form you send someone who owes
you money. We call the outgoing forms invoices and the incoming forms
bills just to keep track of which is which, but the terms are actually
interchangeable.
✦Statement: A statement is a reminder that you send to a customer that
hasn’t gotten around to paying your invoice yet. The statement can be a
copy of the original invoice with a friendly pay-up-or-else note attached,
or it can be a completely separate form. In particular, if your customer
hasn’t paid several different invoices, you can use the statement to 

Getting to Know Common Business Forms
752
summarize all of the outstanding invoices. Statements often act as little
invoices themselves because a business often tacks on a late payment
charge when they send a statement.
✦Estimate: Another breed of invoice, the estimate is like a demo invoice,
showing the customers what they can expect to see on an invoice if they
order your products or services. Customers aren’t expected to pay you
when you give them an estimate.
✦Bill: The bill is the flipside of an invoice, only this time, you’re on the
receiving end. Get a bill, and you can be sure someone across town is
tapping a toe, drumming fingers on a desk, or performing some other 
act of impatience while waiting to receive your moolah.
✦Order, or purchase order: Some companies like to have a formal record
of what they ordered. The order form or purchase order provides that
record, setting out exactly what the customer wants to buy.
✦Receipt for payment: For those companies that really like to generate
paperwork, there are the receipts, basically a thank-you note to the cus-
tomer who paid the bill. The receipt also serves as evidence that the 
bill has been paid, so if the seller inadvertently sends out a statement
demanding payment, the buyer can wave the receipt around, thumbing
his nose and chanting, “Na-na-na-na-na!”
✦Check stub: I’ll throw this one out here with the others, just because I
once worked in an office where we saved all of the check stubs from
each check we wrote. The stub would be attached to the bill that was
being paid, and then filed away in the proper file. (That was before we
had computers where we could easily look online to see which check
number was used to pay a bill.)
I’ll bet if you looked around your office at all the different types of paperwork
filling up your nooks and crannies, you could classify nearly every type of
paper into one of the above categories.
Standard forms available from Intuit
So where do all these forms come from? Somebody has to be in the business
of actually making forms so that all the other businesses have forms to send
to each other. It’s a vicious circle of some sort, no doubt conceived by some
alien culture that’s floating in space, just waiting for us to bury ourselves
alive in an insurmountable heap of paperwork.
Many office forms have gone purely electronic. For example, every time I
order a book online, for example, I see a screen showing me what the book is
going to cost (bill), and after I dispatch my payment, I receive an e-mail mes-
sage thanking me for my order (receipt). But forms of the paper variety are
still the standard for many businesses. If you need to produce paper forms,

Book VIII
Chapter 5
Business Forms 
and Reports
Getting to Know Common Business Forms
753
you have a few choices. You can create your own paper forms, you can create
forms right in Quicken or in other programs that you might own, or you can
purchase preprinted forms.
If you want duplicate copies of your forms, the preprinted forms are probably
your best bet — they come with duplicates built in. Or you can sit at your
computer all day, pressing Ctrl+P to print the same forms over and over again.
You don’t have to go far from the mothership to get standard, preprinted
forms for use in your office and for use with your Quicken program. Take a
quick trip to the Internet, as I demonstrate in the steps below, and you’ll see
what I mean:
1. Open the Quicken home page, at www.quicken.com.
2. Click the Products & Services button at the top of the Quicken home
page.
3. Open the Checks & Supplies page.
On the left side of the Products & Services page, in the Other Quicken
Products section (Figure 5-1), click Quicken Checks & Supplies. Choose
from a variety of products (Figure 5-2) offered by the kind folks at
Quicken/Intuit.

Other sources for forms
Quicken’s online store isn’t the only option for preprinted forms. Have you
ever been to an office supply store? All of the office stores offer their own
version of these products, and there are plenty of online office supply out-
lets as well. Search to your heart’s content, compare prices and styles, and
pick the forms you want.
If your business needs a special type of form, and if you use enough of the
forms to justify the cost, don’t overlook the idea of designing your own
forms and have them printed for you at a print shop.
Using the spreadsheet and word processor
You can design your own forms from scratch using the expertise you pos-
sess in your favorite spreadsheet and word processing programs. And if you
poke around a bit, you might discover some ready-made form templates
lurking in those programs, ready for you to use.
For example, take a look at Figure 5-3. I found this invoice template in my
Excel program by choosing File➪New from the menu and clicking the
Spreadsheet Solutions tab in the window that appeared. Other standard

forms are available in Excel, and other programs offer similar model forms
that you can put to use in your business.
Customizing forms in Quicken
As I discuss in Chapter 2 of this book, you can create invoices and other
forms right in your Quicken program. If you don’t like what you see onscreen,
change it! It’s not hard to take an existing Quicken form and customize the
layout and the fields that appear on the form so that the form is more useful
for your business. Here’s an example of how you can create your own form
right in Quicken:
1. Display the Business Center.
Click the Business Center heading in the Account Bar at the left side 
of the screen. Make sure the Analysis & Reports tab is selected in the
Business Center.
2. On the right side of the Business Center window, in the Tools area,
click the Forms Designer link (Figure 5-4) to open the Forms Designer.
The Forms Designer window appears, with an Invoice form displayed.
3. Choose the form you want to design.
Figure 5-3:
Look what 
I found in
Excel!

Getting to Know Common Business Forms
756
Quicken offers you a choice of three forms that you can futz with: the
Invoice form, the Estimate form, and the Credit form. You can create
your own personalized, customized, systematic, hydromatic, greased-
lightning form from scratch with the Forms Designer. Pick the form you
want to redesign by clicking the Layout menu at the top of the Forms
Designer. Choose New from the menu and the Create New Layout window
appears (Figure 5-5). Click the Select a Layout Type drop-down menu to
display your choices, and then choose from Invoice, Estimate, or Credit.
I’ve picked Invoice to use for this example.
4. Give your new form a name.
With the Create New Layout window still open, enter a name for this form
in the Enter a New Layout Name field. If you need a variety of forms to
use for different types of transactions, be sure to give this form a name
that distinguishes it from the other forms you plan to create.
5. Choose Portrait or Landscape.
Do you like your forms sideways? You can have the form tall (portrait)
or wide (landscape) — make your choice. Then click OK and you’re
ready to begin designing.
6. Choose the fields that should appear on your form.
On the left side of the Forms Designer, you see a list of all of the fields that
are eligible to appear on the form. If you look closely at the list, you can
see that each item that actually appears on the form is checked off in the
little check box that appears next to the name of the field (see Figure 5-6).
Your first order of business is to decide which fields you want to have on
your customized form. Uncheck any fields you want to remove; leave
checkmarks in the fields that should stay.
Figure 5-5:
Pick which
form you
want to use
as your

point.
Figure 5-4:
Click over to
the Forms
Designer.

Book VIII
Chapter 5
Business Forms 
and Reports
Getting to Know Common Business Forms
757
Some fields are required, and Quicken won’t let you remove those fields
in the Forms Designer. For example, on the Invoice form, you have to
have a bill to address, a date, an invoice number, a description, and an
amount. Quicken has dimmed the check boxes for these fields so you
can’t remove them. But you find out how you can get around this sticky
rule in step 7.
7. Change the names of fields!
Ha! So what if you can’t take away the invoice number field? If you don’t
use invoice numbers, you can change the name of the field as it appears
on the form, so that the field is called something more appropriate to your
business. In this example, you make some changes to the actual fields that
appear on this invoice. For this example, I’m going to create an invoice for
an accountant who offers tax preparation services. First, instead of calling
this form Invoice, I’m going to change the title that appears on the form to
Tax Preparation Services. Click the Properties double-arrow that appears
to the right of the Title field over in the left column, and a window called
Title of Layout appears (Figure 5-7). Replace Invoice with Tax Preparation
Services and click OK. The new title appears in place of the word Invoice
on the form. Using the same technique, I’m also going to replace the name
of the Number field with Tax Return Year. Finally, I’m going to keep the field
for Bill To, but completely remove the name by just leaving the name field
blank.
Figure 5-6:

758
8. Resize the field.
Uh-oh. I changed the name of the title to Tax Preparation Services but it
appears that that title doesn’t fit on my form (Figure 5-8). That problem
can be remedied by changing the size of the field. Click on the form, right
on the field you want to resize, and a blue outline appears around that
field. Place your mouse pointer on the edge of the outline and drag to
stretch or shrink the field. After I resized my Title field, the entire title fits
(Figure 5-9).

9. Move the field by dragging.
You can drag fields around on the report if you want to place them in a dif-
ferent location. For example, I’m going to drag my title over so it appears
in the center of the form instead of on the right side. Click any field to drag
it to a new location. If you want to align the field with another field that
appears on the report, use the Align option on the Item menu. The next
step shows how Align works.
10. Resize the field based on an existing field.
You can drag a field to get to the size you want, or you can let Quicken
resize the field to match an existing field so that you make sure you get
exactly the size you want. I want my Date field to be exactly the same
size as my Number field (which I renamed to Tax Return Year, using the
method in step 7). So I click on the field I want to resize (the Date field)
and choose Item➪Size Item. When the Size Layout Item window appears,
I click the Number field (still called Number, as you can see on the list 
at the left, even though I’ve changed the heading of the field to Tax
Return Year) because that’s the field I want to match to. I want both the
height and the width of the fields to be identical, so I pick Both in the
Size Settings (Figure 5-9), and then click OK. My two fields are now of
identical size.
11. Align one field with another.
For a precise placement of a field and a more professional look, you can
align one field with another. Click on the field you want to align, and then
choose Item➪Align Item from the menu to open the Align Layout Item
window. In Figure 5-10, you can see that I’ve moved my Date field beneath
the Number field. I want the right and left edges of these two fields to
line up with one another. I click on the Date field, and then choose Align
Item from the Item menu. In the window that appears, I choose Right
Border and Right Border for the two sides I want to match up, making
sure that Number is selected as the field to align with in the drop-down
list provided. I’ve already sized these two fields so they are the same
Figure 5-9:
Resize fields

precision
using the

Item
window.

Getting to Know Common Business Forms
760
size, so I only have to line up one edge for them to be aligned on both
sides. The final result is that the right and left margins of the two fields
are in precise alignment with one another.
12. If you decide you’re not content with dragging my title to the center of
the form and eyeballing it, you can ensure that the title is exactly in
the center of the form.
I click on the Title field, and then choose Position from the Item menu. In
the Position Item in Page window that appears (Figure 5-11), I choose
Horiz. Center and click OK. The title moves to the dead center between
the two horizontal margins.
13. Make other changes until you’re satisfied with the layout of the form.
Continue working with the form until you get it just the way you want it
to look. For my form, I did away with the Item, Ship To Address, P.O.
Number, Quantity, Rate, and Sales Tax fields.
14. Change type styles.
You can customize the font choice on your forms as well. I think the
form title is too stark, so I’m going to change the font to something more
soothing. Click the double arrow next to the Set Fonts option on the left
Figure 5-11:
Position a

side of the Forms Designer. The Set Layout Fonts window appears
(Figure 5-12). From the Select Layout Font to Set drop-down list, pick the
item for which you want to change a font. You can change the font for
any or all of the items on list, but only one item can be changed at a
time. I’ve chosen Title Text Font for my first change.
15. Open the Fonts window.
Having selected the area of the form that needs a new font, click the Set
Font button and the Font window appears. Choose the font, the style,
and the size you want to use, and then click OK. Your change is incorpo-
rated into the report.
Changing the size of the fonts can cause some fields to move around a
bit. You might have to relocate some of the fields after you’re finished
changing the fonts.
16. Enter company information.
You can enter your company name and address, and you can also place
a logo on the form if you have one. Click the Logo option on the left side
of the designer window to open the Print Logo dialog box to print your
company name or click the Browse button to upload the file containing
your logo.
Click the Company Address option on the left side of the designer window
to open a field on the form window where you can enter your company
name and address. Then you can use the Font option as described in
step 14 above to change the font for your company address information
if you like.
17. Save your finished form.
All that work — don’t forget to save! Take a look at your finished project
and pat yourself on the back (you can see my finished project in Fig-
ure 5-13). Then, click the Layout menu at the top of the Forms Designer
window and choose Save. The form is saved using the name you entered
way back in step 4. (Actually, it appears that Quicken automatically
saves the form, but the Save option appears on the menu, so just for
good measure, it makes sense to use this option. It can’t hurt . . . .)

18. Click the X in the upper-right corner to close the designer window.
Rather than starting all over again, if you want to design another form
that is similar to the one you just finished, click the Layout menu and
choose Copy while your new form is still on display. You’ll be asked to
give the copy a name. Now you have two customized forms of the same
type, and you can start designing a new form with all of the features of
your other customized form.
Creating Business Reports in Quicken
Reports are a necessary part of running a business. You have to know how
your business is doing, whether you’re making money, how much your cus-
tomers owe you, how much you owe, where your money comes from and
where it goes, and so on. Many of the reports you need are standard in
Quicken and have been covered in Book VII. But a few reports are unique to
the Home & Business version of Quicken, and you should be familiar with
them. Choose Reports➪Business from your Quicken menu, or open the
Reports & Graphs Center and click on Business. You’ll see the business
reports that Quicken considers to be standard (see Figure 5-14).

Click on a report name, and you’ll immediately see a little notice if the report
is available only in Home & Business. Only a few reports are available only in
Home & Business, and of those, some are available with a different name in
other versions of Quicken.
Herewith, a quick rundown of some of the more important business reports
you’ll find only in Home & Business:
✦Payroll: The payroll report shows a list of all your payroll accounts and
categories, both income and expense, along with a separate column for
each of your employees. If you recall, in Chapter 4 of this book, I set up
some payroll accounts and categories. I was careful to place the word
Payroll in the name of each account or category. Quicken seeks out
these accounts and categories containing the word Payroll, and that is
what is assembled on the payroll report.
✦Profit and loss statement and profit and loss comparison: Much like
their cousins, the income and expense reports, the P&L reports show
your income, your expenses, and the difference between the two. The
P&L comparison report lets you specify two different periods of time to
compare performance. For example, you might want to know how you
did during the same quarter last year and this year. The P&L comparison
report tells you. Notice that the P&L reports in the Business section of
the Reports & Graphs list indicate they are only available in Home &
Business. However, there are income and expense comparison and cash
flow comparison reports available in other versions of Quicken. These
reports can get you to information like the business P&L reports.
Figure 5-14:
These are
the standard
business
reports 
that come
with your
Quicken
program.

✦Project/job reports: These reports are unique to Home & Business. They
display the income and expenses for your projects, grouped by project
or class. You don’t have access to projects in non-Home & Business ver-
sions of Quicken, but you do have access to classes, and you can create
a report pretty similar to the project/job reports by organizing your
reports by classes.
✦Schedule C report: The Schedule C report in Home & Business summa-
rizes the Schedule C business income and expenses according to the
Schedule C tax lines. If you don’t have Home & Business, you can do
what I’ve done. I’ve set up a Quicken file where I use Schedule C Income
and Schedule C Expense as top-level categories, and then all of the
Schedule C transactions are entered into subcategories under these two
top-level categories. It’s easy to then customize a report to show just the
transactions in the Schedule C categories, and this can be done in any
version of Quicken.
The bottom line on business reports is that, although certain reports are set
up for you in Quicken Home & Business and are extremely handy, you can
get the information you need out of any version of Quicken by choosing and
customizing the reports that display transactions from the categories you
want to analyze.
Whenever you customize a business report that you find is useful, take the
extra time to memorize the report so that you can access the report again in
the future without having to re-create the report from scratch.
Quicken’s standard reports appear on the left side of the Reports & Graphs
window. Over on the right side of the window is the list of reports you have
created and saved. If you’re frantically searching for a report you customized
in the past, check out the list on the right side of the Reports & Graphs
window.

Appendix A: Backing Up Data
In This Appendix
 Why backing up files is important
 Backing up to disks and other hard devices
 Backing up online
 Restoring data
I
t’s not enough that people today create megabytes and gigabytes and
tyrannosaurusobytes of data on a daily basis . . . have you every stopped
to think about where all these bytes go? Just because we can’t see them 
doesn’t mean they aren’t there, filling the space around us. When we walk
down the street, are we heedlessly parting a sea of bytes, just as easily as we
move through the air? What if these bytes were visible? Would the pavement
be thick with them? Would they pile up on corners like trash in Manhattan?
And now we find out we’re supposed to back up everything we do, effectively
doubling the number of bytes around us. Mark my words. It won’t be long
before the bytes get organized and start asking for weekends and holidays off.
If you’ve never lost computer data you either (a) don’t use a computer, or
(b) are the next candidate for the Big Crash. Because I know you must use a
computer or else have really strange reading habits, my guess is you fit the
bill for the big crash. Everybody loses data, sometimes without even trying.
Just ask the people who lived in New Orleans in the fall of 2005 who left
their computers behind when they fled the flooding city.
The question you need to ask yourself when entering information on your
computer is, “Do I want to have to enter all of this information again if some-
thing bad happens to my computer?”
If the answer is, “Sure, why not? I’ve got nothing better to do with my time,”
you can skip right over this appendix. If the answer is something more along
the lines of, “You’ve got to be kidding!,” it’s time to get started discussing
options for backing up your data.

Where Should I Back Up?
BC2
Where Should I Back Up?
You can choose to back up your data in a number of different locations. For
example,
✦Back up to a different file on your own computer. This system doesn’t
give you much protection if your computer crashes, but it’s better than
nothing. If for some reason your main data file gets corrupted, you at
least have a backup handy, and easy to access.
✦Back up to your network server. This takes you a level above the first
option — if your computer crashes, the server still has your data. If your
entire network crashes, you’re out of luck.
✦Back up to an external disk, tape, CD-ROM, or hard drive. There are
plenty of options when it comes to backing up material on external
media. Initially, your Quicken data file is small enough that you can back
it up onto a floppy disk. As the file grows, the disk needs to be swapped
for a larger variety, such as a Zip disk, tape, CD-ROM, or an external hard
drive. Now that you’ve moved your backed-up data off of the computer
and the server in your office, you can consider off-site storage of the
data. The farther away you move the backup, the safer the data is in the
event of a natural disaster. On the other hand, the farther away the data,
the harder it might be to get access to it if you need a quick restoration.
These are the issues you must consider when deciding where to store
your data.
✦Back up online. Quicken offers an online back-up service that is easily
available right from your Quicken program.
Quicken isn’t the only game in town when in comes to online data backup.
There are plenty of secure Internet services that provide a home-away-from-
home for your data. Search and ye shall find.
Performing the Backup
After you’ve decided where to back up your data, it’s time to figure out how
the back-up system works. First, decide how you’re going to back up and
where you’re going to store the data. When you’re ready to begin, choose
either the external or the online back-up process and get busy making little
backups.
Backing up data to an external, non-online location
Start by getting the back-up device and storage media ready, so that when
you begin this procedure, you won’t have to stop to fumble around looking
for the back-up disk or CD.

Book IX
Appendix A
Backing Up Data
Performing the Backup
BC3
1. Open the Backup window by choosing File➪Backup from the menu,
or pressing Ctrl+B.
In the Quicken Backup window that appears (Figure A-1), you are asked
what you want to back up and where you want to put it.
2. Identify the Quicken data file to be backed up.
This is a no-brainer because Quicken knows where its files are located and
has already picked out the file that needs to be backed up. If there is actu-
ally a different Quicken data file that you want to back up, the smart thing
to do is close this Backup window, open the correct data file in Quicken,
and return to step 1. As long as the data file that needs to be backed up is
open, Quicken presents the correct filename in the Backup window.
3. Check the Add the Date to File Name check box.
This helps you keep track of which back-up file is which, and it can’t
hurt, so I suggest you go ahead and check the box.
4. Tell Quicken where to put the file: on your computer or online.
I’m going to skip the online option for a sec and concentrate on computer
backups. Backing up to your computer doesn’t necessarily mean placing
the back-up file right on your computer (although it can mean this if you
like). Basically, it means backing up to a drive accessible by your com-
puter, and this can include all the options of drives, including a tape drive,
Zip disk, DVD, CD-ROM, external USB drive, and so on. Just identify the
drive letter and, if necessary, the folder where the back-up file is to be
Figure A-1:

placed. Oh, and just to be safe, keep track of where you put your back-up
file so you can find it again in case you need to restore your data.
Windows XP users have an extra bonus. You’ll see a little check box that
enables you to use a CD writing wizard if you want to use special CD
writing software to store your data on a CD.
5. Click OK to actually perform the backup.
Change your mind? Click Cancel instead and back up later. A little window
appears when the back-up process is complete, telling you everything
went smoothly and your extra copy of your data is safe and sound. Click
OK to close the window.
6. Perform the most important step.
And you thought you were finished! Not so fast. Take your back-up disk
or whatever media you used to store the backed-up data, and place the
data somewhere secure. Now you can rest easy.
Backing up data online
Online data backup enables you to keep a copy of your data safe and readily
available without having to bother with disks and tapes and extra drives.
Note, however, that there is a fee associated with most online back-up serv-
ice providers, including Quicken’s service. The process described below is
for use with the Quicken online service. If you are using another service, you
need to find out their instructions. The back-up process likely differs slightly.
If you are using Quicken’s online back-up service for the first time, go ahead
and get yourself signed up for the service before beginning the back-up
process. When you’re all signed up, come back and get started.
1. Open the Backup window.
Just like in the previous steps, choose File➪Backup from the menu, or
press Ctrl+B and the Quicken Backup window appears.
2. See step 2 in the previous section for information about making sure
you’re backing up the right file.
3. Click the Online back-up option.
4. Click OK.
Quicken takes over and the backup is completed.
Quicken offers a free 30-day trial for the online back-up service. If you
haven’t signed up for Quicken’s online backup and want to give it a try, com-
plete steps 1-4 above and you are taken right to the screen where you can
sign up for the free trial.

If you are a subscriber to Quicken’s online back-up service, a Settings button
magically appears in your Quicken Backup window. Clicking this settings
button gives you the option of scheduling automatic backups to the Quicken
online back-up service. Just say the word and Quicken can automatically
drop by, backing up and making sure your data is safe without your having
to remember to do the back-up thing yourself.
Bring Back, Bring Back, Bring Back My Data to Me
Backing up your Quicken data file is only half the fun. Losing the data from
your computer begins the other half of the fun, the part when you have to go
get your backed up data and put it back on your computer. You’ll be glad
you backed-up daily or weekly instead of once a year when you have to
restore data. As with so many tasks in Quicken, restoration is quick and
easy. Just take a look.
Restoring from disks, CDs, and other such places
If you backed up your data to a disk or some other media, here are the steps
to follow for restoration. P.S.: I’m sorry you’re having this difficulty. You’re
probably not in a very good mood if you are dealing with a crashed or
destroyed computer or a system that just won’t cooperate with you. Sit
back, have some milk and cookies, and let Quicken bring at least this part of
your life back to normal.
1. Reinstall Quicken if necessary, and then choose File➪Restore Backup
File from the menu.
There is a side menu attached to the Restore Backup File menu choice. 
If Quicken knows where your data file is lurking, that filename and its
location is listed on the side menu. If that file information is incorrect, or
if there is a different data file you need to restore, choose Browse from
the side menu. It might be the case that the Browse side menu is your
only choice.
2. Indicate the location of your back-up file.
When the Restore Quicken File appears (Figure A-2), indicate the appro-
priate drive, folder, and file that you need to restore. When all of the
information is correct, click the OK button to continue.
3. Give Quicken the go-ahead.
If a data file is already present on your system, your restoration is going
to replace that file. You have to click OK in the box shown in Figure A-3
to continue with the restore process.

Bring Back, Bring Back, Bring Back My Data to Me

4. Open your restored data file.
Quicken lets you know when the restoration is complete. Click OK in the
box shown in Figure A-4, and then click File➪Open from the menu to
gain access to your restored file.

exactly where your data is hiding. The restore process for online data doesn’t
go through the File menu in Quicken like the standard restore does. Instead,
open the Quicken Online Backup program from your computer’s Start menu.
When the online back-up program opens, click the Retrieve View tab, and
then click the Retrieve Options button. Answer the questions to identify
what you need to restore, and you are taken to a screen where you can find
your files and begin the restoration process.
Because your back-up data files are stored online, you don’t have to worry
about loss of data should your computer be damaged. You can install
Quicken on a different computer and restore your online data to the new
computer.

I
suppose there are reasons why our computer programs don’t always do
the things we want them to. For example, why would you ever buy a new
program if the program you already have can take care of all of your com-
puting issues? I could digress about how every time a new program comes
out, the software company tells us that this new model will do everything
we need, until next year when the next new model comes out. Do our needs
change that much each year? But I won’t go off in that direction, no sir. 
I’ll just say that it’s probably really hard for computer programs to please
everyone, so the things that aggravate me about Quicken might not bother
you at all, and you might have your own completely different set of features
you don’t like about your Quicken program. No matter. Just wait a year and
another new model will be out, guaranteed to tick off somebody.
Closing Windows Is Trickier Than It Should Be
As a QuickBooks user, I’ve gotten really used to being able to close any
window on my QuickBooks screen by simply pressing Esc. With Quicken,
closing windows isn’t quite so easy.
Alt+F4 always works to close a window in Quicken, so I guess that’s good 
to know. The problem is that sometimes I’ve used Alt+F4 to close a report,
and the whole Quicken program closes too. Open a little window like Edit
Category, and Esc closes that window, leaving the program open.
You can always rely on the little X in the upper-right corner. That closes any
window, but it also involves clicking, which sometimes I’d rather not do.
When I’ve been having a bad mouse day, I’d just as soon use the keyboard to
get the job done. And that brings me to my next aggravating feature.

Many Quicken Buttons Have No Keyboard Equivalent
BC10
Many Quicken Buttons Have No Keyboard Equivalent
Maybe I’m just hung up on using the keyboard with my Quicken program, but 
I think some people are just keyboard people and other people are mouse
people. Maybe it’s because I learned to type long before computers even
existed (my graduation present from 8th grade was a non-electric typewriter,
and believe me, it was a big deal). Or maybe it’s just because I spend so much
time at the keyboard and I’m basically lazy and don’t want to have to reach
for the mouse when my fingers are already on the keys. Or maybe it’s that I
wish they had come up with a name other than mouse for the little clicker
thing — it just sounds so childish . . .
But back to the point. If you open any one of the Centers in Quicken — try
the Cash Flow Center, for example (see Figure B-1) — just look at all those
buttons! You’ve got buttons for adding accounts and editing accounts and
showing the calendar, and all sorts of other tasks, but none of them are
within reach of my fingers on the keyboard.
I know, I can use keyboard shortcuts to get to the menus, but that takes
extra steps. So it looks like I have to get friendly with that little clicker thing
if I’m going to use Quicken.

Savings Goals Shouldn’t Change the Balance in Your Bank Account BC11
Savings Goals Shouldn’t Change the 
Balance in Your Bank Account
The whole concept of savings goals is interesting, but it’s a little confusing
when you use a savings goal and look at your bank account balance — it
looks like you have a lot less money in the bank than you actually do.
I like the Savings Goal feature — it’s an easy way to keep track of how long
before I can afford to take that Caribbean vacation I’m dreaming of. However,
I’m not sure I like having the balance in my account altered to accommodate
the amount I’ve allocated for the savings goal (see Figure B-2).
If I don’t remember that I’ve got so much money put away for the trip, I might
panic when my car breaks down and I really need some emergency cash to
do the repairs. There has to be a better way to keep track of savings goals
without actually changing the display of the bank account balance.
Figure B-2:

Changing Categories to Subcategories Is Too Difficult
BC12
Changing Categories to Subcategories Is Too Difficult
Changing the hierarchy of categories is annoyingly difficult in Quicken. If
you’re familiar with QuickBooks, you know that in that program, you just
open the Account List or the Vendor List or whatever list, (like a Category
List), and slide the item right and left to move to a new level of hierarchy, or
up and down to move to a new parent.
In Quicken, if you want to change the subcategory status of a category, you
have to open the Category List, find the category, and click Edit. Moving to a
lower level of subcategory is easy. Moving up to a top-level category is not
impossible, but just not quite as intuitive. You have to select Income or
Expense as the category type, and then the subcategory goes away.
I know I was complaining about having to use the mouse earlier, but some-
times a little click and drag is just what the doctor ordered.
Undoing Custom Forms Is a Pain
If you took my advice in Book VIII and started customizing your business
forms, it’s quite possible that you got carried away with font experimenta-
tion. Don’t be ashamed — it happens to the best of us. You see a font that
looks really cool in the sample screen, and then you plaster it all over your
company invoice form and suddenly you realize you just aren’t cut out to be
a form designer (see Figure B-3).
But wait! What was that font that was there before you started down the
path of form redesign? I’ll bet you’ve forgotten. And now you have to experi-
ment with more fonts in what is bound to be a futile attempt to make the
form look like it did before you got creative.
Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a little Font Reset button so you could just
click Fonts, and then click Reset to send all the weirdo fonts scurrying back
into their holes? No such luck. But before you waste any more time trying 
to figure out how the fonts used to look, and before you give up and decide
to trash the form you worked so hard to design, here’s a list of the original
Quicken form font selections. You can click the Set Fonts button on the left
side of the Forms Designer, and then use these settings in the Set Layout
Fonts dialog box (Figure B-4) to bring sanity back to your customized form.

t stands to reason that amongst all the millions of sources for pornographic
pictures and libido-enhancing drugs available on the Internet today, there
ought to be a page or two of useful information for people who want to find
out more about their personal finances. I’ve actually gathered a regular festival
of pages of fun financial facts that you can explore the next time you find your-
self poking around online.
Internal Revenue Service
I’ve decided to begin with our friends at the Internal Revenue Service because
they’ve gone out of their way to make their Web site at www.irs.gov a fun
and inviting place for everyone who wants (or, for that matter, who doesn’t
want) to pay their taxes. Not only can you find enough tax forms and tax pub-
lications to paper the walls of every room in your house, you can actually file
income tax returns, make tax payments online, check up on the whereabouts
of your refund, and send e-mail messages to your favorite revenue agent. Just
take a look at all the IRS has to offer.
Use Free File and file your tax return online
Who needs a paper tax return when you can file online for free? If you’re
ready to try this experience, go to the home page of the IRS Web site, and
click the e-file logo (Figure C-1). On the page that appears, click the Free File
hyperlink to be taken to another page where you can answer a few questions
and then find links to tax services that will prepare your federal tax return
for free.

Internal Revenue Service
BC16
Certain requirements have to apply in order for the free tax preparation
service to kick in — I doubt Bill Gates qualifies for free tax filing, but most of
the rest of us do.
Pay your taxes online
It’s nearly midnight on April 15th and you haven’t paid your taxes yet? You
say you have to pay estimated taxes each quarter, and you’re coming up on
the deadline? You can take care of this pesky chore right at the IRS Web site.
Back on the home page of the IRS Web site (Figure C-1), click the EFTPS link
to get over to the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. Here you can read
about all of your choices for online payment, including credit card payment
and automatic withdrawal of funds from your bank account.
There is a fee for paying taxes by credit card. Not only do you run up finance
charges on your credit card if you carry the balance over a period of time,
but you are charged for the online tax payment service as well. Be sure to
read the fine print before you sign, or, in this case, click, on the dotted line.

Electronic payment options on the IRS Web site are available 24/7 — this is
great for those last minute filers (you know who you are). Instead of scurry-
ing off to the post office at midnight and trying to get that postmark before
the deadline, stay home, stay warm, and pay online.
Check up on your refund
If you take a look at the IRS home page (Figure C-1), you see a link to Where’s
My Refund? Follow this link to a page where you can enter your Social
Security number and the amount of the tax refund you are expecting, and
the IRS gives you the status of the refund.
If the refund is in the mail or scheduled to be mailed or direct deposited, you
find out when you can expect to receive the money. If there is a problem with
processing your refund, you receive a phone number you can call to speak
with a real IRS person who can help you clear up the problem.
Social Security Administration
Head on over to the Social Security Administration’s Web site, at www.ssa.
gov, and you can read everything you ever wanted to know about your
Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Here are a few of the things you can do during your visit with the SSA:
✦Click the Your Social Security Statement link on the right side of the
home page (Figure C-2) to find out what information is contained in
your statement and to request a copy of your Social Security statement.
The statement itself cannot be accessed online for security reasons, but
information about how to request the statement both by mail and online
is available to you.
✦Apply for benefits. If you think you qualify to receive retirement or dis-
ability payments, click Apply for Retirement Benefits or Apply for
Disability Benefits on the home page to fill out an online application to
request your benefits.
✦Change your name. No, don’t just arbitrarily change your name — the
government frowns on this. But if you legally change your name (for
example, through a court proceeding or change in marital status), you
have to report that information to the Social Security Administration
and get yourself a shiny new Social Security card. Click Marriage,
Divorce, and Name Changes on the home page to take care of this 
housework.

o matter how hard those guys at Intuit try to come up with a foolproof
program that does exactly what everyone wants it to and is completely,
dare I say it, intuitive, somebody out there is always asking questions. “How
fast does she go on the open road?” “Can I take a look under the hood?” “Does
the short wheel base handle well on hills?” Oh wait. I’m in the wrong help
room. Anyway, here are some methods for getting under the hood of the
Quicken issues that drive you crazy . . .
Use the Resource Right in Your Hand

You’re not the first person to have questions about Quicken. And if you know
anyone who uses the program, there’s a good chance that person has run
into problems similar to the ones you are facing. Ask around to see if any of
your friends or relatives use Quicken and are available to help you through
some stumbling blocks. Sometimes all you need is a familiar voice telling you
everything is going to work out just the way you want it to.
