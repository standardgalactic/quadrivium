Author’s Acknowledgments
Above all else, I thank God for giving me the ability to string two sentences 
together coherently (sometimes). Because I only reach my full potential 
sometimes, I thank the team at Wiley that helped make this book what you 
expect it to be. Paul, Jen, Paul Chaney (acting as tech editor), and all the 
people in production that put in as much time as I have — thank you. Your 
input is more valuable than I could ever express.
A huge thank you also goes out to Steve Olechowski over at Google. Steve, 
your last-minute save made you nothing short of a superhero in my book. 
Thanks so much.
My biggest thanks go out to you, the reader. Thanks for reading this book. I 
hope it helps you realize all the potential of AdSense.

Introduction
T
he Web is big business, and you probably picked up Google AdSense For 
Dummies hoping to tap into some of the money that’s available online. 
Good choice. I wrote this book to help you to make more money online.
I’m not talking the get rich scheme of the decade, though. AdSense is serious 
business and requires serious effort. This book is designed to give you an 
understanding of AdSense and how to make the most money possible using 
it with your particular Web site. Not everyone is destined to be an AdSense 
millionaire, but using the principles I lay out in the pages that follow should 
help you at least add enough money to your budget to enjoy a nice dinner 
out now and again.
About This Book
Google AdSense For Dummies is an introduction to Google AdSense and how 
to use it to add a revenue stream to your Web site or blog. I explain every-
thing you need to know in order to get started with AdSense, from signing up 
for the program to creating various types of ads, including ads for content, 
mobile Web sites, and video ads. The book includes dozens of tips to help 
you get up to speed with AdSense faster than you can down your allotment 
of caffeine.
If you know nothing at all about AdSense, this book is the user’s guide that 
you won’t find in the online AdSense Help pages. If you’re already somewhat 
familiar with AdSense, you can depend on this book to show you how to 
optimize your AdSense efforts and start making money with your ads.
Conventions Used in This Book
The alphabet soup that accompanies anything technology is enough to make 
you gouge out your eyeballs in an attempt to massage your aching brain. I 
avoid as many of those acronyms as possible. I even try to keep the jargon 
that’s always associated with technology to a minimum.
As with all specific technologies, however, some level of geek-speak is 
involved. If I absolutely have to use techno-mumbo-jumbo to make a point, I 
add a clear explanation along with the offensive words, just so you’re clear 
on what you’re reading.

2
Google AdSense For Dummies 
Also, I’m a geek, and I have a geek’s sense of humor. Still, I lighten up the 
seriousness of the topics covered where I can. Keep in mind though, it’s still 
technology, and you’ll still find that some parts are as exciting as sorting 
paperclips. Like I said, I’m a geek.
Foolish Assumptions
My dad used to remind me often that the results of making assumptions were 
often not pretty. Still, I had to make some assumptions about you, the reader, 
and your understanding of technology. Those assumptions are
 
 You have a Web site or blog that you want to earn money from.
 
 You’re familiar with how that Web site or blog works.
 
 You have a basic understanding of technologies associated with making 
your Web site or blog work.
 
 You have a desire to make more money with your Web site.
 
 You want to make more money with AdSense.
How This Book Is Organized
Every software program has a structure and a progression. AdSense is one 
of those programs, and I designed this book to follow that natural structure 
as closely as possible. The book is broken into parts, and each one covers 
a different aspect of AdSense. The chapters within each part cover different 
details of each aspect.
Chapters are designed to stand on their own, so you have two options: You 
can read the book straight through, or thumb through and read the chapters 
that are most appealing to you. Here’s more information on what you’ll find 
in the sections of the book.
Part I: AdSense Basics
This first part gets you up to speed with all the information that you need to 
know, even before you begin using AdSense. If you’re going to use an adver-
tising program, you need to have something to use it on, so most of the chap-
ters in this section cover creating and preparing your Web site for AdSense. 
Of course, I provide a detailed explanation of what AdSense is, too.

 Introduction
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense 
for Content, AdSense for Search
The way the AdSense program is broken down, you have separate mini-
applications within the main application. In this part of the book, I cover two 
of those mini-applications: AdSense for Content and AdSense for Search.
The first chapters here have everything you need to know when it comes to 
building ads for your content. (Just to be on the safe side, I also fill you in 
on how to get great content on your Web site in the first place!) I then go on 
to tell you how you can use AdSense for Search to make money. (Here’s the 
shorthand version — you place access to search engines on your Web site 
and get paid when users search and then click the ads that are displayed in 
search results.)
Part III: Other Types of AdSense
AdSense isn’t just about placing ads in your text content. You can monetize 
your Web site in many other ways, and this section details the different capa-
bilities that AdSense gives you. From placing video ads, to placing ads in your 
video (they really are two different things), to placing ads on mobile Web 
sites, you find the information you need in this part.
Part IV: AdSense Administration
No software program or application works without some tweaking from you. 
If you want to know how to tweak AdSense to get the best performance pos-
sible or where to find information on how well your ads are performing and 
how much money you’re making, you can do so in the Administration section 
of the application. In this part, I show you how to tweak AdSense and how to 
make the most out of the administrative tools that are available to you.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this section of the book, you find quick lists to help you use AdSense 
better. Check out ten (plus two) tools that you have to have if you want to 
take full advantage of AdSense, ten things you should never ever ever do 
with AdSense, and ten ways to improve your Web site traffic (because it’s all 
about exposing your ads to more people, right?).

Google AdSense For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
This For Dummies book is formatted just like the other ten gazillion out 
there, so you’ll find icons in the margins to help you identify information you 
should pay special attention to. The icons used throughout this book are:
 
I use the Tip icon to alert you to shortcuts and other tidbits of information 
that you might find useful when you’re using AdSense and the other programs 
that I discuss.
 
The Warning icon alerts you to use caution when performing tasks or follow-
ing a set of instructions. The icon indicates information that can cause prob-
lems with software or hardware if you’re not careful about how you proceed.
 
Okay, this is the really geeky stuff. Read on if you want to get under the hood a 
little or just skip ahead if you’re not interested in all the gory details.
 
This icon highlights an important point that you don’t want to forget because

Google AdSense is a great program to help you start monetizing your Web 
site. In this book, you can find all the information you need to get started 
using it and using it well. All programs change over time though, and new 
information becomes available for AdSense almost every week. Keep up with 
the changes at the Google AdSense blog (http://adsense.blogspot.
com/) and keep this book handy as a reference for the basics of using the 
program.

E
very book starts somewhere, and this one starts with 
the basics. Here you’ll get the information you need 
to know before you even begin using Google AdSense, as 
well as tips on how to better use AdSense after you do get 
started.
This part introduces you to Google AdSense and then gets 
you ready to use AdSense. Not only that, but you also find 
out how to create a Web site that’s designed well for 
showcasing your AdSense ads. Along the way, I discuss 
Search Engine Optimization as a way to increase traffic to 
your Web site — optimizing your AdSense earnings in the 
process, by the way — and I close by discussing how to 
install that pesky AdSense code.

ince the Internet first began in the early ’80s, it’s grown like kudzu in 
southern Alabama — faster than anyone can keep up with. The adoption 
of the Internet has been so rapid, in fact, that some companies are spend-
ing millions of dollars trying to find ways for third-world countries to have 
Internet availability.
Closer to home, however, it’s probably safe to say that the majority of people 
already have Internet access. It’s probably even safe to take that one step fur-
ther and say the majority of Internet users also have a Web site, a blog, both, 
or multiples of both. The Internet Economy has taken over.
Many of the people who use the Internet see it as a path to the business they 
always wanted to own but couldn’t because of the business ownership costs. 
Setting up a Web site is relatively inexpensive — add some e-commerce capa-
bilities and then connect a blog to it to advertise the existence of the site and 
the products or services offered on the site.
Even people who aren’t necessarily looking to start their own businesses are 
looking for a way to make money online. And that’s where Google AdSense 
comes into play.
Introduced in June 2003, AdSense offers anyone with any type of Internet real 
estate the ability to generate at least a small income from their efforts.
This chapter is for publishers — those who are interested in using AdSense to 
advertise on their Web sites. I cover the basics of what AdSense is and how 
to use it to generate income from your Web site.

Part I: AdSense Basics 
Understanding AdSense
AdSense is an advertising program that anyone who publishes a Web site can 
use to generate income for their Web site. But there’s one small condition — 
Google must approve your site before ads are shown on your site.
A longer explanation is that AdSense is an ad-placement program that utilizes 
Google’s proprietary search capabilities to determine the best placement for 
ads that are purchased through the Google AdWords program.
 
AdSense is contextual advertising, or ads that appear in the context of sur-
rounding content. What this means for you is that AdSense ads are related to 
the content of the pages on which those ads appear.
It sounds complicated, I know. And really it can be very complicated, but the 
bottom line is that with AdSense, you can place ads on your Web site that 
are targeted to the content of your site. So, if your site is about Chinese 
Crested dogs, ads for Web-based human resources applications don’t show 
on your site.
AdWords: The flip side of AdSense
AdSense is one-half of an advertising duo that 
Google has cooked up. The other half is Google 
AdWords, a pay-per-click keyword advertis-
ing program. (How smart is that? Having both 
advertisers and publishers as your customers!) 
In a pay-per-click advertising program, adver-
tisers place ads based on keywords that are 
related to their content. (Keywords, in this con-
text, means key terms or words that are com-
monly associated with a given subject, topic, 
service, or product.)
In pay-per-click advertising, advertisers create 
short, text-based ads that are very closely 
related to chosen keywords, and then allow 
those ads to be shown on other people’s Web 
sites that feature (in some way or another) the 
chosen keyword. The advertiser agrees to pay 
up to a certain dollar amount — called a bid — 
each time a Web site visitor clicks on the ad. 
Thus, the term pay-per-click.
The bid amount an advertiser placed on a key-
word is usually determined by two factors: 
the budget and the popularity of the keyword. 
The advertisers themselves set the daily budget 
for each advertisement — one built around 
how much they are willing to pay if someone 
clicks the ad. The bidding process itself sets 
how much a keyword is worth — clearly, more 
popular keywords are going to cost advertisers 
more.
The bidding process works much like any 
other auction process, with one minor change. 
Advertisers bid for placement of their ads by 
keyword, but more than one advertiser can 
win. The way it works is that the advertiser 
that has the highest bid has their ads shown in 
the most desirable places (both on Google and 
other Web sites). Bidders with lower bids will 
still have their ads shown, but in somewhat less 
desirable places. The “less desirable” places 
can still perform very well, and in fact are some-
times more coveted because they cost less, 
which means advertisers can afford to have 
their ads shown more often.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Google AdSense
In return for placing those ads on your site, you’re paid a small amount each 
time one of your site visitors clicks an ad, and in some cases, even when site 
visitors just see the ads.
Money Makes AdSense Go ’Round
Okay, so AdSense is (in essence) an advertising program. But why would 
you want to use it? Well, for the money, of course. AdSense is an easy way 
to generate income from your Web site, even if you’re not selling anything 
on the site.
And while creating income is the most likely reason that publishers use 
AdSense, it’s not the only one. Some publishers use AdSense as a means of 
making their Web site more valuable to site visitors.
 
Anyone who displays an AdSense ad is considered a publisher, whereas 
anyone who purchases the ads that are displayed through AdSense is an 
advertiser.
Now, this is where a lot of debate usually begins. Experts (who are usually 
people who know a lot just about a given subject) tend to disagree about 
the value of any type of advertising on your Web site. Some experts say that 
any advertisement that takes people away from your Web site is a bad thing. 
Others say that ads are okay, in the right places. You can read more about ad 
placement in Chapter 3.
When placed properly, AdSense ads can add value to your Web site by point-
ing users to other resources related to the topic of your site. This means 
they’ll probably surf away from your site at some point. But if your site is 
well built (which is essential if you intend to grow traffic over time), it’s likely 
that users will come back to your site again in the future.
The value here is that users not only get what they’re looking for, but you get 
return traffic; and because you’re using AdSense to help those users find the 
information they need, you’re also making a little extra money in the process.
Deciding Whether AdSense
Is Right for You
Even though there are a lot of benefits to using AdSense, it’s not for every-
one. Just like not everyone likes the idea of eating chocolate, there will be 

10
Part I: AdSense Basics 
some who aren’t willing to risk that AdSense ads push (or draw) traffic away 
from their Web sites.
One good example of this is if you have an e-commerce Web site that fea-
tures products on every page. Many e-commerce site owners aren’t willing to 
include advertisements on their pages because the ads can cause site visitors 
to surf away before they complete a purchase.
What it all really comes down to is to know how badly you would be hurt if a 
site visitor surfed away from your site. If the damage would be like cutting off 
your left hand, you probably don’t want to include AdSense on your site.
If, on the other hand (the right hand because it’s not been cut off yet), 
the possibility of a site visitor surfing away wouldn’t cost you any money, 
AdSense is probably worth considering. To be clear, a certain percentage of 
site visitors click an ad on a site and then don’t come back, either that day or 
at all. But that percentage is likely to be very small. If you won’t lose money if 
they don’t come back, why not try to make a little money?
Jenn Savedge, the owner of the blog The Green Parent (www.thegreenparent.
com), doesn’t use AdSense. She says, “I want to have complete control over the 
products that are advertised on my site. I don’t want it to appear as though I am 
endorsing products when I am not.” And that’s a valid reason to decide against 
using AdSense.
A good rule of thumb is generally that all content-only sites can afford to 
have AdSense ads displayed on some, if not all, pages on the site. Sites that 
sell stuff? Well, that’s a little trickier, but if you have pages that don’t contain 
links to purchase products (like product review pages, or articles that extol 
the value of a particular product or group of products), you can probably feel 
pretty secure about including AdSense ads on those pages.
Common AdSense Questions
If you’ve read to this point, you know just enough to be dangerous, which 
means you probably have a ton of questions about AdSense. Other chapters 
answer most of those questions for you, but to keep you focused, I answer a 
few of the more pressing questions now.
What follows are answers to a few of the more common questions that are 
usually asked about AdSense (which incidentally are probably the ones that 
you want the answers to the most).

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Google AdSense
How much money can I 
make with AdSense?
There’s just no easy answer to this question. Well, okay, there’s an easy 
answer — it depends. But that easy answer isn’t really useful. The problem 
is that several measurements impact your daily revenue from AdSense ads, 
such as
 
 Unique visits: A visitor is considered unique when she visits your Web 
site the first time during a given period of time. Depending on the
metric — the measurement used to track visitors on your Web site — 
that’s used, a visitor might be considered unique the first time he visits 
your site in a 24-hour period, the first time in a week, or the first time 
in an hour. For AdSense, the unique visits measurement is used to help 
determine the click-thru rate for ads.
 
 Click-thru rate (CTR) is the number of people who click an ad and are 
taken to the Web page designated for the advertisement. This page is 
usually a larger, more colorful ad, the opening page of a Web site, or a 
page that displays more information about the product or service fea-
tured in the ad.
 
 Average click-through-rate (CTR): The CTR is the actual number of 
visitors who click through an ad on your Web site. This is important 
because you’re paid when users click your AdSense ads.
 
 Average cost-per-click (CPC): The CPC is the amount that advertisers 
pay each time someone clicks one of their ads. This number varies 
widely and is dependent upon the cost of the keyword to which an ad is 
related. For you, as an AdSense publisher, the CPC is the basis for how 
much you’re paid.
Using these three measurements — measurements which are highly 
variable — you can estimate how much you could make based on some 
hypothetical numbers. For example, assume that your Web site gets 1,000 
unique visits per day and that the average value of the ads that are displayed 
on your site each day is $.25 per click (that’s the CPC). Finally, assume that 
about 2 percent of your 1,000 visitors click through the ads on your site each 
day. Now, you have numbers that you can work with.
With those hypothetical numbers in place, you can use this equation to esti-
mate how much you might make from your AdSense ads on a given day:
(unique visits x average CTR)average CPC = potential revenue
so
(1,000 x .02)$.25 = $5.00

12
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Using that equation and the hypothetical numbers I’ve defined, you could 
estimate that you’d make $5.00 per day, or $150.00 per month. Again, how-
ever, that’s assuming your numbers are exactly what I’ve defined here, and 
they probably won’t be — these are completely fictional numbers used solely 
for the purpose of example.
Any change in those numbers — more or less visitors, higher or lower CTR, 
or more or less average CPC — results in different numbers.
I can hear you wailing in frustration — “So what can I realistically expect 
to earn with AdSense?” I understand your desire for solid numbers, but the 
truth is, I can’t give you an exact figure. More accurately, I can tell you that if 
your site is well-targeted and has high traffic levels, you can expect to make 
pretty good money (at least enough to get a check every month). And if your 
site traffic is slower or your site isn’t as highly targeted, you might be lucky 
to make enough to pay for your Web site hosting each month.
 
In an effort to keep costs down, Google doesn’t release payments until you’ve 
earned $100 or more in ad revenues. If you make less than $100 in a given 
month, your earnings will be held until you reach the $100 minimum. So, if 
you’re not making enough money, you’ll get your payment eventually, just not 
right away.
Fortunately, there are ways to optimize your Web pages so that you get the 
most possible return on your AdSense ads. I cover those strategies through-
out the rest of this book.
How much does AdSense cost?
Easy question, easier answer. AdSense doesn’t cost you a thing. Well, it doesn’t 
cost you a thing unless you consider the time that it takes to implement the 
ads on your Web site. But even this step isn’t overly time-consuming, so even 
labor costs should be minimal.
What kind of ads will show 
on my Web site?
The advertising kind.
Okay. All jokes aside, the ads that show on your site are determined by the 
content of your site. Google uses a search algorithm to determine what ads 
are best suited for your site — an algorithm that’s quite similar to the one 
Google uses when you run a search query from the Google search pages or 
through a Web site-based search box.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Google AdSense
That said, it’s possible that the ads that show on your site might have noth-
ing at all to do with the content of the site. Here’s why: If your site content 
isn’t very focused, the algorithm gets confused and isn’t sure which ads are 
appropriate. So, it makes its best guess, which may or may not be correct.
The best way to ensure that the ads are highly relevant to your content is to 
have well-focused, keyword-rich content. You can find guidelines for putting 
together the best content for your site in Chapter 3.
Can I control ad content?
No one wants ads from their competitors on their Web site. Even if you’re not 
selling anything from your site, it’s likely that some ads you just don’t want 
shown on your site.
Fortunately, Google’s made it possible to exclude some companies from 
showing their ads on your site. It’s not too difficult to do; simply ad your 
competitors’ URLs (Uniform Resource Locator, the Web address) to your ad 
filters, and the competition is then blocked from advertising on your site.
You can find more information on filtering the ads that are shown on your 
site in Chapter 5.
Can I use AdSense on more 
than one Web site?
Sure you can, and here are a couple ways to do it. First, you can use the same 
AdSense code on all your sites, and the metrics — the tracking measure-
ments, like number of clicks and payment for clicks — are all collected in the 
same report with no way to differentiate the Web site.
The other way you can track multiple sites (or even different pages within 
the same site) is to use Google channels. Channels simply allow you to track 
different sites or pages on a site by using code that’s written to indicate each 
separate channel you set up.
You can set up channels by URL or by custom-defined differentiators. You 
can find out about the fine art of using channels effectively in Chapter 14.

14
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Can I have more than one 
AdSense account?
Having more than one account might seem like a good idea in certain situa-
tions. For example, if you run multiple Web sites, you might want to have a 
different AdSense account for each of those sites.
Google doesn’t think that’s such a great idea.
You’re limited to a single AdSense account per payee. You can differentiate 
between ads on your various Web sites with the channels that I mention ear-
lier in the preceding section, but having two accounts is a no-no.
 
Google’s very sensitive about the ways in which publishers use AdSense capa-
bilities. Reading through the AdSense program policies before you even being 
to set AdSense up for your Web site is a very good idea. Google won’t think 
twice about banning policy violators from using AdSense.
The Potential of AdSense
Okay, AdSense seems relatively simple, so what’s all the fuss about? Well, the 
easy answer to that is money. Publishers use AdSense because it’s a potential 
revenue stream that might not otherwise be available to them.
In some rare cases, you may have heard of AdSense publishers making 
$20,000 or more each month. Those are rare cases, but it’s possible to build 
a decent revenue stream with AdSense if you manage the use of the ads care-
fully on sites that are very well designed. Is it likely that you’ll get rich? No.
What is likely is that you might be able to make enough to cover your Web 
site hosting or even enough to cover your mortgage. AdSense definitely has 
the potential. How you manage the program combined with how well your 
site is designed and the amount of traffic that your site receives determine 
how much you make.
In the coming pages, you can find out about all the tips and secrets that will 
help you maximize the potential of AdSense for your Web site. It all starts in 
Chapter 2, where I walk you through how to sign up for an AdSense account 
and get it set up on your site, so keep reading. Plenty more information is to 
come.

f you want to find out what AdSense is, check out Chapter 1. (Too busy to 
read Chapter 1? Here’s the barebones definition — AdSense is ad space on 
your Web page or blog that you lease to advertisers.) Now, I think definitions 
are all well and good, but it’s time to get started using AdSense to generate a 
little income from your Web site, don’t you know? Before I get too deep into 
the hows, though, I need to address a few whys.
Probably one of the greatest reasons to use AdSense is to tap into the 
growing Web advertising market, a market expected to reach about $18.9 
billion dollars by 2010 if you can believe the folks at Jupiter Research. 
(You can read all about it at www.jupitermedia.com/corporate/
releases/05.08.15-newjupresearch2.html.) And if you could have 
a fraction of a percent of that market, wouldn’t it be worth a few minutes of 
your time to set up an AdSense account?
Of course, you’re probably thinking to yourself, “Self, if that much advertis-
ing revenue is available on the Web, why don’t I just go straight to the source 
and cut out the middle man?”
You could. After all, why in the world would you want to give Google a por-
tion of the income that you can generate selling advertising space on your 
Web site?
Okay, okay. I give. The question was a setup. The truth is I can think of a few 
(very good) reasons that it might be worth losing a small portion of your 
advertising revenue to allow Google to handle the logistics:

16
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
 Ease of advertising sales: You could find out which advertisers are 
putting their ads on your site and go straight to them to cut a deal for 
advertising that would cut Google right out of the picture. But would you 
know who to contact? And would you know how to go about convincing 
the advertiser to put his ads on your site? Probably not. Instead, Google 
handles those sales issues for you, and that alone justifies the premium 
that Google gets from connecting advertisers with ad publishers.
 
 Availability of time: Think of it like this: You can make and bake home-
made bread to go along with your dinner every single night, but it’s time-
consuming and bread’s available on the grocery store shelves that you 
don’t have to knead, let rise, or bake. And that bread is just as good as 
anything most people could make at home (and in a lot of cases, much 
better!). AdSense is the same. You could track down the sales, negotiate 
the deals, design the ads, and then connect your site to the advertiser’s 
site. But why would you spend time on that when you could let Google 
do it, place a couple lines of code in the design of your Web site, and 
then sit back and wait for the clicks to happen? Time is at a premium, 
and you have better ways to spend that premium than on the 
time-consuming activities that go along with selling, designing, and 
implementing advertising on your Web site.
 
 Avoidance of technological frustrations: Those ads that are placed on 
your Web site when you sign up for AdSense are created by someone. 
Usually that someone is a tech geek of some kind who not only knows 
what works in online advertising but also knows how to program pages 
or sections of pages to see, display, and update advertisements regu-
larly. Are you that someone? Most of the time, the answer to that ques-
tion is no, you’re not the tech guru. If you were, you’d be in advertising 
and wouldn’t need this book. It just makes more sense to allow someone 
who knows how to handle the situation to handle it. That frees you up to 
do tasks that are more essential to making money.
Setting Up for AdSense
One misconception that I had when I wanted to start using AdSense was that 
it would be difficult and time-consuming to set up. Boy, was I wrong! Setting 
up the account doesn’t require your first born child or your signature in 
blood. Setting up the account takes only a few minutes and a minimum of 
information. But how you set up the account is determined by whether you 
already have a Google account.
Having a Google account isn’t a requirement, but it can be useful. If you don’t 
have a Google account, you’re missing out on other Google applications, like 
Gmail (Google’s Web mail program), possibly AdWords (the other side of 
AdSense; it’s a pay-per-click advertising program in which you only pay for 

17
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
ads that users click), and Google Analytics (a Web site traffic measurement 
program that tells you all kinds of cool information about who visits your site 
and what they do while they’re there). A Google account makes connecting 
all these applications considerably easier, too.
 
If you’re going to use AdSense, you most definitely want to have some kind of 
Web site analytics program. A Web site analytics program tracks the number 
of visitors to your site and some of their behaviors while they’re on your site. 
You can use a program like AWStats or ClickTracks, but those programs are 
nowhere near as easy to use as Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is free, and it integrates with AdWords and AdSense, so it 
makes it easy to track your efforts in those programs. You may also want a 
program that’s easy to understand and use. Google Analytics fits that bill, 
too. And did I mention the program is free?
But I digress.
One reason that many people choose not to have a Google account is 
because they don’t like the way that Google collects personal information. 
People fear that because Google’s claim to fame is its ability to analyze the 
heck out of online information, it’ll use its expertise to dredge up all the per-
sonal information that it can about them. To some people it just feels far too 
much like Big Brother is watching.
AdSense only Web sites
You need to know one more detail before you 
even start to set up your AdSense account. 
Many people set up AdSense strictly to build 
Web pages with the singular purpose of entic-
ing users to click the ads. You’ve seen these 
pages on the Web; they’re all similar to the 
one shown below. The pages contain a small 
amount of text and lots of links, ads, and search 
boxes — all of which are usually linked to 
AdSense or a service like it.
If this is the type of page that you’re planning to 
construct and connect to your AdSense account, 
don’t bother. The page may stay up for a few 
weeks or even a couple of months, but Google 
will find it, and when they do, that’s it. Google will 
ban you from the AdSense program.
If you’re truly interested in making a little money 
with AdSense, don’t try to cheat the system. 
Working within Google’s guidelines is a per-
fectly profitable way to make some extra cash 
that you can depend on for a long time to come. 
It’s also not as difficult as it might seem when 
you first read through the guidelines and pro-
gram policies.

 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
In my experience, however, Google hasn’t used my personal information for 
anything more than what I want it used for. I have a Google account, mul-
tiple Gmail accounts, a Google Analytics account, and accounts with Google 
AdWords and AdSense (and a couple dozen other Google applications and 
accounts that I won’t list here). Not once in the past decade has Google used 
my information inappropriately. And I’m pretty careful about who I give my 
information out to. If you’re still not convinced, Google has a pretty rigor-
ous Privacy policy in place to protect you. You can find that policy at www.
google.com/privacy.html.
If, after reading that document, you still don’t want to register with Google, 
you can jump to the instructions for opening an AdSense account if you don’t 
have a Google account. Otherwise, you can set up a Google account while 
you’re setting up your AdSense account. And if you already have a Google 
account, you’re one step ahead of everyone else.
One more note about setting up a Google AdSense account: Some experts 
suggest that you should have an AdSense account that’s separate from your 
other Google accounts. The purpose behind having them separate is so that 
there are no repercussions should you accidentally end up in Google’s bad 
graces with your AdSense efforts. I think that caution is unfounded.
Unless you plan to use your AdSense account in a manner that’s prohibited 
by Google, you should run into no problems at all. And I find that it’s much 
easier to have an AdSense account that’s as easy to access as all the other 
Google applications that you use. One difficulty that I’ve discovered is the 
frustration of not having your AdSense account connected to other accounts, 
especially Google Analytics and AdWords.
You have to decide what you’re most comfortable doing: using your existing 
Google account, creating a new Google account, or not using one at all. But 
no matter what your preferences are, you can still get started with AdSense 
(even if not effectively) as soon as you get the approval from Google.
Taking the Plunge
If you have a Google account that you want to use when you set up your 
AdSense account, here are the steps for setting up the account:
 
1. Point your browser to the AdSense Web site at www.adsense.com.
 
2. Click the Sign Up Now button, as shown in Figure 2-1.

Sign Up Now button
 
3. Fill in the requested information on the form that appears (shown in 
Figure 2-2) and then click the Submit Information button.
 
 The information you’ll be requested to enter includes
 
• Your Web site URL: Google will check the site to ensure it’s appro-
priate for ads to be displayed.
 
• Your Web site language: To ensure that AdSense is available to your 
site visitors and that any ads placed are properly targeted to the 
main language of your site.
 
• Type of account: Use this drop-down menu to select whether you’re 
creating a personal account or a business account. (If the account 
is for you, it’s personal, and if you plan to use it as part of a busi-
ness that you own, it’s a business account.)
 
• Country or territory: You do know where you live, don’t you?
 
• The payee name: This is the name under which you want your 
payments issued. If you’re creating a personal account, it should 
be your personal name. If you’re creating a business account, it’s 
best to use the business name, but you can also use your personal 
name if you prefer.
 
 Payments are made electronically or by check, but you set that 
information up after you’ve created your AdSense account, so for 
now all you need to know is to whom and where payments should 
be sent.
 
• Address and telephone number: Use the address where you would 
like to have your payments sent, and be sure to include a working 
telephone number in case the good people at AdSense need to con-
tact you concerning payments. You also need to select the I Agree 

21
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
that I Can Receive Checks Made Out to the Payee Name I Have 
Listed Above check box. This just ensures that you’re aware that 
the name you have selected in the Payee Name portion of the form 
is the name your checks will be made out to.
 
• Email preferences: If you want to receive the AdSense newsletter 
and surveys about AdSense, place a check mark in the In Addition,

• Who referred you: Use the drop-down menu provided to tell Google 
how you heard about AdSense. This information is likely used to 
help them effectively market the AdSense service.
 
• Agree to AdSense program policies: The last part of the form is 
where you register your agreement or disagreement with the 
AdSense program policies. Be sure to read these policies com-
pletely (a link to them is provided on the form). If you don’t agree 
to the program’s policies, you will not be approved for an AdSense 
account. Two of the four check boxes on this list are the most 
important points in the program policies. The third check box is 
your agreement (if you agree) and the fourth check box is just con-
firmation that you don’t already have an AdSense account. (You’re 
only allowed to have one, so don’t try registering another because 
it will be refused.) All four of these check boxes must be selected.
 
 Don’t blow off the Policies section. You need to read the policies and 
make sure you understand them because Google strictly requires that 
publishers (AdSense users) adhere to these policies. Slip up, and Google 
will strip your AdSense capabilities so fast you’ll wonder if there’s some 
capability-stripping super power out there that you’ve never heard of.

 If you select the first option, you can jump right to the next section.
 
 If you select the second option, a new form appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-3.
 
5a. If you select the second option, choose a new e-mail address for the 
account, designate and confirm a password for the account, and then 
enter the verification word. When you’re finished, click Continue.
 
 A Gmail account will be created for you, using the e-mail address you 
select.

I’d Like to Choose a New Login Name and Password Just for AdSense.
 
 If you choose to use your existing Google account for AdSense, a form

a password (and confirm it), and then enter the verification word and 
click Continue.
 
6. Wait.
 
 First you have to wait for an e-mail confirmation from AdSense. That 
should arrive in your e-mail Inbox within a matter of minutes.
 
 After you’ve confirmed your e-mail address, you have to wait a little 
longer for approval of your account. But don’t wait too long. Google 
should only take a few days to approve or deny your application for an 
AdSense account.

One question you may have is whether you really need a Gmail address to 
complete the AdSense application. The answer is no. I can sing the praises of 
Gmail — Google’s Web mail program. I’ve had an account since the program 
was in beta testing, and it’s the best Web-based e-mail program you’ll find. But 
it’s not necessary to have one. Any e-mail address will suffice. Just be sure it’s 
an e-mail address that you have access to because that’s where Google sends 
your communications from AdSense, and you must be able to access those 
communications to verify your account.

Understanding Google’s Policies
If you’ve read anything at all online about AdSense, you’ve probably seen the 
phrase “familiarize yourself with the AdSense Program Policies” at least as 
many times as you’ve seen the moon. There’s good reason for that.

26
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Google is very strict about AdSense users (publishers, in their jargon) follow-
ing the guidelines set forth in the AdSense Program Policies document. If you 
don’t adhere to the program policies, Google reserves the right to disable 
your AdSense account. And Google will — faster than you can say “What did 
I do wrong?” They’re that serious about the guidelines because the appear-
ance of your site and your adherence to their guidelines determine how 
people view the advertisements. Google wants to be in users’ good graces, 
and your cooperation helps to accomplish that.
The program policies aren’t filled with quite as much legalese as you might 
find in other policy documents, but you’ll encounter ten-dollar words like pur-
suant. Here’s a quick list of what you’ll encounter in the policy document:
 
 Legalese
 
 Invalid clicks and impressions
 
 Encouraging clicks
 
 Site content
 
 Copyrighted materials
 
 Webmaster Guidelines
 
 Site and ad behavior
 
 Ad placement
 
 Competitive ads and services
 
 Product-specific policies
In the next few sections, I deal with each of these points in greater detail. 
(Remember: This is just an overview. Read the document completely before 
you agree to the policy requirements of the program.)
Legalese
The document starts with an explanation of Google’s legal rights. Basically, 
the Google lawyers are telling you that you need to be nicer and follow the 
guidelines Google sets forth or Google can — and will, if it becomes nec-
essary — disable your AdSense account. The rub here is that after your 
account is disabled, you’re just finished. You can’t use AdSense anymore. 
(Yes, you could try to cheat fate by creating a new account, but if Google 
finds out it’s you, they’ll just shut you down all over again.)

27
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
Invalid clicks and impressions
“Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest.”
That’s the first line of the most highly debated section of the program poli-
cies. This section of the policy lays out the guidelines for what constitutes a 
valid click. If you click your own ads, those clicks are invalid. If you program 
(or purchase) some piece of software to click your ads, those clicks are 
invalid. And these types of invalid clicks are click fraud. Click fraud is fraudu-
lently clicking your own or someone else’s ads with the intent of affecting 
AdSense revenues or AdWords costs and is enough to get you banned from 
AdSense completely, no questions asked — and please don’t re-apply.
A valid click or impression has these qualities:
 
 It’s initiated by a real user to your Web site.
 
 The actual click is performed by a real, live person.
 
 The click is the result of genuine interest in the content of the advertise-
ment by the real, live person.
Any clicks that don’t meet these requirements can be (and usually are) 
considered invalid clicks. Clicking your own ad even one time could get you 
banned from AdSense. It’s not worth it.
You don’t have to say it. I hear your objection: How are you supposed to 
know how the ads apply to your site if you can’t follow them? Or how will you 
know how the ads will look or how they will integrate into your Web site?
Well . . . it’s half about trust and half about testing. Trying to view every 
single ad that’s shown on your Web site probably isn’t prudent. Because ads 
rotate constantly and each site visitor might see a different ad set — also 
called an ad group or an ad block — you probably couldn’t view all the ads, 
even if you wanted to.
Instead, AdSense has a testing capability — the AdSense preview tool. It’s a 
small application you have to download and add to your computer’s registry, 
which allows you to see what the ads look like and how they behave without 
having to click your own ads.
Download the preview tool from the AdSense Help Center at https://www.
google.com/adsense/support/. In the Help Center, search for preview 
tool. You should be taken to a search results page where the top result is a 
link to the page from which you can download the preview tool. The directions 
on the page walk you through downloading and installing the preview tool.
Here’s one catch: If you’re a Firefox user, the preview tool won’t be much 
help. It only works with Internet Explorer. For the purposes of preview-
ing your AdSense ad blocks, it might be wise to keep Internet Explorer as a 

28
Part I: AdSense Basics 
backup browser. You don’t have to use it all the time — just when you want 
to preview your AdSense ad blocks.
Encouraging clicks
The next section of the AdSense Program Policy document addresses the 
kinds of things you shouldn’t pull in an attempt to encourage people to 
click on your ads. I know this is a little negative, but it’s important that 
you pay attention to these no-nos because ignoring them could have dire 
consequences.
You can’t point out ads. You can’t pay people to click your ads. You also 
can’t use any kind of misleading titling around the ads (for example, using 
a Favorite Sites title when the ads really are just advertisements), and you 
must be cautious about the graphics you include around ad blocks. If they’re 
at all misleading and appear to be associated with the ads, that’s more fodder 
for the banning machine.
In short, all you can really do to encourage ad unit clicks is to place the ads 
in the best possible locations. Make them appealing with the design tools 
that Google provides and then leave them alone. Much more than that and 
you run the risk of landing on Google’s black list.
Site content
Here’s where the program policies begin to get interesting. Okay, not really. 
There is rarely anything interesting about program policies. But a lot of meat 
is in this section of the program policies, and you should pay close attention 
to what’s here.
Google’s requirements for site content are basic: no violent content, no adult 
content, nothing related to gambling, and nothing associated with any type of 
illegal activities. But that’s not all. Google also frowns on Web sites that are 
related to anything that could be construed as controversial — tobacco, alco-
hol, prescription drugs, and weaponry of any kind. Google stops just short of 
disallowing ads on political pages, though that might not be a bad idea.
Think of it this way: If you were Google, what would you not want your name 
associated with? Just about anything you come up with will probably be on 
the restricted list that Google’s created. Read the list closely. Google doesn’t 
accept I didn’t know as a good excuse for violating the policies.

29
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
Copyrighted materials
This should really go without saying, but plagiarized content will ensure that 
Google pulls your AdSense access. Copyright infringement is a serious crime; 
one that’s more prevalent on the Internet than grains of sand on a beach. 
Many people mistakenly believe that because articles and other content 
on the Web are on the Web, they’re free for anyone to use. That’s not the 
case, and Google is a bulldog in the copyright protection arena. The Google 
crawler, which is the program that looks at your Web site to determine the 
main topics, or keywords, that are relevant to the site, can determine if the 
content on your page is original or if it appears in another place on the Web. 
If it’s not original and you can’t prove you have permission to use it, you’ll 
pay the price. So, be kind; use original content.
Take the time to read about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and 
Google’s stance on that piece of legislation. The details are on the Web at 
www.google.com/adsense_dmca.html. Not only will copyright infringe-
ment and plagiarism get you banned from AdSense, but they can also get you 
thrown in jail, so use original content. You not only protect your investment 
in AdSense, but your Web site will probably rank better in search results, too, 
because search engines — and site visitors — love fresh, original content. 
Having fresh, original content would naturally make your site more popular.
Webmaster Guidelines
Google’s Webmaster Guidelines tell you everything you need to know about 
what the company expects from the design of a Web site. The document is 
pretty complicated, but it can be summed up in one word: simplicity.
Keep your Web site simple, easy to use, and relevant to your site visitors, and 
you shouldn’t run into any problems with Google where site design is con-
cerned. Of course, it still doesn’t hurt to familiarize yourself with and follow 
the Webmaster Guidelines. Read them here:
www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769#quality
 
A more in-depth discussion of Google’s Webmaster Guidelines can be found 
in Chapter 3. There’s even a bonus to using this set of guidelines — Google is 
the search engine to rank in. Following these guidelines helps ensure that you 
rank well in its search results.

30
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Site and ad behavior
Need a few more guidelines for how your site should be designed? Not neces-
sarily? Well, tough because Google’s giving a few more anyway. In this sec-
tion of the program policies, Google outlines yet more no-nos. You can’t use 
pop-ups or pop-unders in your site design. (Pop-ups are those annoying little 
windows that pop up out of nowhere when you click a link leading to a Web 
site or when you click away from the site. Pop-unders are the same except the 
window appears under your Web browser so you don’t see them until you 
close the browser window.)
You also can’t try to deceive your visitors into clicking through ads by dis-
guising the ads or hiding them within text, behind graphics, or in the back-
ground of the Web page. The ads must appear as ads and not as sponsored 
links of any kind.
And to take it all one step further, Google also has Landing Page Quality 
Guidelines to help ensure that your landing page — the first page that site 
visitors land on when they click into your Web site — is designed well and 
adheres to the AdSense Program Policy requirements. These guidelines ask 
the following of you and your site:
 
 That you have relevant and original content on your site
 
 That your site is clear in your intent and the nature of your business (if 
that’s relevant)
 
 That it’s clear how your visitors’ information will be used
 
 That users can find their way around your site, or navigate the site, 
easily
 
I recommend checking out the full set of Landing Page Quality Guidelines at 
https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=
46675&hl=en.
The real key to staying in Google’s good graces (for both search engine rank-
ing and the AdSense program) is to design your Web site with the end user 
in mind. If you’re designing a site strictly to collect ad clicks, you might get 
a high number of visitors for a short time, but that number will fall like a 
penny dropped from the Empire State building as soon as users figure out 
what you’re up to. Or worse, Google will figure it out first and ban you from 
AdSense and probably from search engine rankings, too.
A much better idea is to design your site for site visitors. Provide the infor-
mation that visitors are looking for. They’ll spend more time on your site, 
which means more exposure to AdSense ads, which means ultimately more 
clicks. And Google will leave you alone to make your money. Not a bad trade 
for doing things the right way instead of trying to deceive site visitors.

31
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
Ad placement
In case there was any doubt, Google set up guidelines for how and where ad 
units can be placed on your site. The policy document lists the particulars, 
but it’s safe to say that Google wants ads tastefully displayed and in context.
Google also doesn’t want visitors overwhelmed by the number of ads on a 
page, so, you’ll also find guidelines for how many ad blocks of each type you 
can have on any given Web page.
More information about how to actually place ads on your Web site — as well 
as information about creating appealing ads — can be found in Chapter 5.
Competitive ads and services
This isn’t about your competition; it’s about Google’s competition. Like any 
good contender, Google doesn’t want competitors competing for its share of 
the prize money. So, you can’t display ads from any competing services that 
could be confused with AdSense ads.
For example, it’s okay to include ads on your site from Amazon or other retail 
services. And you can even include other pay-per-click ads, as long as they 
don’t mimics AdSense ads. Ads that look like they belong to AdSense but do 
not are a real no-no — that could really stir Google’s pot!
Google stops just this side of saying you can’t use other advertising services, but 
only because denying your freedom to use any program without thought of how it 
could be misconstrued as a Google capability is creating a monopoly. And monopo-
lies draw the attention of Big Brother. He’s a sibling no one wants to spend time with.
Product-specific policies
AdSense has a few different divisions, such as Internet ads, video ads, radio 
ads, and a massive variety of content ads. Google is slowing working into 
many other types of advertising as well. Because there are so many different 
types of media in which you can use AdSense, and all those media differ in 
some way, there have to be policies that directly address some of the differ-
ences for each medium. You can find those guidelines at www.google.com/
adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=71600.
The AdSense Program Policy document seems pretty tame on first glance. 
But as you look closer at the contents of the policy, you can quickly see that 
there are additional bits and pieces about those program policies scattered 
behind several different Web links. And after you start getting into those 
links, you can truly see how complicated Google’s policies get.

32
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Don’t skip anything, though. Read through all the policy documentation and 
then read it all again. And read it again as you need to, to stay on the right 
side of Google’s good graces, because if you get booted, it’s hard to reestab-
lish your presence on the Web.
Creating Your First Set of Ads
You created your account, waited, and were approved. Now AdSense is 
active. Now you can fill that blank space on your Web site with money-gener-
ating ads. But first you have to set up your ads.
Log in to your new AdSense account by using the username and password 
that you set up during the registration process. The page that appears at 
login is the Reports tab (AdSense always opens to this), which features 
a quick overview of your earnings and the reports that are available for 
AdSense. Because you don’t have any data to be reported yet, you’ll have a 
big, fat zero on that page, much like the one shown in Figure 2-6.
If you want to change that big fat zero into something a bit more lucrative, 
you need to set up a few ad blocks. Here’s how:
 
1. If you haven’t already done so, log in to your AdSense account.
 
2. Click the AdSense Setup tab, immediately to the right of the 
Reports tab.
 
 A page like the one in Figure 2-7 appears.
 
Figure 2-6: 
This will 
always be 
your starting 
point when 
you log in to 
AdSense.

Figure 2-7: 
The AdSense 
Setup page 
is where 
you choose 
which type of 
ad you want 
to create.
 
 
3. On this page, select the type of ad block you want to set up.
 
 For this example, go ahead and select AdSense for Content. The other 
options are covered in later chapters.
 
 The page that appears is the first step in the Ad Wizard, which walks 
you through setting up your ad.
 
 If you prefer a single-page form instead of using the wizard, click the 
wizard’s Single Page link. The information you’re asked to enter is the 
same, but on the single-page form, you just scroll down the page instead 
of clicking a Continue button.
 
4. Choose your ad type and click Continue.
 
 Your choices here are
 
• Ad Units: A graphical text box (as shown in Figure 2-8) inside of 
which linked ads are displayed.
 
• Link Units: A set of linked keywords (as shown in Figure 2-9) that 
lead to advertisers’ pages.
 
 Just to keep it simple for now, select Ad Unit.

34
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
Figure 2-8:

ad unit.
 
 
Figure 2-9: 
A link ad unit.
 
 
5. In the new page that appears, choose the size of ad you want to have 
appear on your Web site.
 
 Google offers a variety of different shapes, sizes, and types of ad for-
mats. The format that works best for you depends on the space you 
have available, the content of your Web site, and the design of the page 
on which the ad appears. For now, select 234 x 60 Half Banner from the 
Format drop-down menu. (I give you all the details about ad styles and 
formats in Chapter 7, when I cover designing the perfect content ad.)
 
6. On the same page, choose a color scheme for your ad.
 
 Google has several pre-made color schemes available in the drop-down 
list to the right, or you have the option to specify border, title, back-
ground, text, and URL colors by hexadecimal number. This is useful if 
you know the exact hexadecimal numbers of your Web page design and 
want to match them.
 
 For your purposes, select Seaside from the drop-down list.
 
7. Still on the same page, choose Slightly Rounded Corners from the 
Corner Styles drop-down list.
 
 The other options available here are Squared Corners or Very Rounded 
Corners. Visually, each has a different appeal to people in different situa-
tions and on different Web sites.
 
8. For the last option on the page, choose Show Public Service Ads from 
the drop-down list and click Continue.
 
 What’s this about public service ads? Well, Google shows public service 
ads when your site is so new that it can’t be properly populated with 
paid ads and when your site content doesn’t match ad content. You can 
choose to have these ads displayed, to have ads from another service 
displayed, or to have a solid color displayed as a placeholder if either of 
these situations applies.
 
9. In the new page that appears, click Continue.
 
 This page of the wizard gives you the option to assign the ad to a chan-
nel, but you have not yet set up channels. I show you how to set up 

35
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
channels in Chapter 14. For now, channels aren’t an aspect of AdSense 
that you need to worry about. They’re for tracking your ads, but before 
you can track them you need to know how to create them and get the 
highest percentage of clicks possible. After all, tracking nothing — which 
is exactly how many clicks you’ll have if you do your ads wrong — still 
leaves you with nothing to track.
 
10. In the new (and final) page that appears, enter a name for your ad unit 
in the appropriate field and then click the Save and Get Code button.
 
 When the page appears, a default name is already filled into the Name 
text box. I recommend renaming the ad unit something useful, but if you 
want to leave the default name, that’s fine.
 
 The page shown in Figure 2-10 appears with the code for your ad unit.
 
11. Copy the code provided by AdSense and paste it into the HTML code 
of your Web site.
 
 How you access your HTML code depends on how you got your code in 
the first place. If you’re using an HTML Editor/Web Page Creation program 
to design your Web site, you may need to dig around the menus to find out 
how to get the raw HTML code on-screen. If you’re writing your code from 
scratch, though, all you need to do is pull up the Web site code and paste 
the ad code into the spot on which you want AdSense ads to appear.
 
Creating the ad for your Web site is an easy process. Getting it to appear on 
the right spot on your Web site might be a little bit like landing a jumbo jet in 
the median of the New Jersey Turnpike. It’ll take a little practice, and in the 
beginning, it could get a little hairy.

One resource you may find helpful during the implementation process is the

The one thing you need to remember is that this is just an exercise in creat-
ing your first ad block. There are more details to implementing ads that work 
than there are quills on a porcupine. So maybe you do have an ad that you 
think is ready to go online, but it might not be. You can put it online now, and 
tweak it as you have time. Or, flip through some of the more detailed chap-
ters about creating specific types of ads. Putting a basic ad on your Web site 
probably won’t hurt you, but your time might be better spent figuring out 
how to make that ad really sing to your site visitors.
A note about public service ads
The subject of public service ads has come up 
once in this chapter already. Here’s the scoop 
on public service ads.
Basically, a public service ad is an ad that Google 
places in an AdSense ad block when there are 
no appropriate ads to be displayed in that space 
at that time. One time when you’re likely to see 
public service ads is when you’ve first added the 
AdSense code to your Web site.
In order to serve ads to your Web page that 
match the content of the page, Google peri-
odically examines — or crawls — the site to 
determine the content of the site. Then ads are 
pushed out to your Web site based on that con-
tent. When you’ve first put the AdSense code on 
your site, it takes a few hours (and sometimes 
even a couple of days) for Google to crawl the 
site to examine the content. Until that happens, 
the company wants something displayed in the 
space that you’ve made available, so public 
service ads are the filler.
The problem with public service ads is just 
that — they’re part of a public service, which 
means you don’t get paid when they’re viewed 
or clicked. So you don’t want to have those ads 
hanging around any longer than necessary — 
you do want to start making money as soon as 
possible, right?
If public service ads display for more than a 
few days, contact Google to make sure that 
your site is being crawled regularly. You can’t 
ask the company to specifically crawl your Web 
site (well, you can ask them, but they won’t do 
it), but you can find out if there’s something that 
you can do to speed up the process.
It’s possible that your site design is causing 
the public service ads to be displayed, too. If 
Google’s Web crawler can’t determine the 
topic of your Web page, the public service ads 
remain in place. This happens when pages are 
largely graphical in nature or when the content 
on a page isn’t coherent enough for the crawler 
to determine the overall theme of the page. If 
the crawler can’t understand your site design, 
it can’t target the right ads to your site. And 
that’s all the more reason to familiarize yourself 
with Google’s policies and guidelines and apply 
them to your site design.
If everything is in order, after a few hours or maybe 
even a couple of days (or whenever Google crawls 
your site), the ads are replaced with actual paid 
ads and you can begin making money.

37
 Chapter 2: Getting Started with AdSense
Creating ads seems easy enough. Even getting the ads to display isn’t all that 
difficult. However, getting site visitors to take note of those ads is a com-
pletely different tale. One way that you can get users to click your ads is to 
ensure they appear in the right context on your Web site. In Chapter 3, you 
find out about building content-rich Web sites and how you can optimize 
your Web site content for AdSense. Use those tips to help create pages that 
are complemented by the ads Google dishes out to your site.

ontent is the main draw to your Web site. I say this even though I’m 
the first to admit that pictures can be very cool and that you can do 
some pretty amazing (and some not-so-amazing) stuff with your pages using 
Flash animation. When I’m being charitable, I can even see the rationale for 
all kinds of other electronic bling some folks insist on adding to their pages. 
All that’s beside the point, though; what brings users to your site and draws 
them deeper and deeper into your pages is content.
Admittedly, one could argue that content is more than merely words — it’s all 
the elements that make up your Web site, even the bling. But it’s the words 
that help visitors find your site because words can be strung together to 
form information — and finding the right information is the goal of nearly 
every person who surfs the Web.
So having the right kind of content is one key to AdSense success. There’s 
such a thing as having the wrong kind of content or even having too much 
content. Having the right amount and the right kind of content is a balancing 
act. With careful attention to detail, you can keep all your plates dancing on 
their assigned poles.
The Big Deal about Content
Content is king! Bet you’ve heard that a few times before, right? It’s an over-
used phrase that’s lost some of its impact. It’s still true though — content is 
king. And without enough content (and enough of the right kind of content) 
on your Web site, you might as well toss the keys to your Web domain down 
the nearest sewer drain because the domain will be worthless.

Part I: AdSense Basics 
Think about what’s really motivating you when you surf the Internet. Go 
ahead — pay close attention to what you do the next few times you go online. 
To help you remember, keep a list of the Web sites you visit and what you 
do while you’re there. I bet the search for information is the unifying theme 
to all your Internet sessions. Information is content — words, pictures, audio, 
and video — that relay the information you need when you’re online. That’s 
one of the reasons why search engines like Google have grown exponentially 
in size and popularity. People want information, and they want the best pos-
sible way to get to exactly what they need in the least amount of time.
 
You can tap into that desire for information and use AdSense to generate a 
decent income, but only if you have the content that draws visitors to your 
site in the first place. Your site visitors care about content (or information), 
and you should, too.
Content draws visitors to your site, and keeps them on your site or causes 
them to return. Content equals traffic — but here’s the catch. Content only 
translates to traffic if the content is relevant and fresh. Old content or com-
pletely unrelated content doesn’t do you any more good than old fish — it 
stinks up the place and makes people want to be somewhere else.
Good content is a good thing — I think we can all agree on that. You may ask 
how good content ties in with AdSense and your desire to turn your Web 
site into a handy little income stream. It turns out that content is also what 
Google uses to target ads on your Web site. In fact, Google uses the same 
technology to target AdSense ads that it uses to create search results. A soft-
ware program — called a Web crawler, a spyder, or a bot — literally counts the 
number of times different words are used on your site and examines the words 
surrounding them (the so-called context). Then, using a mathematical equation 
that would probably take an entire ream of paper to write, the program deter-
mines the probability that the site is related to the words used most frequently 
on the site — the site’s keywords. (Smaller, common words, such as a, an, the, 
and, nor, or, but, and etc., are completely ignored by the crawler.)
Then the content on your site — broken down to the keyword level — is used 
to determine which ads are appropriate for your site. The keyword value — 
how much someone is willing to pay to have their related ad shown in your 
ad space — determines how valuable the ads for your site are to you, how 
appropriate they are, and how valuable they can be to your site visitors. Run 
a site that’s largely graphical in nature — lots of images, in other words — 
and Google has a hard time placing the right ads on the site. What you end 
up with instead are public service announcements, which are nice enough, 
I suppose — if you’re not interested in making money, because they take up 
space but generate no income.

41
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
My sense is that your interest in AdSense might be tied up with making a bit 
of green on the side. If that’s so, keep the following mantra in mind: “Content 
is a big deal. Content is king. Content is site traffic. Content is money in your 
pocket if it’s done right.” Content done right starts with building the right 
type of Web site.
If You Build a Content-Rich Web Site . . .
You probably already have a Web site to which you want to add AdSense — 
and that’s a good move. Honestly, any site that’s well designed can probably 
benefit from AdSense. If you’re just building your site for the first time, you 
can do a number of things to optimize your site so that you get the most from 
your AdSense investment.
The next few sections walk you through some optimization strategies 
designed to get your Web site working harder for you. I start out with some 
site-building basics and then move pretty quickly into some AdSense-specific 
recommendations.
 
Don’t think that all is lost just because your site exists already. Some of the 
optimization strategies I cover can be tweaked in ways that let you transform 
an already existing Web site into a site that gets more mileage from your 
AdSense efforts. A great idea, I’d say.
Site-building basics
Site design is critical to increasing your AdSense revenue. Both Google (the 
Brains Behind It All) and AdSense users (Average Janes and Joes working in 
the Web trenches) have tested different combinations of content, ad place-
ment, and ad design to see what works best. There are some clear leaders — 
site design is important, and it all starts with the site name.
Name and address, please
Okay, it’s time for the Obvious Tip of the Week: The name of your site should 
be closely related to the topic of your site. There’s also more to your name 
than just a name; a well-designed site has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) — 
fancy talk for a Web site address — that reflects the site name.
The URL is the address that you see in the address bar of a Web site. For 
example, you don’t want a Web site named TheKittenPalace.com if your 
target topic is dogs or tropical fish. If you look at Web sites, you’ll find that 
the content on the site is usually closely related to the site name.

42
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Domain names come in two flavors: free and premium (or not free). A free 
domain name is usually used with Web pages that are hosted in a Web site 
community, whereas a premium domain name is usually hosted all by itself. 
Think of domain names like a neighborhood. An apartment in a complex at the 
end of the street usually has to share the same address as several other apart-
ments (those in the same building), the only difference being the apartment 
number. Houses, on the other hand, have the luxury of their own address.
Free domains are available from a number of sources, including
 
 Google Pages: (www.pages.google.com): A free service you can use 
when you create your Web pages with Google Page Creator.
 
 Geocities: (http://geocities.yahoo.com): This free Web hosting 
provider has been around for a while. If you don’t mind someone else 
controlling the ads on your site, it’s a good option.
 
 Homestead: (www.homestead.com): Another free hosting provider, 
Homestead offers templates that make creating your Web site fast and easy.
 
 Free WebSites: (www.freewebsites.com): This service hosts your site 
for free, but requires that you allow them to advertise on your site. The 
ads are small, but you don’t control them.
Most of these services provide a Web page creator tool that lets you design 
your pages in minutes. You can literally sign up for an account and have a 
Web site online in less than an hour, and that’s if you’re being very creative 
about putting your site together.
The problem with pages like these — pages that are part of a community — is 
that you don’t have a direct URL. The URL for the site — which, if you remem-
ber my advice, should reflect the actual topic of your site — is usually some-
thing quite generic, like www.yoursite.community.com.
Nothing’s wrong with being generic — if you don’t mind ending up buried in 
search results — and nothing’s wrong with being buried in the search results 
if you don’t want to generate income with AdSense.
Oh, and one more thing. These pages are usually free because they’re pre-
loaded with advertisements from which you make no money. However, that 
would make it even harder for you to generate an AdSense income with these 
pages.
If you do want to generate income with AdSense, your Web site address 
should reflect your site name and it should be a direct address. A direct 
address states www.yoursite.com loud and clear and nothing else. I don’t know 
about you, but I’m much more likely to type that than to type http://www.
example1.com/ Search-Engine-Optimization /dp/0470175001/
ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208363273&sr=8-10 if I’m 
looking for a particular type of Web site.

43
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
Getting set up with a premium Web site that provides you with a direct 
address is a little more involved. You first have to purchase a domain name, 
which you can do from the following companies:
 
 GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com): Offers regular sales on domain names. 
You can also purchase your domain name, hosting, and other Web site 
services through GoDaddy.
 
 Register.com (www.register.com): Also offers domain names as well 
as hosting packages and other services. You can order domain names 
online through Register.com or by phone.
 
 NameSeek (www.nameseek.com): This company strictly sells domain 
names. It might even be more accurate to say this company negotiates 
the sale of domain names between current owner and purchaser.
After you have a domain name in hand, build the site and upload it to the 
Web. Many of the companies that sell you a domain name (or URL) will also 
offer to host your Web site for a monthly or yearly fee. (Hosting is like having 
land on which to put a house. You host your Web site on a server somewhere 
or on your own server.) You don’t have to host with the company you pur-
chased the domain name from, however. Any hosting company that you’re 
comfortable with will do.
What’s in a name?
The exception that proves the Name a Site 
in Accordance with the Site’s Content rule is 
when a personal name is also the name of the 
domain. For example, my personal Web site, 
JerriLedford.com, has a variety of information 
on it, all different types of articles and personal 
interests that I have. Over the past decade or 
so, the site has changed dramatically in design, 
but the variety of the content remains largely 
the same. This is because that’s the site I use to 
showcase (to editors) what type of work I can 
do. The goal of that site isn’t to sell a product 
but rather to sell a package — me.
JerriLedford.com does its job well, but it’s 
not the only dog I have in the World Wide 
Web race. Another site that I have is Google-
Geek.com, which I built for a very different 
purpose — to help people understand the dif-
ferent products and services that Google makes 
available. The site’s focal point is the Google 
Geek blog, but the site also has other pages 
that showcase different Google-related topics. 
Some are more in-depth articles about Google 
products and services, and a few are tutorials 
that guide users through using those products 
and services. The content of the entire site is 
focused on helping users use Google better. As 
you might expect, Google-Geek.com consis-
tently lands much better targeted AdSense ads 
than the content on the JerriLedford.com site.

44
Part I: AdSense Basics 
I use GoDaddy.com because their pricing for domain names is good and they 
offer the convenience of Web site hosting as well. However, you have plenty 
of options out there. Prices vary from one company to another, and what’s 
included with the domain name also varies. With some companies, you’re 
purchasing the name only. With others, you might be purchasing the name 
and security, the hosting, or any of a hundred or so other services.
Review each company to find the one that suits you and ask others what 
company they use. Find one that you like and then stay with it. That way, if 
you purchase multiple domain names, you can manage them all from one 
location. (For more on Web site hosting, check out the “Selecting the right 
Web host” section, later in this chapter.)
Getting with the plan
Before you register your site, put some thought into what you want the con-
tent of the site to be. In fact, it doesn’t hurt to write a short plan for the site. 
It doesn’t have to be a formal document, but getting your ideas on paper will 
help flesh them out and will also help you stay on track while you’re working 
through the site design and implementation. Some of the details to include in 
your plan are
 
 Site name: Remember, don’t get too cute, here. Make the name fit the site.
 
 Topic: You do know what your site will be about, right?
 
 Subtopics: Each of these will be a separate page or section of your site.
 
 Hosting: On what real estate will your site sit? You can use your own 
server or pay someone to host the site for you.
 
 Design: This includes the look of the site, the navigational structure, and 
even the kinds of images you want to include.
 
 Types of content: Will your site have only text, or will you also have 
video, audio, or downloads on the site?
 
 Special considerations: Do you plan to offer products for purchase? If 
so, include e-commerce capabilities.
You may think of other aspects of your site that you want to address in your 
site plan. If so, by all means, add them. Write it all down in as cohesive a 
format as you can and then put it away for a day or two. Come back to it after 
it’s had time to season a little and re-read your plan to see if it’s still as good 
an idea as you thought to start with.
Selecting the right Web host
Web sites need a place to park. Like the land your house or apartment sits 
on, a Web host is the physical place on a network where the files that make 
up your Web site are stored. This physical place has an address (the URL) 
that makes it possible for people to find the Web site, like a street address.

45
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
When you’re looking at Web hosting, the whole idea of parking your Web site 
somewhere can get a little complicated. How much space and bandwidth do 
you need? What about things like managing the domain, security, and having 
an e-mail address to go along with the domain? These are all aspects you 
should consider when examining your Web site hosting options.
In most cases, a domain hosting company has several tiers of hosting pack-
ages. The basic package usually gets you enough space on the server to 
house a few dozen pages of text and light graphics. You may even be able to 
slide a video or two into the mix.
From there, packages get progressively more involved until you have every 
service imaginable for your Web site, from e-commerce and content manage-
ment to download capabilities and streaming audio and video. What’s right 
for you is determined by your needs, and you can always start with a smaller 
package and increase hosting capabilities if you find you need them at some 
later date.
 
One thing to keep in mind when you’re selecting your Web host is the way in 
which your Web site will be designed, technically speaking. If you’re writing 
your site from scratch with HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or some 
other programming language, you have less to worry about. But if you’re 
using an HTML editing program (like FrontPage or DreamWeaver) to design 
your Web site, you may need to have special extensions installed on your 
site to allow file transfers from your computer to the server. These additional 
extensions usually add a few dollars extra to the cost of the hosting package. 
Knowing what you need before you get started could save you a few head-
aches and maybe even a little money.
Smart site design
After you come up with a name for your site and figure out where it’ll be 
hosted, it’s time to begin actually designing your Web site. You can deploy a 
few strategies that will make it easier to optimize your Web site for AdSense 
purposes.
First and foremost, keep in mind that the layout of your site will dramatically 
affect how your AdSense ads perform. This ain’t rocket science, by the way. All 
you really have to do is picture what most people do when they surf the Web. 
In general, a user nearly always uses a Web site in the same fashion. When a 
user clicks into your site, his eyes first take in the heading of the page, travel 
down the right side of the page, and finally move to the middle. The exception 
to the normal state of affairs is when there’s something flashy in the middle of 
the page that catches the visitor’s eye first. The left side of the page is where 
most Web sites include the navigational structure, so users are less inclined to 
look there until they’re ready to move on to another page on the site.

46
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
In Web site design, flashy isn’t usually a good thing. Neither is Flash-y. Flash is 
a Web design protocol that animates objects and allows designers to embed 
video into a Web page. The problem with Flash is that it tends to hog a lot of 
resources, so it slows users’ computer performance down, which users hate. 
The fastest way to lose visitors is to bog their systems down with your Flash 
(or flash). Make your pages attractive, but also make it possible for those 
pages to load quickly even with (gasp) dialup service.
Because visitors nearly always approach a Web site in the same way, many 
designers have discovered that the most important information on a Web site 
should go in certain places. That’s why you often see that Web sites have a 
navigation bar on the left side of the page. Some sites include text links at the 
top of the page, and the most important content on the page is nearly always 
above the fold.
 
Above the fold is a newspaper term used to designate the placement of the 
most important story in the day’s news. Newspapers are folded about halfway 
down the page. When a reader picks up the paper, she always turns it so the 
title of the paper is on top. (This is human nature; we don’t like things dis-
played upside down.) So, the most important story of the day gets in the top 
half of the page, above the fold.
The same term can be used to relate to Web sites as well, though the orien-
tation is a bit different. Because no fold is on a Web page, you have to think 
in terms of a browser window. Essentially, the fold on a Web page lines up 
with the bottom edge of your browser before the page has been scrolled. 
(Scrolling a page involves using the page’s scroll bars to move the page up 
and down so you can view content that’s not visible when the page appears 
in your browser window.)
Figure 3-1 illustrates where the fold is on the page. The figure also includes 
labeling for other important elements of the page.
A site visitor clicks your page and, in many cases, makes a determination 
about the value of the page before he ever scrolls down or moves the page in 
any way. Essentially, you have only one shot to make a good first impression: 
Whatever a visitor sees when that browser window loads is, for all intents 
and purposes, what he gets. So, the most important elements of your site 
should be loaded into that area above the fold. Information that’s not quite as 
important should be placed below the fold.
For your AdSense strategy, this means placing ads smack dab in those sec-
tions of your site where a visitor’s eye is most likely to land, which are
 
 At or near the top of the page (either immediately above or immedi-
ately below the title of the site, depending on how well the ads integrate 
in that spot)

47
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
 
 Above the content, or at the least, imbedded in the content above the 
fold
 
 On the right side of the page, blended with the other content that usu-
ally appears in the sidebar
 
 On the left side and the bottom of a page (only effective when the ads 
blend well with the other elements of those sections)
Figure 3-2 shows one of the most popular (and most effective) ad layouts.
While you’re designing your pages, keep in mind that the areas shown in 
Figure 3-2 are most desirable for ad placement. That doesn’t mean that ads 
should dominate those sections or that ads can’t be effective anywhere else. 
It only means those sections are optimal for ads. Also, ads should be inte-
grated into the content in those sections without being overpowering, and 
they should logically fit with your Web site design.

AdSense optimized content
I spend a lot of time in this chapter talking about ad placement for a simple 
reason — it’s important. If nobody sees your AdSense ad, it’d be like the 
proverbial tree falling in the middle of the forest — no moneymaking proposi-
tion, in other words.
With the ad placement basics out of the way, it’s time to figure out how to 
convince the good folks at Google AdSense to place ads on your Web site 
that have meaning to your site visitors. Your ultimate goal by implement-
ing AdSense is to entice visitors to click or view the ads that appear on your 
page. That only happens, though, if the ads are appealing to visitors. Having 
the right content is the key to having the right ads.
The technology behind Google AdSense — Web crawlers, spyders, and bots 
diligently scouring the World Wide Web for info — tries its best to determine 
the content of your site, but it ain’t perfect. If all the articles on one page 
refer to grading diamonds and other gemstones, the ads that are pushed to 
your page for display will (more likely than not) feature loose diamonds and 
gemstones or diamond and gemstone jewelry. (Duh!) If you have a thing for 
free association so that articles on any given page jump from one topic to 
another with no cohesion, AdSense will have a much harder time placing rel-
evant ads on your page. You could end up with ads for frog food when your 
site is related to planning a wedding at the lake. Try to keep your page as 
cohesive as possible and don’t combine topics on a page if you can help it.

49
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
 
Google uses the same technology to index your pages for search results that 
it uses to examine your pages to determine the most relevant ads. To improve 
ad targeting for your site, you can do some things that are designed to pique 
the interest of the Google indexers, like using keywords in your content and in 
the design of your site.
Piquing the interest of Google indexers has become a science in its own 
right — the science of search engine optimization. SEO, as it is referred to 
by those in the know, has tried to come up with a set of Web design prin-
ciples that deal with everything from choosing content to actual structure to 
help search engines more easily analyze your site to determine where in the 
search results it fits best.
One of the most basic elements of SEO is how the content on your site is 
formatted. Assuming your content is mostly text, the titles and headings of 
your text are important. Including keywords — words that indicate the topic 
of your site — in titles and headings as well as a few times in the text of the 
articles you’re using, is one way to ensure that a search engine crawler will 
properly classify your site.
Wanted: Good writers for Web site startup
You don’t need a degree or any other fancy 
identifier to ensure that you have good content. 
You don’t even have to be a writer, although it 
helps. There are all kinds of ways to find the right 
content for your Web site. If you don’t want to 
write the content, try using a content provider, 
such as EzineArticles.com, FreeSticky.com, or 
ArticleGeek.com. Dozens of other services are 
also available. A quick Web search will turn up 
more places that offer free articles than there 
are cars in Detroit. One problem with these 
sites though is that the content is often over-
used and stale. Remember that original content 
means better ads.
Another great option for having the right content 
on your site is to hire a writer. Online services, 
such as Elance.com, allow you to create a proj-
ect listing that available writers bid on. You then 
determine the winning bid. It doesn’t have to be 
the lowest bid, either. You determine what looks 
like the best bid with your own factors.
With a service like Elance.com, you or the writer 
pays a fee for the ability to list a project that is 
then bid on. Someone has to pay Elance’s bills. 
The fee isn’t unreasonable, and in fact, it’s more 
than worth it to many Web site owners that 
need original content.
If the whole bidding scene doesn’t paint your 
wagon red, you can also place advertisements 
for writers on Web sites, such as WritersWeekly.
com, Craigslist.com, or JournalismJobs.com. 
Some of these Web sites charge a fee for list-
ing your call for writers.
One thing to remember when you’re looking for 
a writer is that you often get exactly what you 
pay for. A writer willing to work for pennies is 
probably new and untested, which isn’t to say 
he’s not a great writer, just that you’re taking a 
gamble. Be willing to pay a little more to get a 
professional to write your articles, and always 
check references and provide a written con-
tract before you enter into any business rela-
tionship with writers or any other vendors.

50
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
The most important principle behind SEO involves making sure that you 
design your Web site so that it’s both useful and relevant to visitors. Site visi-
tors will come to your site either by conducting a search for a specific topic 
or by directly typing your Web address into the address bar of their browser. 
If you design your Web site with the intent of providing something the visitor 
needs, search crawlers are more likely to classify your site properly. As an 
added bonus, you’ll probably also end up ranking higher in the search results.
I have lots more on SEO in Chapter 4, but for now, the most you need to know 
is that if you apply the same techniques that you would to optimizing your 
Web site for search engines, your AdSense ads will be spot on.
In Figure 3-3, you can see how content can be placed around AdSense ad 
units to provide users with what they need and to feed the Google crawler so 
that ads are properly targeted.

You may say it’s just not enough to be told that the Google crawler knows 
its stuff when it comes to pushing content-specific ads to your site. It may 
not even be the content that you’re worried about. The big questions for you 
might be “Where will the ad lead?” or “How will it look after you put it on your 
site?” Sometimes you just want to see for yourself, and that’s fine. Just don’t 
make the mistake of clicking your own ads. Instead, use the AdSense preview 
tool to see what kind of ads will be returned for your site. (You can download 
the preview tool at https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/

these steps to download and install it:

Section targeting
In AdSense terminology, section targeting is a method of ad placement that 
allows advertisers to decide where on a page they want their ads displayed. If 
it turns out that you have ad space available in that place on the page, and if 
your page is related to the topic of the ad, the ad can be placed on your site. 
(I use can be because you probably won’t be the only publisher that meets 
the requirements the advertiser sets forth, and the ad can be placed on any 
site that meets said requirements.)
 
Ads rotate, so an ad may appear on your site one day and not the next. 
Advertisers’ budgets also vary, and that’s another determining factor on 
where and how often you may see the ad.

52

Figure 3-5:

You’ll encounter two types of section targeting:
 
 Contextual: Uses such factors as keyword analysis, word frequency, font 
size, and the overall link structure of the Web site to determine what a 
Web page is about and to precisely match ads to each page.
 
 Placement: Advertisers choose specific ad placements — sections of 
specific Web sites they’ve take a shine to — on which to run their ads. 
Ads that are placement-targeted may not exactly jive with the content of 
your page, but they’re hand-picked by advertisers who believe there’s 
a match between what your users are interested in and what the adver-
tiser is advertising. For the privilege of making these specific choices, 
the advertiser pays a slightly higher fee. As a publisher, you benefit 
because you’ll be paid every time someone comes to your site and sees 
the ad rather than by the number of times the ad is clicked.
Using RSS feeds for content
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a way of delivering news stories, articles, 
blog entries, and other types of content to subscribers by way of an e-mail or 
a content aggregator — a program that collects RSS feeds and delivers them 
all to a single location.
Think of RSS like a newspaper delivered to your home. You don’t have to 
go out to get every single story in a newspaper. You subscribe to the paper, 
the reporters do all the legwork, the publisher puts all their stories together 

53
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
in one package, and a delivery guy brings it right to your front door. An RSS 
feed is an electronic version of a newspaper.
The most important aspect of RSS feeds is that they deliver fresh content as 
often as it’s available. If you’re trying to put fresh content on your Web site 
to improve your AdSense revenues, that’s huge. It’s more content, less work, 
and Google loves it.
 
Wait. I can hear your objection. It’s not plagiarism or copyright infringement. 
Content owners who put their content out via RSS feeds want that content to 
be distributed to as many readers as possible. You still need to ensure that 
the content is attributed properly, but as long as you do, you should have no 
problem using RSS feeds to add content to your Web site.
You do have to consider a couple logistical problems when using RSS, 
though. One problem is that RSS feeds don’t always deliver full articles. The 
content owner — the person or company that publishes the article, news 
story, blog, or other type of content — can set how much of his content he 
wants delivered through the RSS feed. That means you may only get about 
250 characters delivered (which is usually about a paragraph). Some RSS 
feeds (the Google Reader, for example) link the titles of feeds to a pop-up 
window. When you click the title, the window pops up for you to read the 
feed. Because the bots and spyders Google uses won’t be doing that clicking, 
they probably can’t associate the RSS content with your Web site.
 
The way feeds are displayed varies from reader to reader. What’s more, the 
feed display (or a feed reader) isn’t likely to be customizable, adding yet 
another wrinkle to your plan to let someone else do all the hard work.
If you’ve embedded an RSS feed on your Web site to help generate fresh, new 
content, having only 250 words of an article can be a real problem because 
it’s hard to place relevant AdSense ads around that content. Even when the 
full article is available, feed readers often interfere with AdSense displays, 
making it difficult, if not impossible, to use RSS for content for your Web site. 
Back to the drawing board, right? Nope, not yet.
One way to get around those display issues is to use an RSS script that allows 
you to add the feed to your site and to change the way it’s displayed. RSS 
scripts, such as the RSS Equalizer (http://milleniumb.rssalizer.
hop.clickbank.net), CaRP (www.geckotribe.com/rss/carp), and 
FeedForAll.com’s PHP script (www.feedforall.com/free-php-script.
htm), make it possible for you to grab RSS content and display it more effec-
tively on your Web site. For example, if the script converts your RSS feeds to 
HTML, you can add articles to your site without ever even logging on. And 
best of all, you can also place AdSense ads around and within those articles. 
So now you not only have automatically updated content, but you also have 
content with AdSense ads. Life’s good!

54
Part I: AdSense Basics 
A word about “baiting”
If you’ve read a bit about Web marketing here and there, you may have come 
across link baiting. Link baiting is the creation of an article that’s so unique 
or interesting that people, because of its content, want to link to it. Link bait-
ing can be a good tactic for driving content to your site, which of course, will 
drive up your AdSense revenues. But to be successful, you have to make your 
link bait fun, informative, or creative — and it still has to be quality content.
The link bait has a dark side, too. When content is gimmicky, misleading, and 
unrelated to the content of your Web site, it can get you into trouble with 
Google. For example, if you place a gadget on a page of your site with the spe-
cific intent of drawing users to your site, and that gadget isn’t directly related 
to the site’s content, you’re skirting on the dark side of link baiting. Users 
may come to download that gadget, but they’ll be disgusted that your site 
isn’t relevant to their real interests, so they’ll go somewhere else.
After a while, even Google’s crawlers will realize that the increase in traffic to 
your site is only superficial. After they do, your ranking in search results will 
be penalized and your site traffic will drop dramatically. Misleading link bait-
ing is expressly forbidden by Google, and because it’s become such a popular 
way to drive Web site traffic, Google has developed some new ways to judge 
whether you’re using link baiting tactics.
Nothing’s wrong with adding a bit of fun or creative content to your site, just 
make sure you create it within the guidelines that Google has established. 
(Need a refresher on Google’s guidelines? You’re in luck. That section is 
coming up right . . . now!)
Understanding Google’s 
Webmaster Guidelines
Google seems to have guidelines for everything, and Web site design is no 
exception. Google’s Webmaster Guidelines (which I cover in some detail in 
Chapter 2) are the de facto guidelines for how any Web site associated with 
Google should be designed.
Google is certainly one of the most visible companies in the world. The 
number of people who watch Google in hopes that it will one day screw up is 
shadowed only by the number of people who are watching Microsoft hoping 
for the same. And because Google is such a target, the company needs to 
ensure that anyone who’s even very remotely associated with it meets cer-
tain guidelines to help avoid the ire of an offended public.

55
 Chapter 3: Building a Content-Rich Web Site
The Google Webmaster Guidelines are only one step in the requirements that 
Google has for people, but the guidelines are an important step — and it’ll 
benefit you to understand them completely. Here’s a quick overview, but take 
the time to read the complete guidelines at www.google.com/webmasters 
as the ideas underpinning them are valuable for Web design even if you’re not 
planning to use AdSense or any of Google’s other applications:
 
 Make your site easy to navigate by creating a consistent navigational 
structure across your site and by making that navigational structure 
obvious to visitors. Nothing’s worse than getting stuck on a Web page 
without a link to the home page or another way off the page without 
using your back button or closing your browser completely.
 
 Include relevant links to other Web sites.
 
 Use a site map (a text document that links to every page on the site) 
and submit it to Google. To submit your site map, you have to be a 
member of Google’s Webmaster Central, but signing up for that is as 
easy as signing up for any other Google account. After you sign up, 
submit your site map by using the form. (You can find links to the forms 
as well as other pertinent info at www.google.com/webmasters/
start.)
 
 Include clear, relevant content.
 
 Make sure the HTML that makes up your site is written correctly.
 
 Repair broken links as soon as they’re noticed.
 
 Allow crawlers access to your Web site by including a robots.txt file in 
the design of your site. The robots.txt file has two lines:
User agent: *
Disallow: /
 
 Create the file with a text editor, such as Notepad, save it using robots.
txt, and then when you upload your Web site to a server, be sure to 
also upload this file. The file tells Web site crawlers that they’re 
welcome to look at all the pages on your Web site.
 
 Design your pages for users, not for search engines. Users come to your 
site because they need something. Design your site so that the visitors 
you’re targeting get exactly what they need — information and products 
that they’re searching for. By designing your site with your visitors in 
mind, you’ll automatically hit most of the requirements that search engines 
have for ranking you in search results. A good rule of thumb is the more 
useful your site is to real people, the better crawlers will rank the site.
 
 Avoid any kind of underhanded Web site design, such as using hidden 
pages or hidden text that’s only meant to be seen by Web crawlers. 
Believe it or not, crawlers recognize this kind of sneaky design, and 
you’ll be penalized in search rankings for it.

56
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
 Use only relevant keywords in the titles, headings, and text of your 
Web site. (You’ll also be using them in your HTML code, but more about 
that is in Chapter 4.)
Many more guidelines are in the document, but these basics are a good place 
to start. And one in particular really sums up the whole concept of Google’s 
Webmaster Guidelines: Build your site for people, not for search engines. If you 
do that, the chances that you’ll end up in trouble with Google (or AdSense) are 
very slim. 
A word (or two) about extreme content Web sites
When you hear extreme content, visions of 
something less than moral — or worse, less 
than legal — may come into your head. I under-
stand the associations such a term may call up, 
but in the AdSense context, extreme content 
isn’t adult content, graphic violence, or even 
anything terribly controversial. Extreme con-
tent refers to large Web sites with thousands 
of pages of content — as many as 300,000 
pages!
Web site owners build extreme content sites 
specifically to increase the real estate on which 
they can place AdSense ads. The content is 
gathered from all over the Web; wherever the 
owner can find free content, she’ll grab it and 
sometimes she’ll even grab content that’s not 
free and, by extension, not for use by whomever 
wants it.
The problem with extreme content sites is that 
they’re built only for the ads, not for the users. 
And that makes it taboo if you’re really look-
ing to create a decent recurring income with 
AdSense.
AdSense doesn’t look kindly on Web sites that 
are built specifically to maximize AdSense 
income without any thought of the user in 
mind — and that’s exactly what extreme content 
sites are. Still, if you spend any time at all build-
ing your AdSense business, you’ll find someone 
online that tells you extreme content Web sites 
are the golden ticket. Don’t believe them.
Navigating through such a large site is nearly 
impossible, and the organization for and man-
agement of such a site is a nightmare. It’s time-
consuming and costly to create and maintain 
such a site, and when the Google crawler real-
izes what you’re up to, your site will be penal-
ized. You can even be banned from the AdSense 
program for using this kind of scheme to gener-
ate income.
Ultimately, it’s much better to design a Web 
site that users will want to use. Include the 
information that visitors are looking for, and not 
only will your Web site rank better in search 
results but your AdSense income will be higher 
because your ads will be much more relevant 
to the people who are visiting your site. You 
also won’t run the risk of being banned from 
AdSense, which would mean no income at all. 
It’s really not worth the risk for the short term 
jump in revenues, so don’t bother.

Your AdSense income is affected by many different factors, including 
how much advertisers are willing to pay for ads and how much Google 
decides to take for its trouble. As for factors that you, as an AdSense user, 
can actually affect, site design, of all things, is probably the most important 
because the design of your site affects the way that search engines rank the 
site in search results. The higher your site ranks, the more traffic that hits 
your Web site, which means (potentially) more AdSense income.
Traffic translates into page views, and page views translate into clicks of your 
AdSense ads. The more clicks you get, the better your income. Naturally, you 
want to do everything you can to increase traffic to your site. Search engine 
optimization is your first step. Ensure that your site is optimized for search 
engines, and the traffic on your Web site will increase dramatically as your 
search engine rankings rise.
People search for stuff all the time — that’s just what people do. We want informa-
tion, and in the 21st century, the fastest way to find information is to go to a search 
engine. Now, if you have a Web site, you want those folks looking for pertinent info 
to be directed straight to your Web site rather than that other guy’s Web site one 
domain block over. You want your site to rank well in search engines — in other 
words, search engines like Google. In fact, ranking well in search engines is so 
important that Web site owners are willing to pay thousands of dollars each year 
to ensure their sites rank as high as possible. Search marketing — the practice of 
creating marketing targeted at getting your Web site listed high enough in search 
engine rankings that it’s noticed by people — is a $12 billion a year industry and is 
one of the fastest growing marketing segments out there.

58
Part I: AdSense Basics 
The way you optimize your Web site so that it’s easier to find online is search 
engine optimization (SEO). Go figure. It’s kinda obvious, isn’t it? Where it 
begins to look a little muddy is in defining what, exactly, is the best strategy 
to adopt when optimizing a Web site. I’m here to tell you, though, that even 
if the topic is a bit muddy, you can still follow a few guidelines — guidelines 
that make a big difference in where your site ranks in search results. The rest 
of this chapter lays out a few of these SEO truths in all their glory.
Optimizing Your Site for Search Engines
Search engine optimization is a lot like trying to catch the steam that you 
breathe on a cold winter day. You can see it. You know it exists, but there’s 
no way to actually contain and quantify the steam. You can see the results 
of SEO and you can figure out how best to achieve it, but it’s still possible to 
do everything right and not achieve the ultimate goal — landing the very first 
listing on a search engine results page, or SERP.
Good news though, you don’t necessarily want to be the very top listing on a 
SERP. Think about this — how often do you click the first search result and 
not go any farther? Even if you find exactly what you’re looking for on the 
first page you jump to, you still click through some of the other results just 
to make sure the first page isn’t lying to you.
As a general rule, I go through the listings of about ten results pages, just to 
make sure I’m getting the best info. Admittedly, I may be a little more patient 
than your average searcher. Most people don’t go much deeper than the 
second page of results. Because you should probably be targeting your Web 
site to normal folks rather than obsessive-compulsive types like me, you want 
your Web site to fall somewhere on the first or second page of results. If it 
does, you’re fine — you can count your search marketing efforts a success, 
even if your site isn’t at the very tippy-top of the first SERP.
Achieving that first- or second-page placement isn’t a sure thing — it requires 
a little effort on your part. You can take a number of steps to ensure a better 
search engine ranking — steps I get to in a bit — but the most important 
piece in your SEO puzzle involves the keywords on which your Web site is 
based. You do have keywords, right? If not, you need them. However, not just 
any keyword will do, which the next section makes clear.
A Keyword By Any Other Name
It doesn’t matter what you call it, a keyword will always be . . . well, a key 
word or phrase around which your Web site content is centralized. A single 
word is sometimes not enough to narrow the possibilities for a Web site, 

59
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
which is why some keywords are actually keyword phrases or keyphrases. It’s 
the same concept — a centralized theme — just using more than one word. I 
use the term keyword generically to mean both keywords and keyphrases.
Web crawlers are programs that travel around the Internet examining and cate-
gorizing Web pages by keyword. That’s how search engines, like Google, know to 
return your Web site when someone searches for a specific keyword or phrase. 
The crawler has already had a look-see and has placed your Web page into a 
category along with all the other sites on the Web that fit into that category.
Keyword marketing, then, is using that keyword or phrase to market your Web 
site. Advertisements for a Web site, product, or service are designed using the 
keyword or keyphrase as the “foundation” for the ads. Then, when Internet 
users search for that keyword, the ads are displayed in the search results. 
Google then takes this process one step further by placing ads on Web pages 
that are built around — or optimized for — that keyword. So, whoever said a 
picture is worth a thousand words didn’t realize the Internet would come along 
and reduce that value to just one or two — three at the most.
Understanding Keyword Marketing
Before finding out how keywords work, you first need a quick overview of how 
Web sites are cataloged and then returned as search results. The way things 
go, you first put up a Web site. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy — maybe 
it’s your personal blog about your busybody Aunt Louise and how crazy she 
makes you, or it could be a serious site about how frogs hibernate in the muck 
at the bottom of ponds during winter. The topic of your Web site doesn’t 
matter, but you have to get it on the Internet.
After you put up a Web site, a search crawler — a specialized software program 
that examines Web sites and categorizes them by keyword — finds your Web 
site. Search crawlers are designed to crawl every Web site within parameters 
that are outlined by the search crawler’s designer. A designer could order a 
search crawler to, say, examine Web sites contained on a list drawn by the 
designer.
The crawler’s first stop is the first Web page of the first Web site on the 
designer’s list. The crawler reads through the pages of the Web site, looking 
at each word on the site.
 
Crawlers also look at what words are used together. For example, cosmetic 
makeup is different from exam makeup, but the crawler knows that makeup 
is used in two completely different ways because it looks at the words surround-
ing it.
While the crawler makes its way through a site, it records the number of times a 
keyword, a keyphrase, or a set of keywords is used on the site. If exam makeup is 

60
Part I: AdSense Basics 
used in the title and then three times in a 300-word section of text, it’s probably 
a good bet that the Web site being crawled is about makeup exams. Of course, 
the search engine crawler isn’t betting on anything. The crawler’s like the skep-
tic who doesn’t count on anything that’s not immediately visible and physically 
touchable. Exam makeup may be there, but it needs proof!
The crawler uses a very lengthy and complicated algorithm as its search 
formula. The algorithm compares the number of times a keyword is used to 
indicators that tell it if that keyword is important on the Web site. Like color 
coding, that algorithm makes it possible to define a Web site in terms of how 
it relates to a specific topic.
 
Algorithms in general are computer programs that systematically solve prob-
lems such as determining how many times a keyword is used on a Web site. 
They’re complicated creatures, highly technical in nature, and they are a 
search engine’s lifeblood — which is why they’re so jealously guarded. Just 
try to pry Google’s secret algorithm from their tightly clenched fist and see 
where that gets you.
The crawler takes a stab at what your Web site’s all about by registering the 
site’s keywords. The crawler then takes another look at the site, this time 
considering those keywords in the context of the Web site — not just the key-
words but also things like keyword placement (where on the site the words 
appear), the alternative text you put in for graphics (the stuff that shows up 
if the graphic won’t load), and the links into and out of the Web site.
After looking at all these elements and many others (some search engines 
use over 100 different considerations), the crawler makes a determination 
about where in the great scheme of things a particular Web site belongs. 
That information is then stored in a database the size of Manhattan.
Okay, it’s not really the size of Manhattan, but it’s huge. Way larger than any 
database you’ve ever encountered before.
After the Web site’s cataloged, it can be pushed to visitors that do a search 
based on keywords related to the main keyword of the Web page. That’s 
another algorithm altogether. That algorithm cross-references the search 
that a user makes with the data stored in the database to determine which 
sites — of the billions of cataloged sites — are the best fit for the keyword 
or phrase that the searcher used.
In other words, your Web site basically boils down to the keywords on which 
it’s built. To rank successfully in any search engine, you not only need the 
right keywords but you also need keywords that are closely associated with 
the topic of your Web site. Those keywords also need to be at the right 
places on your Web site. If they’re not, the search crawler won’t feel com-
pletely confident about which particular section of the database is the proper 
home for your site — so the site might be put lower in the rankings behind 
many other (perhaps far less relevant) sites.

61
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
Choosing the right keywords
Choosing the right keywords is a bit of a science — but it’s also a bit of old-
fashioned luck. No keyword guide is out there for the perplexed that can 
tell you whether the keyword is perfect for this or that subject. Instead, the 
words that apply to your subject are what they are. So, the best place to start 
looking for the right keywords for your topic is to brainstorm all the words 
that are most prevalent when the topic is in discussion.
Use search engine optimization (SEO) as an example. In any conversation you 
ever have about SEO, you’ll hear the term keyword come up time and again. 
Keyword is clearly one of the top keywords for SEO — come on, SEO is built 
around keyword marketing!
Okay, that was the easy part. Getting the number-one keyword down is like 
shooting fish in a barrel, but you can’t stop there. You need a larger pool of 
keywords to get you started. If you keep brainstorming additional words, 
you’ll probably come up with the following keywords:
Search engine
Search
Marketing
List
Link
Linking strategy
Alt tags
Metatags
Metadata
Media
Content
Social media
That’s just the short list. If you really put some time into brainstorming the 
SEO topic, you could come up with a couple hundred words. And don’t forget 
phrases, too — up to three words. They’re more useful and help you target 
better than just single words.
You’ll find hundreds of words for your own Web site topic, too. Sit down with 
a pen and a piece of paper and think through your topic. Write down all the 
words that come to mind as you consider each aspect of your business. Don’t 
worry about compartmentalizing the words, just get them on paper. When 
you’re done, cover up the page and walk away for half a day or so.

62
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
Walking away gives the list time to rest. Take the time away from the list to do 
something completely unassociated with determining keywords. During that 
time, try to keep your mind off the list so that when you come back to it, you 
can look at it with fresh eyes.
When you do return to the list, read through it slowly and take the time to con-
sider each word while you read it. Ask if a particular word is really a term that 
a searcher would use to find your Web site or a page on your site. If the answer 
is a resounding “No,” cross the word off the list. When you’re done, you should 
have a reasonably sized list from which to choose that magic number of words.
So, what’s the magic number? Who knows? Just use exactly the number of 
words you need (to market your site properly) and not one more. Here are 
some general rules you should follow:
 
 Start with a list of 50–100 keywords. You won’t use all the keywords, 
but the list gives you a good point from which to narrow the words that 
are most likely used to find your Web site.
 
 Don’t use more than three words on a single page. Also, only use three 
words if they’re all contained within a phrase. It’s better to use one word 
or phrase per page on your Web site, but each page can have a different 
word or phrase.
 
 Avoid words that are overused. Overused words are obvious search 
terms, but they’re also the most competitive terms and can cost a fortune 
if you’re targeting them for advertisements. No kidding. It’s not unheard of 
for some words to cost as much as $50 per click to advertisers who want 
their ads prominently displayed if someone searches for that keyword. 
Advertisers would have to have an endless budget to market with these 
words. On the other side of that equation is AdSense — which arranges to 
display those superexpensive ads on Web sites like your own — and yes, 
those words pay really well, but the competition for sites to place those 
ads on is also very tough. Best to stick with something that will get you a 
regular listing of some great ads that will truly interest your visitors.
 
 Try to think like site visitors think. What keywords represent your 
visitors’ interests? One way to keep up with this information is to use a 
Web site analytics program, such as Google Analytics (www.google.
com/analytics). An analytics program tracks visitors to your site, such 
as where they came to your site from and what keywords they used to 
find your site on search engines, along with many other statistics. If you 
don’t have a Web site analytics program, get one. Right now.
After you narrow down your keyword list, put in the hard work — research 
the words on the list. Researching keywords isn’t difficult, but it can be 
time-consuming. That’s one of the reasons you don’t want to start the pro-
cess with a list of 500 potential keywords. You’d never have enough time to 
research them all. It’s also unwise to use too many keywords on your Web 
site because it makes it hard for crawlers to properly classify your site — a 
problem that could leave you without well-targeted AdSense ads.

63
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
The first step in researching keywords is to select the top 20 or so words or 
phrases that most accurately reflect your Web site. Then, with that list, start 
searching for each word or phrase on the list.
Look through the first couple results pages for matches to your site. Do the 
pages returned by your search engine reflect the content of your site in any 
way? If not, how do the sites that do get returned differ from yours? Are they 
structured differently, for example? If you examine your results critically, you 
can find clues that help you decide how well the word or phrase you selected 
will actually result in traffic to your site.
The next step is to look at statistics, such as the amount of competition and 
the cost of advertisements for the keyword or phrase. Keyword research 
tools like the Google AdWords Keyword Tool (https://adwords.google.
com/select/KeywordToolExternal) and the Yahoo! Search Marketing 
Keyword Tool (http://pixelfast.com/overture can help here). You 
must have a Yahoo! Search Marketing account to use the Yahoo! tool, and 
while I write this, Yahoo! Search Marketing is still under construction, but 
should be up and running soon.
The Google AdWords Keyword Tool performs two functions: It allows you to see 
what other keywords you might be missing when putting together your keyword 
list and it also lets you see which of those keywords are most valuable to you as 
a publisher. The Keyword Tool is easy enough to get the hang of. At first glance, 
it may look like it’s just a generator for keyword ideas, but as you dig deeper into 
using it, you can learn valuable facts about keywords, such as how much com-
petition there is for a keyword, what kind of placement an advertiser can expect 
for ads targeting that keyword, and what the search volume is for the keyword. 
Here’s how a typical keyword search using the Keyword Tool works:
 
1. Point your browser to https://adwords.google.com/select/
KeywordToolExternal.
 
2. Under the How Would You Like to Generate Keyword Ideas? heading, 
select the Descriptive Words or Phrases radio button.
 
3. Enter a few keywords from your list into the center text box, as shown 
in Figure 4-1, and then click Get Keyword Ideas.
 
 After a few seconds (the exact time depends on the number of words 
you enter), the suggested keywords appear beneath the search box, as 
shown in Figure 4-2.
 
 The default information shown includes the Advertiser Competition 
(how many advertisers are bidding on that keyword), the previous 
month’s Search Volume (how often that keyword was searched for in 
the past month), and the Avg Search Volume. (The average is figured 
monthly, based on the number of searches each month for the past 
year.) Each statistic is represented by a colored bar, representative of 
what you see in a bar graph. The more color in the bar, the greater the 
competition or volume.

Enter keywords here.
 
 The average cost of a keyword to the advertiser doesn’t appear auto-
matically, but you can change the way the keywords are filtered (see 
Figure 4-2) with the Filter drop-down menu.
 
4. To determine the average cost of a keyword, choose Show Estimated 
Avg. CPC from the Filter drop-down menu.
 
 The CPC, or cost-per-click, is the amount that it costs an advertiser every 
time one of their ads based on that keyword is clicked. That amount is 
paid to Google, which then distributes portions of the money to AdSense 
publishers that allow those ads to be shown on their Web sites. Of 
course, Google keeps a fair chunk of it to line its own pockets, too.
 
 After you make your selection from the Filter drop-down menu, another

 The keyword list changes slightly, and a new column appears with the 
estimated average cost-per-click (CPC) for each keyword suggested, 
as shown in Figure 4-4. Now you not only see the competition for the 
keyword or phrase, but you also see what it costs advertisers who use 
those words. Only a percentage of that is paid to publishers (you) who 
show the ads, but this gives you an idea of how valuable your available 
ad space is, based on the keywords you use on your Web site.

Understanding and optimizing click-through-rates
The more traffic you have on your Web site, 
the higher your click-through-rate (CTR) will 
be. Click-through-rate is exactly what it sounds 
like — the rate at which your site visitors click 
through the ads that you display. This rate is 
based on the number of visitors to your site 
versus the number of visitors who click your 
AdSense ads.
What’s considered a good CTR is a hard figure 
to nail down. It’s against Google’s policies for 
publishers to publicly discuss the results they 
have with the AdSense program. So, despite 
the fact that you may have seen discussions 
about it on the Internet, you should avoid fol-
lowing suit. Still, it helps to have a general idea 
of what you can expect.
The rates I’ve heard all hover around the 2–4 
percent range. That’s 2–4 percent of your total 
traffic who actually click through the ads on 
your Web site. If you get 100 visitors per day, 
with these percentages, two to four of those 
visitors will click through your AdSense ads, 
generating money for you.
The thing to remember is that those numbers 
are in no way official or accurate. They’re 
whispers heard and accurate only to the spe-
cific cases (and circumstances) in which they 
actually happened. A wide variety of factors 
can affect your CTR, from placement of the ads 
and the amount of traffic on your Web site to 
the mood of site visitors in a given day and the 
colors of the ads themselves.
All these factors are variables that change 
often. To further cloud the picture, fluctuations 
in the popularity of certain keywords, changes 
in the budgets of advertisers, and the ways in 
which those advertisers choose to write their 
ads have to be considered.
To some extent, your click-through-rate is 
dependent upon the advertiser. If the advertiser 
isn’t doing his homework and properly target-
ing his ads, your click-through-rates could be 
affected because the ads won’t appeal to your 
site visitors.

67
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
  
 Because you’re researching keywords for your Web site with AdSense 
income in mind, use a high figure for your maximum CPC, like $50 per 
click. This really doesn’t determine how much you make per click on 
advertisements that appear on your site, but it gives you an idea of 
which keywords you’ll be paid the most for. In keyword marketing, the 
advertiser pays a fee to display ads. How much they pay for that privi-
lege directly affects how much you make. So, the more a keyword costs 
the advertiser, the more you’ll make as a publisher of those ads.
Keep in mind that whatever keywords you choose should be used intelligently 
on your Web page. If you include the keywords but don’t use them properly, 
you’ll do yourself more harm than good by causing inappropriate ads to 
appear or by causing Google to disqualify your site from the AdSense program 
for not following proper Web design practices. More information about Web 
design practices can be found in Chapter 3, and I address how to properly use 
keywords on your Web pages in the next few sections, so keep reading.
The importance of keyword placement
After you finish researching your keywords and then selecting the most 
valuable — those worth most to your pocketbook — and the most appropriate 
words for your Web site, you have to actually integrate them into your Web 
site. Using those valuable and appropriate keywords in your site’s content is 
good practice, and more information about how to use those words in your 
content is in the section “It’s all about placement,” later in this chapter, or you 
can flip back to Chapter 3 for even more Web design help. But there’s more to 
keyword placement than just putting the words into the content on the page, 
as the next few sections make clear.
Placing keywords in site design
Face it: You don’t need much of the old gray matter to place keywords in 
prominent places in the content of your Web site. Stick them in a title, a few 
headings, or the opening paragraph and voilà — you’ve placed your key-
words. The thing is, if any idiot can do it, many will; which means that all 
those Web sites with keywords prominently placed in the text start looking 
alike — at least to Web crawlers sent out by search engines. To make your 
site stand out, feature your keywords in the less-obvious corners of your 
Web site, such as places that may never be seen by Web site visitors but are 
visited by Web crawlers. “Where are these dark corners?” you ask. Read on 
to discover the hidden mysteries of Web site design.
When you’re designing your Web site, there are places under the hood — in 
the actual HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structure of the site, in other 
words — that you can use as hidden storage areas for placing informational 
tidbits about your site. Because all this stuff is information about your Web 
site content — information about your information, in other words — such 
tidbits are referred to as metadata, or data about your data. Metadata is 

68
Part I: AdSense Basics 
placed within special HTML tags (dubbed, curiously enough, metatags) within 
the code for a Web site that search engine crawlers then read when catalog-
ing your site for inclusion in search results. As such, you’d be smart to stuff 
your metatags with as many keywords as your HTML structure will bear.
Metatags where keywords should appear include the following:
 
 Title metatags
 
 Description metatags
 
 Keyword metatags
 
 Heading metatags
 
 Alt text
Now, for those of you out there who are faint-of-heart when it comes to HTML 
coding, be aware that you need to physically place these metatags (with the 
exception of the alt text) in the top section of the HTML code of your Web 
page, between the tags that indicate the head of your page. Figure 4-5 shows 
part of the raw HTML code for the Google Geek Web site, including the head 
tag, metatags, and body tag.
As I mention earlier, metadata are usually indicated within the HTML of your 
Web site as metatags. The code here shows how the metadata might appear 
on your site:
<Head>
<Title>Your Web Site Title Goes Here</Title>
<Meta name=”description” content=”Include a quick keyword-
rich blurb about your site here.”>
<Meta name=”keywords” content=”enter keywords here, 
separated by commas”>
</Head>
 
Figure 4-5: 
Metatags 
should be 
placed in 
the HTML 
header of a 
Web site.
 
Metadata tags

69
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
The head tags usually have far more information between them because this 
is where the heading of your Web site is set up. Information about the colors, 
images , and styles of the page are also included here, but those don’t really 
concern you when you’re thinking about keywords. Those elements are all 
associated with site design, not keyword placement.
Working with alt text
Another area in which you can place your keywords is the alt text on your page. 
Alt text is the alternative text that’s used to describe images on your page to 
search engines and to site visitors who can’t view the images. This alt text is usu-
ally included in the image tag in your page’s HTML and looks something like this:
<img src=”imagefilename.jpg” alt=”keyword descriptor”>
Alt text should be limited to as few effective words as possible. So, if the 
image on your Web site is a magnifying glass, the alt text might simply be 
search if that’s one of your keywords.
Adding keywords to the HTML descriptors on your Web site is far from a difficult 
task. When you know where to put the keywords, it takes little time to do it. If 
you’re writing your Web site code from scratch, you can insert your keywords 
in the appropriate places while you write it. If you’re using an HTML editor or a 
WYSIWYG — what you see is what you get — Web site design program, you can 
switch to the HTML view for the HTML editor and add the tags that way.
The extra effort improves the search engine rankings for your site and ulti-
mately makes it easier for Google to find the right AdSense ads to appear on 
your site. The tags also help to ensure that ads appearing on your site are 
targeted to the correct audience — assuming that the keywords you’re using 
are well targeted.
The secret of keyword density
If you’ve been following along in this chapter so far, you’ve already found 
out that your chosen keywords need to appear somewhere in your content. 
(D’oh!) Clearly, your Web site articles and other elements (stuff like video 
content) should be targeting the topics your potential visitors are searching 
for — which means your articles and other elements will have your keywords 
embedded in them somewhere.
That’s pretty much a no-brainer. But if you take this a little bit further, it gets 
a bit more interesting. Some folks might be tempted to adopt what I call an 
in for a penny, in for a pound strategy — if a little bit of something is a good 
thing, a lot of something is a very good thing. Why settle for a sprinkling of 
keywords on your Web site when, with a little bit of effort, you can saturate 
your Web site with a veritable blizzard of keywords?

70
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Why indeed? Because if you yield to temptation, you’re guilty of commit-
ting keyword spam, the act of deploying your keywords merely to increase 
search engine results placement (bad!) rather than using them to provide site 
visitors with desired information (good!). No one likes spam. You don’t like 
spam, your potential Web visitors don’t like spam, and even spammers don’t 
like spam. Keyword spam doesn’t even help you increase your search engine 
results placement. In fact, Web crawlers that recognize keyword spam can 
get your number and list your site deeper in search results, or worse, com-
pletely de-list your site from those results.
The secret to having the right balance of keywords in your site content is 
keyword density — the ratio of keyword occurrences to the overall number 
of words used on your site. Search engines vary on what’s acceptable for a 
keyword density. Google, for example, looks for a keyword density of around 
2 percent, whereas Yahoo! and MSN look for a keyword density closer to 5 
percent. Remember, these are guidelines. So, if your keyword density is less 
than 5 percent, your page will still appear in Yahoo! and MSN search results. 
But over 2 percent and you might be penalized by Google.
 
Most folks who do search engine optimization for a living tend to stay around 
the 2 percent keyword density mark to stay in Google’s good graces.
Time to picture what a 2 percent keyword density might actually look like. 
Think of it this way: If the page contains an article that’s 1,000 words in 
length, your selected keyword or phrase should appear no more than 20 
times in the article. Twenty seems like a small number until you start adding 
keywords to articles and then you find that it takes some serious work to 
spin 1,000 words around one word or phrase and still have everything make 
sense and not sound repetitive.
The key here is to build an article around a specific topic, like “credit moni-
toring,” but then not to go overboard using the keyword or term — which in 
this case is “credit monitoring.” The article should be a coherent information 
piece, and the use of the keyword or phrase will automatically grow out of 
that. You just have to be careful not to stuff that keyword or phrase into the 
article out of context in a misguided attempt to use your selected keyword as 
often as possible.
One trick that might help, though, involves thinking outside your body text 
box. It turns out that putting keywords into the body text of your article is 
only half the work when you’re dealing with keywords. Keywords should also 
appear in the title and the headings of articles you place on your Web site. 
Titles and headings are also given additional weight in search engine rank-
ings because those are the elements on a page that catch a visitor’s eye.
Think of it as being like reading a newspaper. Most people scan a page of the 
newspaper before committing to reading any of it. They look at headlines, 
paragraph headings, and bold or italicized text before they decide which 

71
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
stories to read. Reading behavior is the same online — someone clicks onto 
your page, scans the titles, headings, and specially formatted sections of the 
articles there, and then decides to read deeper or click away.
Keywords in your titles and headings help pull readers into the content of the 
article and help search crawlers classify your site by those keywords. See, 
search crawlers are designed to weigh the appearance of keywords in certain 
places — like titles and headings — just like people do. It’s written into their 
programming, so you might think of a search crawler as the ultimate reader.
The Magic of Linking Well
Search engine optimization plays a key role in generating AdSense income 
because how well your Web site places in search results determines how 
much traffic your site sees. If you plan to have AdSense ads on your site and 
you hope to generate a decent revenue stream with them, having a well-
optimized site is essential. And part of site optimization is having a linking 
structure — the links that connect the pages of your site together as well as 
the links that connect your page to other pages on the Web — that leads to 
other, complementary sites as well as having other sites link to you. Like key-
word placement, link management is almost as much of an art form as it is a 
strategy.
Linking schemes
Linking schemes are nothing more than the structure of how your Web site 
is linked to other sites, how other sites are linked to you, and where inter-
nal links lead. Good Web design principles include all three types of linking 
schemes, and all are important to search engines because what a search 
crawler is looking for is site usability first — how easy it is for visitors to go 
from one place to the next on your Web site — and then site relevancy, or 
how appropriate your site is to the topic for which a site visitor is searching. 
Crawlers literally follow all the links on a Web page to make sure that what’s 
connected together makes sense and is useful in the context of where the 
links appear both in text and in navigational menus.
 
When you’re creating your linking schemes, remember that the ultimate goal 
is to make your site as usable and as valuable as possible to your site visi-
tors. Assume that your visitors have landed on your page because it contains 
information for which they’re searching; the idea here is to make your site as 
valuable to those visitors as possible by providing your visitors with the info 
they’re looking for and then some. (It’s the and then some that keeps them 
coming back for more.)

72
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Creating value for your user encompasses one concept — provide the user 
the information he seeks. It’s that simple. That doesn’t mean that you need to 
have every detail or product related to a specific topic on your site. But if you 
don’t have it and you don’t plan to put it there, at least be prepared to point 
visitors to another site that does have the information or products sought.
All of that is accomplished through linking. You’re either linking to another 
page on your site where the information being sought is available or you’re 
linking to another site entirely. In return, you should also have other sites 
linking to your own, for the same reasons. (I have some tips on how to get 
other sites to link back to you later in the chapter.)
Internal linking
Internal linking is the process by which the pages on your site are actu-
ally linked together. The type of links isn’t nearly as important as the way 
in which the pages are linked, but even the structure can have some ben-
efits. For example, text links — called hotlinks — can be more valuable than 
graphic links because they allow you to use your keywords within the link. 
But it’s also important to have a consistent navigational structure — the links 
that usually grace the side or top of a page that lead to different sections of 
your Web site. Both hotlinks and navigational links can be used in your inter-
nal linking process.
Using keywords in your navigational structure gives you freebie opportuni-
ties to use them — the keywords within links don’t count toward the key-
word density of a page because the percentage of times a keyword is used is 
based solely on the content on the page. This means you can use your key-
words more often. But using hotlinks does count toward keyword density, so 
be careful about how you place those links.
It’s also important that no matter how your links are formatted, you always 
need to leave an escape hatch — every page on the site has to have a clearly 
defined navigation area with easily recognizable links that make it a snap to 
return to whatever page the visitor wants. Users who click from one page to 
another in your Web site may not appreciate having to click the Back button 
to get them back to the page they were previously on. Even more impor-
tantly, if there’s no way for users to go back from whence they came, they’ll 
leave. Typical surfer behavior when they can’t escape a page is to close 
the window or browser that’s pointing to the site on which you have them 
trapped. They may also just type a new address in the browser bar and navi-
gate away from your page that way.
 
Internal links all qualify as navigational links, even when they include hotlinks. 
Use these links wisely, and always provide a way for users to navigate back 
the way they came. I don’t care whose fault it is; if you lock a visitor in Web 
page hell, she’ll leave and probably won’t come back.

73
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
It’s far better to have all your pages (even those that are unrelated) con-
nected in a loose kind of way. Every page should have a way to go back to 
the main page as well as a way for visitors to get back at least to the previ-
ous page if not to the beginning of a section. It may be that your navigational 
structure expands to show previous pages or sections of your Web site, 
based on where the visitor is on the site at any given moment. Whatever you 
choose to do, make sure visitors have plenty of ways out.
When you’re creating the way that your internal pages are linked, also remem-
ber to keep like pages grouped together. When you think of the structure of 
your Web site, think of it as a tree. The trunk of the tree is your main page, and 
each of the branches is a major topic. Subtopics are the smaller branches off 
the main branches, and the leaves are individual pages of information.
If you were to draw your Web site structure, it should resemble (in an 
abstract kind of way) a tree lying on its side, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Each different topic of content on your Web site should be related to the 
overall theme of the site — nobody would argue with that — but each topic 
should also be further broken down into smaller categories so that site visi-
tors can quickly find what they’re looking for. For example, if your site is 
about healthy cooking, every page on your site should be related to healthy 
cooking. However, individual sections of your site can be broken down into 
the different types of dishes that you cook or the techniques that you use to 
create healthy dishes. Keep like content together and keep it all related to the 
main theme of the Web site.

Part I: AdSense Basics 
External linking
External linking — the links you use to connect your Web sites to other rel-
evant sites on the Web — is also going to play a major role in the way that 
your Web site is categorized by search engine crawlers. External links lead 
away from your page, and for this reason, many Web site designers think 
it’s best to avoid external links on a page. Not true. In fact, if you don’t have 
some element of external linking on your page, it becomes an obstacle in 
both search rankings and in helping potential visitors find the information 
they’re searching for.
Search crawlers look for external linking on a page as a sign of how well con-
nected the page is to the industry or category that it’s included in. For exam-
ple, if your site is about mental health issues, users will expect to find links 
to other sites on the same topic. Crawlers will too. And if a crawler examines 
your site and finds you’re not linked to other related sites, it devalues the 
site, assuming that the site will be less useful to site visitors (because no 
single site can have every piece of information about a topic or category).
What you don’t want to do is create a Web page that’s an island — surrounded 
by cyberspace, but cut off from everything. Even the most beautiful islands can 
become useless if nothing connects them to the rest of the world. And if your 
Web site isn’t connected to other Web sites, (especially where search crawlers 
are concerned), the usability rating of the site falls considerably.
It’s necessary to have outgoing and incoming external links to your site. But 
there’s a catch (isn’t there always?): The external links on your site should 
lead to or from other sites that are relevant to the content on your site. If 
you’re linking to other sites in some disorderly, couldn’t-figure-it-out-with-
a-clear-explanation kind of way, you might as well not have any links at all. 
Search crawlers follow every link leading out from your site and will evaluate 
the content on the linked site for relevancy. If the content doesn’t compute, 
your search rankings will plummet.
 
Having one or two links to unrelated sites isn’t a big worry. It’s not at all 
unusual for your best friend, who sells handmade soaps, to link to your Web 
site about money management. But if you want search engines to take notice 
of your Web site, I recommend that you have far more links to other sites 
related to money-management vehicles, tools, and information.
Reciprocal linking
One way to gather links to your site and to share your site with other rel-
evant Web sites is to use reciprocal linking. Reciprocal linking is the new-age 
version of you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours. You find sites that would be 
of interest to your site visitors and then approach the Web site owner with 
the offer of putting a link to her site on your own if she’ll do the same for you 
in exchange.

75
 Chapter 4: AdSense and Search Engine Optimization
It’s a good strategy to get some inbound links built into your site if it’s a new 
site, but don’t rely on this type of linking to gain you much favor with search 
crawlers. A limited amount of reciprocal linking is acceptable, but when a 
search engine is examining the links to your site, it ranks them by determin-
ing if the keywords used on your Web site are similar to the keywords on the 
sites that are linking to you. That’s why links always need to be generated 
out of true interest in the content on your site. If your link to another page 
is matched by a link back to your own page on too many pages, the value of 
those links is lessened because the pattern of “I’ll link to you if you link to 
me” becomes obvious.
Think about the wildly popular Web sites in your business (or personal) 
scope. Even better than just thinking about it, surf on over there and have a 
look. Click through a few of the external links on the page and look at where 
they lead. Are there links back to the page you just left? In most cases, the 
answer to that will likely be “No” because the most popular pages on the 
Web don’t need reciprocal linking schemes. People link to them all the time 
because the site offers information that’s of interest to everyone concerned 
with that topic.
It’s all about placement
One last strategy to extend your linking mileage: Where you place your links 
matters. When a crawler is navigating through your site, it’s looking at the 
usability of your site. So, if you’re hiding links in places that users can’t find 
them simply to improve your Web site ranking, you’ll find your Web site in 
search results’ nether regions. And yes, that’s a trick some Web site design-
ers really use. The idea behind hidden links is to have them there because 
you must have that linking structure, but to have the links hidden in places 
users don’t think to click so they won’t navigate away from your Web site. 
Wrong move. That kind of linking strategy will turn the curious search 
crawler into a snotty search crawler that doesn’t score your Web site well for 
ranking purposes.
 
Keep in mind that hidden links are very different from strategies like using 
metadata keywords, as I talk about earlier in this chapter. Metadata keywords 
and tags are built into the structure of your site and are designed to provide 
additional information to crawlers. Hidden links and keywords are actually built 
into the visitor-facing structure or user interface. Hidden links and keywords, 
however, are intentionally blended into the site so that visitors can’t see them. 
This is a deceptive way to include elements of Web design that crawlers look for 
but that a Web site owner might not want the site visitor to see.
Creating a well-designed site that uses a more traditional link placement 
structure is much better. Not only are Web surfers accustomed to seeing a 
navigation structure, or links, in a few places (the top of the page, the left 
side of the page, or within the text), but a well-designed site meets a need — 

76
Part I: AdSense Basics 
the visitor’s need for information. By meeting that need, you give visitors a 
reason to return to your site again and again.
Most often on a well-designed site, some combination of those navigation 
structures is going on. Most Web sites have their main navigation bar on the 
left side of the page, and users know that that’s where they can usually go 
to find the link to the next page within the site. Links to other sites can be 
included in the text or in combination with the navigational structure on the 
sides of the page.
Once in a while, a page will have the main navigational structure on the right. 
In fact, that’s a common structure in blogs, and there’s nothing wrong with 
setting up your page that way. Web crawlers don’t give a hoot if your navi-
gational structure and other links are located on one side of the page or the 
other. But it’s important that however you decide to do it on the main page 
of your Web site, you maintain that structure across every other page on the 
site. Users get frustrated if the navigation scheme changes on every single 
page, and Web crawlers will notice the inconsistency and lower the usability 
ranking of your site.
Keyword marketing is like watching the news. A big story could hit today, and 
it might hang around for a few days until journalists have wrung all the interest 
out of the story. Then something else happens, and those same journalists toss 
that story aside in favor of the newer, more interesting piece of news.
With keyword marketing, marketers might be willing to fight hard to win 
the bids on one keyword today, only to find that another keyword is much 
more popular and worth more to them in advertisements tomorrow. These 
changes affect the income that you make from each click through, as well as 
affecting the click throughs themselves. When the higher-paying marketer 
moves on, it opens a keyword for lower-paying advertisers. Sometimes, 
though, those lower-paying advertisers aren’t writing ads that are as appeal-
ing to your users.
Users’ moods change, too. What they’re interested in today will certainly not 
be the same tomorrow or next week. So, to keep your CTR optimized, you 
have to stay on top of your keywords. Watch the effectiveness of the key-
words around which your Web site is built. And don’t be afraid to test new 
and different keywords, especially if your traffic statistics begin to fall. Your 
AdSense income depends on you staying at the razor’s edge of the marketing 
curve. And that requires attention from you.

O
ne reason many people shy away from using AdSense on their Web 
sites is because they think that the whole AdSense thing is just too 
hard to manage. Surely there has to be some trick to adding AdSense to your 
Web site — a trick that only some uber-geek could figure out.
Nope. If I can figure it out, just about anyone can. I’m a consumer technologist — 
I can tell you all about why you should use a program and how that program 
works. If you want me to program the program though, you’re looking at the 
wrong gal. Programmer, I am not, and that includes HTML.
That didn’t make a bit of difference when it came time to put the AdSense 
code on my site. I did it, and it wasn’t that hard and didn’t leave me wonder-
ing what in the world I was doing wrong. You won’t have any problems either 
because it’s a cut-and-paste job. The catch is that you have to know where to 
paste the code that Google provides for you.
Choosing AdSense for Content 
or AdSense for Search
I make putting the code on your Web site sound really easy because it is. Before 
you get to the whole cut-and-paste part, you’d best understand a few things 
about AdSense ads, and it’s these facets of the ads that can be confusing.

First of all, you have to decide whether you’ll use AdSense for Content or 
AdSense for Search. (I don’t talk too much about AdSense Referrals, Video 
Units, or AdSense for Mobile, just yet. Those capabilities are discussed in 
Part III.) To make the decision, you need to know how the two differ, so here 
goes: The difference between AdSense for Content and AdSense for Search lies 
in how your ads are displayed.
 
 AdSense for Content displays linked ads — ads that contain links that 
lead to the advertisers’ Web sites — in text or graphical formats on your 
pages.
 
 AdSense for Search displays a search box on your Web site that site 
visitors can use to search for additional information if they don’t find 
what they need on your pages.
 
 Figure 5-1 shows an AdSense for Content ad and an AdSense for Search 
ad side by side.
AdSense for Search is a tough sell. Not because it’s not useful. Many people 
like having the option of searching for what they need right from the page 
they’re on. However, the fact that it takes two clicks before you get paid 
turns a lot of folks off.
 
Figure 5-1:

Search is 
completely 
different from 
AdSense for 
Content.

Link Units: The Other AdSense 
for Content Ad
AdSense for Search ads are not the only AdSense ad type that requires two 
clicks. Link units, which are a subset of AdSense for Content, also require 
two clicks. Figure 5-2 shows you what I mean. Users click once on the link on 
your page, which takes them to a list of targeted advertisements that looks 
like a search results page (as shown in Figure 5-3). Users must then click one 
of those advertisements for you to get paid. The neat thing about this (when 
they’re used properly and work for you) is that often you can get paid for 
multiple ad clicks from one display because users will follow the initial link 
and then check out several of the ads on the results page.

Generating Search Box Code
Life doesn’t always demand stark choices. It’s not as if you can get only 
chocolate or vanilla ice cream. In fact, throw in strawberry, and you have 
Neapolitan, the ice cream for indecisive folks everywhere.

Part I: AdSense Basics 
The same principle applies to AdSense for Search versus AdSense for 
Content on your site — there’s no reason you can’t have both. AdSense for 
Content works well in and around your articles and other printed content, 
and an AdSense for Search box at the beginning of the page (or end of the 
page or in a blank space on the page) works pretty well, too. The results from 
the search box can add to your AdSense income; although if I were you, I 
wouldn’t rely on the search box alone to generate income for your site.
 
My advice to you: Go with a combination of both content ads and the 
search box.
With that out of the way, it’s time to do some code slinging. I start out with 
the AdSense for Search code, just because today is Tuesday. (I cover the 
AdSense for Content code later in this chapter.) Keep in mind, though, that all 
the AdSense ad formats are created in about the same way. You work through 
the wizard, copy the text, and paste it into the HTML on your Web site. Pretty 
simple, in other words. You’ll probably spend more time debating where to put 
your search box than you’ll spend actually dealing with the code.
 
You can install the search box wherever you have some blank real estate that 
you don’t plan to put higher paying ads or other content on. Some designers 
place their search box at the top of the page, others at the bottom. Very few 
actually use a search box in the center of the page or off to either the right or 
the left because the box looks awkward and out of place in those locations. Site 
visitors usually look to the top or bottom of the page if they want to search.
To create a search box for your Web site:
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com, log on to your AdSense 
account, and click the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. In the Setup tab, select the AdSense for Search option.
 
 Doing so calls up the AdSense for Search Wizard.
 
3. On the top of the first wizard page, as shown in Figure 5-4, select 
either the Google WebSearch option or the Google WebSearch + 
SiteSearch option.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Choose 
the type of

create at the

81
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
 
 WebSearch allows visitors to search the Web for additional information 
whereas WebSearch + SiteSearch allows users to search up to three Web 
sites that you specify in addition to the whole Web.
 
4. If you select WebSearch + SiteSearch, a new form appears in the 
wizard, as shown in Figure 5-5. Fill in the Web addresses of the sites 
you wish to allow visitors to search in the appropriate text boxes.
 
 If you select WebSearch, you can skip to Step 5.
 
 In most cases, those sites will be your own sites, but you can select any 
sites you like. You also don’t have to enter three sites — one or two are 
fine if that’s your preference.
 
5. Scroll down to the middle of the page, as shown in Figure 5-6, and 
then choose your search box style.
 
 Each of the options has a preview that appears when you select that 
option. You can choose to move the Google logo above the search box, 
or to remove it completely and place it on the search button. Another 
available option is to move the search button down below the text field 
of the search box.

82
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
 Next to the search box style you’ll find options to change the back-
ground color, text color, and allowable text length of the box. Feel free 
to select the options that work best with your Web site.
 
6. From the drop-down menus at the bottom of the wizard page, select 
the default language for search results. (See Figure 5-7.)
 
 There are 30 — count ’em, 30 — options besides English.
 
7. Choose the type of page encoding that your Web site uses from the 
options in the drop-down menu provided. (Refer to Figure 5-7.)
 
 The type of encoding that your site uses depends on how it’s designed. 
If you don’t know what type of encoding your site uses, check with your 
Web site designer. The most common encoding used for Web sites 
is UTF-8, but Western (Windows 1252) is another common encoding 
format.
 
8. In the final drop-down menu on the wizard page, select the country 
you’re in so Google knows which domain to search from. After you 
make your selection, click the Continue button.
 
 The second page of the wizard appears where you have a chance to cus-
tomize your search results page.
 
9. Use the Palettes drop-down menu (see Figure 5-8) to select a different 
palette for your various color needs, or click the small, colored box 
next to each element of the search box — Text, Background, Border, 
and so on — to create a custom palette.
 
 If that’s still not good enough for you, you can always enter the six-
digit, hexadecimal number in the text box provided for each element. 
By the way, don’t let the term hexadecimal scare you; it’s just a number 
that represents the color you want to use. A nifty sidebar in Chapter 7 
explains colors and hexadecimal numbers in more depth.

10. If desired, use the logo customization tools shown in Figure 5-9 to 
upload a personalized logo to your search results page.
 
 It’s easy to do, enter the URL showing where your logo is located on 
your Web site. If you’re not certain of that URL, right-click the logo in 
your browser and select Copy Link Location. Then, paste that link loca-
tion into the Logo Image URL box, and AdSense pulls your URL when-
ever a search results page is shown. After you enter the location of the 
logo, the preview display changes to reflect the logo you want to use.
 
 The second text box, Logo Destination URL, is there so that you can 
make the logo on your search results page a link back to your Web site if 
you like. To do that, enter the URL of your Web site — or whatever page 
you would like to send visitors to — in the provided text box.

11. In the More Options section, as shown in Figure 5-10, select whether 
you want the search results page to open in a different page or 
window, or to open in the same page by selecting the desired option.
 
 Opening the search results page in another window or page is best. That 
leaves your Web site open for visitors to return when they’re finished 
looking through search results. After all, the idea here is to give them 
additional tools to help them make better decisions about using your 
site, not to direct them away from your site (potentially) for good.
 
12. Decide whether you want to customize the type of search results with 
the help of the Site-Flavored Search option.
 
 Site-flavored search customizes search results over time to your topic 
and to your Web site visitors. It takes some time for the search results to 
become highly targeted because Google tracks which results are most 
clicked by site visitors that use the search box. Site-flavored search can 
add an additional element of functionality to your search capabilities, 
however, because it discovers how to provide the best possible results 
to your visitors. If this is an option that you want to use, select the 
Customize the Type of Search Results I Get to My Site Content check box.
 
 If you do choose this option, the site-flavored search options expand, as 
shown in Figure 5-11, so that you can select a profile to use to track the 
search results.
 
13. Use the drop-down menu provided to select the desired profile.
 
 There may be no profiles available to choose from if this is the first 
time you’ve selected this option. To create a profile, select the Add New 
Profile link. A text box appears where you can enter the name of the 
desired profile. When you’re finished, click OK and the profile is created.
 
14. If you want to protect visitors from being exposed to adult-themed search 
results, select the Use SafeSearch check box. (See Figure 5-10.)
 
 The SafeSearch option blocks adult content.

options for

ized search.
 
 
15. For the last option on this page, decide whether you want to use a 
custom channel to track your results.
 
 Custom channels are like Web counters. Each time a visitor uses a search 
box that you’ve assigned to a custom channel, the count for that visit is 
credited to that specific channel. Custom channels provide a way for 
you to keep track of which ads are successful and which ads get low 
amounts of traffic.
 
 You can choose to add a custom channel that separates this traffic from 
other AdSense traffic. To create a custom channel, click the Add New 
Channel link. This opens a dialog box where you type the name of the 
channel you want to use and then click OK. The channel is then auto-
matically set for you. If you already have an existing channel you want to 
add, select it from the drop-down menu.
 
16. When you finish customizing your search box and search attributes, 
click the Continue button.
 
 The final page of the wizard appears, containing the code for your 
search box in all its glory.
 
17. Copy and paste this code into the HTML of your Web site and you’re 
done.
 
 If you’re not sure where to paste it, keep reading. You can read more 
about code placement a little further along in this chapter in the section, 
“Code Placement for Optimum Traffic.
Now you have a search box for your Web site. Go ahead and try it, just to see 
if it works. Ain’t technology grand?
 
If you’re not generating any income from the search box, you can always 
remove the code after a few weeks of testing. With AdSense, testing is the key 
to finding what works for your Web site. Keep in mind that what works for you 
might not be the same thing that works for others. That doesn’t mean you 
should ignore what others have figured out; only that you shouldn’t be limited 
by others’ experiences.

86
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Understanding Ad Formats
If you’re not using search boxes on your site, you’re probably using AdSense 
for Content, and with content, creating the right ads gets a little trickier. 
Trickier, as in negotiating a strange house blindfolded — it’s pretty certain 
you’ll bump into things and your path won’t always be the most direct to 
your destination, but you’ll eventually end up in the right place through trial 
and error.
But that’s the worst-case scenario. Why go through all that trouble when you 
have someone who can take the blindfold off, let you see exactly where you 
are, and show you the path to exactly where you want to go? (Me, in other 
words.) When I get you to understand the ad formats in AdSense and under-
stand what works best where, it’s like taking off that blindfold.
The infinite variety of AdSense ads
AdSense gives you dozens of different types of ads and ad formats to choose 
from. Options include
 
 Text ads
 
 Image ads
 
 Video ads
 
 Link units
 
 Referral buttons
 
 Themed ads
Each of these categories includes 8 to 12 different sizes of ads, and then you 
can further customize ads by choosing the referral partners — the folks whose 
products or services you want to recommend to your Web site visitors — or 
the colors of the ads. There are enough choices to keep you busy testing differ-
ent types of ads for a couple years, at least!
Text ads
Text ads are the most popular type of AdSense ad. If you’ve seen a Web site 
using AdSense, you’ve seen text ads. It gets a little confusing, though, when 
you step back and try to determine exactly what kind of text ad would be 
best for what space on your Web site. Should you use a leaderboard ad or a 
medium rectangle? What’s the best placement for a vertical banner? When 
considering options on your Web page, you could probably come up with 
dozens of potential places for placing ads, but really knowing what works 
best — rather than just guessing — can be a little tricky.

87
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
Here’s where I come in. Table 5-1 shows you at a glance what types of text 
ads are available and what the best placements for those ads are. Note: The 
size of each ad format is noted in pixels (or the tiny little squares that make 
up online images). It’s not essential to know this, but I thought I’d mention it 
in case you were curious.

Obviously, you won’t use every single one of those ad types on your page. 
Instead, you should select two or three of the ads that seem to work best in 
the natural flow of your pages. For example, if you have a Web site that regu-
larly features articles about products or just provides information for site vis-
itors, it might be best for you to consider using a skyscraper ad — an ad that’s 
tall and narrow, just like a skyscraper — on the right side of the page and a 
rectangle ad — a shorter and wider fellow — at the beginning of an article.
The size of the ad and the size of the space that you have available for an ad 
determine which ones fit best where on your page. The first four ads in the 
table (leaderboard, banner, half banner, and button) are horizontally ori-
ented, as shown in Figure 5-12. Okay, so the button ad is squarer, but it fits 
really well in the screen shot.
The best places to put horizontally oriented ads are at the top of a page, 
between articles or blog entries, and sometimes at the bottom of the page. 
Don’t expect much by way of performance out of ads that you place on the 
bottom of the page. On rare occasions they do well, but for the most part, you 
want to remember the rule about keeping your ads above the fold of your page.

88
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
Figure 5-12: 
The leader- 
board, 
banner, half 
banner, and 
button ads 
are more 
horizontally 
oriented.
 
Remember, the fold is considered the bottom of the Web browser window. 
The idea is that you don’t want your visitors to have to scroll to see your ads 
because they’ll often only look at the top of the page without scrolling further 
down. If you need a refresher about the importance and function of the fold 
of the page, flip to Chapter 3. The exception to that fold rule is with a blog, 
where you can (somewhat successfully) place ads between blog posts.
Here’s my take on five of the most popular ad formats:
 
 Leaderboard: Probably the most successful format — so much so that 
you’re sure to have seen them everywhere. Publishers — that means 
you or anyone who signs up with AdSense and publishes ads to a Web 
site — usually put leaderboard ads at the top of the page because they 
fit nicely there. They’re designed to be about the same width as a Web 
page, and they can blend underneath the header of a page very well.
 
 Banner: I’d say banner ads are the least successful of the top five. That’s 
not to say banner ads won’t work at all. Your circumstances might 
make them work beautifully for you. However, site visitors tend to hate 
advertisements, and the banner ads of old are the reason. When Internet 
advertising first started to take off, banner ads were one of the first 
types of ads to appear — and they were a pain in the rear. Too often, 
early banner ads were graphically challenging to Web browsers, slowing 
users down when they went from one Web site to another. Back when 
dialup was the main way to access the internet, downloading anything 
with large graphics was a pain.
 
 Most Internet users today use broadband (you know, cable and DSL), 
but the bad taste left by those early banner ads still remains. Users can 
spot a banner ad, and out of sheer habit will usually avoid them like that 
smelly compost heap in the back corner of the yard.
 
 Another problem with banners is that they’re not the full width of your 
Web site, which leaves lots of open space on one side or the other of 
those ads. That’s another factor that makes them look like ads. People 
will click your ads, but only if they don’t glaringly look like ads.

89
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
 
 Half banners: Half as bad as banners, but that still doesn’t make them 
good — and they leave even more open space around them than 
banner ads.
 
 Vertical banners: Standing a banner upright doesn’t make it any less 
banner-ish, it just changes the orientation, but vertical banners still 
work on some Web sites in the right column. They’re more graphic than 
skyscraper ads, and are somewhat more acceptable than their horizon-
tal counterparts.
 
 Button: Useful little buggers for any small space that you have available. 
Usually, that small space falls in the sidebars of your pages, on the left and 
right sides, which is the best placement for those ads. If you have a small 
spot on your sidebar where your links don’t reach or there’s open, empty 
space, a small button ad fills that space nicely without being overbearing.
Okay, so that’s the top five. On to the next type of text ads from Table 5-1: 
the two vertical ads — the skyscraper and the wide skyscraper, as shown in 
Figure 5-13. (I treat them both at once.)
I think its okay to place vertical ads on either side of your Web page, right 
there in the sidebar area; but in my opinion, the wide skyscraper seems to 
do best on the right side of the page. Some experts suggest that could be 
because most visitors tend to be right-handed, and the right side of the page 
is technically closer to their hand, making it easier to click the ad. I’m not 
sure I buy that line of reasoning.
 
Figure 5-13: 
Skyscrapers 
and wide 
skyscrapers

cal ads you 
should use 
on the sides 
of your 
pages.
 

90
Part I: AdSense Basics 
I think it’s more accurate to say that the wide skyscraper on the right side of 
the page feels right. Flip back to where I talk about the way that users tend to 
view a Web site (Chapter 3, I believe). Users look first at the top of the page, 
and then at the right, and finally at the left side of the page. Only after glanc-
ing at those three areas do they look to the content in the middle of the page.
 
On the right side, the wide skyscraper just fits well. It looks like it belongs 
there, and that’s where users expect to see it. One key to success with any 
online endeavor, including with AdSense, is to meet the visitor in her comfort 
zone. It’s one reason that so many business people in the real world no longer 
do business in the office — business types go where their clients are most 
comfortable: the beach, a restaurant, Starbucks, or into the client’s home. 
Potential customers (which are what your Web site visitors are) are more 
likely to be agreeable to your terms or to purchase your product if they’re 
comfortable, so make them comfortable. Put the skyscrapers on the outer 
edges of the pages and use the wide skyscraper on the right.
Going down the list in Table 5-1, you see a set of square and rectangular ads, 
represented in living black and white in Figure 5-14.
The square and rectangle ads are the most versatile of the AdSense offerings. 
These ads do well when placed in text, as long as the text is wrapped around 
the ad, making it look like part of the article or blog post. Of the six ads 
shown in Figure 5-14, the large rectangle is usually the most successful when 
placed in text, with the medium rectangle being the next most successful.
The thing to remember about these ads, though, is that just because others 
find that one type of ad performs better over another in their case, the same 
might not hold true for you. Testing is the key to determining what your best 
choices are. Look at the space in which you plan to use the ads and then, 
based on the space that you have available, try a few different configurations.
If the traffic flow to your site is already established, testing each ad will prob-
ably only take about a week. Put up an ad, watch the numbers for a week, and 
then try something different for another week. After you test several differ-
ent configurations, you can tell what works well, what works great, and what 
doesn’t work at all. Remember though, the effectiveness of your ads could 
change over time and with changes to your site, so testing will likely be a 
constant process.
To make it easier to keep up with your results over time, write down every-
thing. Keep track of the dates, the ads and placements used, the format of the 
ads (colors and styles, in other words), and anything else that might be per-
tinent to the results that you see. After a while, you’ll instinctively know what 
will work on your site and what won’t. Until then, you have a written record 
to help you keep track.

provides.
 
Image ads
I have this feeling that image ads are what you probably think of when you 
think “Ah, yes, Web advertisements!” You have your nice image and your 
pithy text, just like the banner ads I mention earlier in the chapter. And, as 
is the case with banner ads, everyone has them and everyone ignores them. 
Does that mean you shouldn’t use image ads? Not necessarily. Just don’t 
expect them to generate as much income as text ads do.
Image ads include pictures or other images that can be very eye-catching, 
like the ad shown in Figure 5-15. No mistaking it for anything else; you know 
at a glance that it’s an ad.
Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong with visitors knowing that your ads 
are in fact, ads. Most users will recognize all kinds of AdSense ads for what 
they are. However, visitors really do tend to hold a grudge against image ads 
of all kinds, so the better you can blend them into the content of your site, 
the less likely they’ll be ignored.

92

Fortunately, there are several different sizes of image ads that you can add 
to your page. Table 5-2 gives you a quick overview of those sizes and how 
they’re best used. (If you notice some similarities with Table 5-1, your eyes 
aren’t playing a trick with you. The formats are pretty much the same.)

Image ads, like text ads, need to blend into the surrounding elements of your 
page as much as possible. You don’t want to make them invisible — if that’s 
your goal, you might as well not put any ads on your site. If you can make 
them appear as if they belong on your page, your site visitors will be less 
likely to shun them completely.
For horizontal placement, the leaderboard and banner ads are your best 
options. These ads, as shown in Figure 5-16, work well at the top of pages, 
usually directly below your page header, or between articles or blog posts.
The thing to remember with these horizontally oriented ads is that they have 
to be really great ads that work really well on your pages, or users will ignore 
them for the most part. It might take some tweaking to get the ad just right 
for your page. If you have a choice, text ads are probably the better option. 
Save the image ads for other areas on your Web site.

horizontal 
offerings for 
images.
 
The next set of image ads — the skyscrapers — are also likely to be ignored if 
not integrated well into your site. Such ads, as shown in Figure 5-17, are best 
suited to the edges (the right and left sidebars) of your pages. And much like 
the text ads, the wide skyscraper is always better suited to the right side of 
the page.
As for square and rectangular ads, they work best embedded in (or surrounded 
by) the text on your page. These ads, when placed in the text and matched to 
the color palette of your Web site, can actually look like they belong with the 
article or blog post. When they look like they belong, that’s when visitors’ old 
aversions to image ads are less likely to rear their ugly heads.

The square and rectangle ads you see in Figure 5-18 are the least evil of the 
image ads. Test a few of them in your text and see how they work for you. If 
they don’t do well, you can always switch back to text ads.
Video ads
Video ads are one of the newest additions to the AdSense family. Technically, 
though, the ad is not the video. Yes, videos are streamed for advertising 
partners that have YouTube accounts, but the actual ads are displayed in the 
video player that’s embedded in your content, not in the video itself. To see 
what I mean, check out Figure 5-19.
The formats available for video units include
 
 Leaderboard
 
 Skyscraper
 
 Wide skyscraper
 
 Small square
 
 Square
 
 Rectangle
 
 Large rectangle

Figure 5-19:

I won’t subject you to another table because the size and placement of these 
ads are the same as the size and placement of the image and text ads shown 
in the earlier tables in this chapter.
When a site visitor clicks the video player, the content from the advertiser’s 
YouTube account is shown, along with a link to his site. The video player also 
becomes a large graphical link when the video is finished playing.
For you to get paid, your site visitors must click through the video player to 
the advertiser’s site. It’d be nice if these types of ads were shown on an impres-
sion only basis — you’d get paid each time someone viewed the video — but 
that’s not the case. The click actually has to happen.
That doesn’t mean video ads aren’t good for your site. Today’s Internet users 
love video content. If the content of the video units on your site isn’t too 
advertise-y, you may find that these units are good for your AdSense income. 
Of course, that also depends on how well they work with your Web site con-
tent. Test them to see how they perform. If you don’t like the results, you can 
always go back to image or text ads.
Link units
Probably the second most used ad type in the AdSense program (after text 
ads) is the link unit. Link units are very cool because — when used properly — 
you can make them look like they belong on your page, so users are more likely 
to click them.

96
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Making a link unit look like it belongs on your page is pretty simple. You 
adjust the template colors of the ad to match the template colors of your 
page. Then, when the link units are displayed on your page, they look like 
links that are related to the content of the page.
Link units come in several sizes, as detailed in Table 5-3. (In the table, you 
see some ad sizes followed by the number 4. This indicates there are four 
links in that ad display. All others have five links displayed within the ad.)

Although there are several sizes of link units, there really are only two types — 
vertical and horizontal.
Vertical link units are best used in the sidebars of your page. Use them at 
the top or bottom, before or after any set of links that you might have in 
your sidebar. The ads, as shown in Figure 5-20, work well when matched or 
blended with your template colors. In essence, users think those links belong 
with the links surrounding them, and they’re more likely to click those ads 
than most other ads.
Several different sizes of vertical link units make it easier to integrate them 
into the sidebars on your Web site. When you tweak colors with the color 
pallets provided by Google, you can make them appear as if they’re an inten-
tional part of your site design.

97
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
 
Figure 5-20: 
Vertical link 
units look 
like lists of 
links that 
can be inte-
grated into 
existing link 
lists on 
your site.
 
The horizontally oriented link units, as shown in Figure 5-21, work essentially 
the same way — they just work better on the top and bottom of your pages, 
and between articles and blog posts. Like the vertically oriented link units, 
tweak the colors of these, and they’ll blend well on your Web site. The key is 
to make them look like they belong.
As with everything good, there has to be a catch. Link units are great to blend 
in with your Web site, and they look less like advertisements than anything 
that’s available in the AdSense program. But here’s the rub — with link units, 
site visitors have to click twice before you get paid. They must first click a 
link within the link unit, which takes them to a page that looks very much like 
a search results page. The real difference is that the results shown on the 
page that the link unit leads to are all advertisements. For you to get paid, 
users must click through one of the links on the results page.
 
Figure 5-21: 
Horizontal 
link units

98
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Here’s the trade-off, though. If users are inclined to click through the links 
on the results page, it’s also likely that they’ll click through more than one of 
those results, meaning you could get paid for more than one click.
With link units, they either work really well or they bomb completely. The 
only way to know is to test link units on your site and see how they perform 
for you. Try different configurations and locations. If they’re going to work, 
you’ll find your sweet spot. All you have to do is watch the change adding up.
Referral buttons
One last type of AdSense ad that you should consider is the referral button. 
These ads, shown in Figure 5-22, are small buttons that refer site visitors to a 
sponsored program.
 
Figure 5-22: 
Referral ads 
allow you to 
choose up 
to 15 com-
panies or 
products to 
endorse.
 
The ads shown in Figure 5-22 show specific types of programs, such as 
Google Pack, AdSense, and AdWords, but Google has referral buttons from 
hundreds of different advertisers that want you to endorse their products.
All the referral ads are basically the same, with the exception of the text link 
variety. The text link referral ad is literally a line of text that displays a refer-
ral. You can place this text link anywhere in your content. The remaining ads 
are all buttons of various sizes:

99
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
 
 120x240
 
 180x60
 
 468x60
 
 120x60
 
 125x125
 
 110x32
When you’re setting up your referral button ads, you can select up to 15 dif-
ferent ads to rotate through the referral button. So, if you choose to use a 
125x125 square referral button, you can have referrals from up to 15 different 
advertisers. That doesn’t mean you have to choose 15 companies to refer 
visitors to. You can select just 1, 5, or 12 if you like — whatever works best 
for your site.
 
As an added bonus, with referral button ads, you get to choose exactly the 
companies that you want to show referrals for. You’re not surprised by an ad 
from a competitor or a company you’re not willing to endorse.
When you’re making the selections for your referral ads, you can browse the 
different categories of vendors and even look at the products and URLs that 
you’ll be supporting. Referral values are also listed next to each product, so 
you’ll have a ballpark figure of how much you’re paid for each referral.
Themed ads
Themed units are basically text ads that have a specific theme. Google offers 
these around holiday times, and they just appear in your ad structure. You 
don’t have to do anything special to use themed units — they’re automati-
cally enabled in your ads when you set up your AdSense account.
You’ll find themes that surround the various major holidays on your calen-
dar. How themed ads work varies from the way that text ads work, however. 
The theme makes it obvious that an ad is an ad, unless you’ve changed your 
whole site to reflect the holiday theme.
If you’re into decorating for the holidays, you might consider using themed 
ad units. If your site stays the same (appearance-wise) day in and day out, it’s 
probably best if you just avoid the themed unit altogether.
If you decide you’d rather not have the themed advertisements showing on 
your Web site, you can disable themed ads (they’re enabled by default) using 
these steps:

100
Part I: AdSense Basics 
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com and log on to your AdSense 
account.
 
2. Click the My Account tab.
 
 You should be automatically taken to your Account Settings page. If not, 
click Account Settings in the link strip below the tabs.
 
3. Scroll down the page to the Ad Type Preference section, as shown 
in Figure 5-23, and then click the Edit link, next to the Ad Type 
Preference heading.
 
 You’re taken to the Ad Type Preference page.
 
4. On the Ad Type Preference page, as shown in Figure 5-24, select the 
Display Text Ads Only in All Ad Units option.
 
5. Click the Save Changes button.
That’s it. Themed ad units are disabled and won’t show during holiday 
periods. Of course, neither will any other kind of picture ad, so you have to 
decide whether you want text only or if you’re okay with themed units on 
occasion.

 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
 
With any of the AdSense formats, only half the art is knowing what ad to place 
where. The other half is knowing how to format your ads to make them more 
appealing to site visitors. Because the name of the game is garnering clicks 
on your ads, you want them to appeal to site visitors — the color, style, and 
placement should all entice the visitor to click the ad. So, there’s way more 
to it than just placement. The fine details make all the difference, and those 
details are covered in Chapter 7.
Generating Other Types of Ad Code
Okay, if you’ve followed along in this chapter, you now have a better grasp 
of the kinds of ad formats AdSense makes available to you. And, if you were 
really good and read the opening section in this chapter, you know all about 
generating the code for search boxes on your Web site. Generating the code 
for other types of AdSense ads works pretty much the same:
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com and log on to your AdSense 
account.
 
2. Select the AdSense Setup tab.
 
3. Choose the type of ad that you want to have on your site — content 
ads for text, search boxes to allow visitors to search, or video ads if 
you use video on your site.
 
4. Select the ad size you want to have displayed.
 
5. Customize the ad to work on your Web site, using the color and dis-
play customization options I show you in Chapters 3 and 4, as well as 
earlier in this chapter.
 
6. Select the channel — the tracking information — you want to use for 
the ad.
 
7. Click Submit and Get Code to generate the code for the ad.
 
8. After your code has been generated, copy and paste the ad code into 
the HTML on your Web site.
 
 Don’t worry if you’re not quite sure where to put the code. The next 
section, “Code Placement for Optimum Traffic,” contains all the details 
you need.
That’s it. The AdSense wizard walks you through making all the selections 
that you need to generate the code. Then all you have to do is copy and paste 
it into the HTML of your Web site. Of course, copying and pasting the code 
isn’t as easy as it sounds. If it were, there wouldn’t be a dozen or more books 
about improving your AdSense income.

102
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Code Placement for Optimum Traffic
You’re now in a position where you understand ad formats and you can gen-
erate the ad code. Does that mean you’re all set? Far from it. You still need to 
figure out precisely where to put all that nice HTML code you’ve just gener-
ated on your page and watch the dollars ad up.
In Chapter 2, I point you to the AdSense help pages for information on code 
placement. If you made your way through those pages, you may already know 
where to put your code, but if you’re like me, you haven’t made it over there 
yet, so you’re still clueless. No worries. I help you get up to speed right now.
Getting code where you want it
How you place the AdSense code on your site depends on how you’re access-
ing the HTML for your Web site. There are two basic ways to do it:
 
 Using a WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) HTML editor: If that’s 
your weapon of choice, be sure to switch from Design view to HTML 
view.
 
 Using an HTML Insert capability: If your Web site design software 
application offers an HTML Insert feature, all you have to do is paste the 
HTML into the window provided and click OK.
In both cases, when you view your Web site (or preview your Web site), the 
ad should appear. Of course, it’s a little more complicated than that because 
you need to know exactly where to paste the code.
If you’re using the HTML editor, you’ll have to navigate your way through 
your HTML code. One major landmark to look for involves the <body> tags 
on your Web site. You may remember from Chapter 4 that a very scaled 
down version of your HTML might look something like this:
<Head>
<Title>Your Web Site Title Goes Here</Title>
<Meta name=”description” content=”Include a quick keyword-
rich blurb about your site here.”>
<Meta name=”keywords” content=”enter keywords here, 
separated by commas”>
</Head>

103
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
After the heading of your Web site comes the body. That looks like this:
<HTML>
<Head>
<Title>Your Web Site Title Goes Here</Title>
</Head>
<Body>
The body of your Web site goes here.>
</Body>
It’s between those body tags that the code for your AdSense ads should be 
placed. If the code doesn’t appear between those body tags, the ads won’t 
show up on your Web site.
Now, if you go back and look at the source code for any given Web site 
(remember, you do this by choosing View➪Source or View➪View Source Web 
from your browser’s main menu), you see that there’s a whole lot of gobble-
dygook between the body tags. Basically everything that you see on your site 
below the header and above the footer will appear in there somewhere.
Knowing where in that jumble of code to paste your AdSense code makes 
all the difference in the world. It takes a little bit of trial and error to get the 
code in the right place if you’re not an HTML guru.
If you read through the HTML (don’t panic, after you focus on it for a few 
minutes, you begin to see the patterns that translate into a Web site), you’ll 
start to see common tags, like <div> (which means division) and <table> 
(which indicates the beginning of a table).
As you begin to see the patterns in your code, you also begin to recognize 
where you want to paste the code. For example, if you’re pasting the code 
for a leaderboard-sized link unit into your page, you want to paste it immedi-
ately following the opening body tag (<body>). This ensures that the ad gets 
placed at the top of the page.
To paste a rectangle text ad into the beginning of an article, paste it immedi-
ately before the first word of the article. And if you want to place an ad in a 
sidebar, place it after the division tag for the sidebar.
It’s only slightly different if you’re using a Web design program that allows you 
to insert snippets of HTML into your site design. If that’s the kind of program 
you’re using, place your cursor or pointer at the place on the page where you 
want the HTML snippet to appear, and then select the HTML Insert command 
from the main menu. In the window that appears, paste in the code and then 
click OK. You can then drag or resize the section that contains the HTML code 
until it’s in the exact location where you want it displayed.

104
Part I: AdSense Basics 
When installing the HTML code onto your site, remember that location is 
everything. Review the placements that I share with you earlier in the chap-
ter and try them to see how they work for you. Of course, don’t let those 
guidelines become your prison, either. Test different sizes, colors, and loca-
tions until you find the combination that suits your site the best and draws 
the most clicks.
Resisting the urge to change the code
When you’re installing your AdSense code, one of the most important things 
to remember is that you can’t change the AdSense code in any way. You 
can’t add to it, take away from it, or otherwise change it. Period. It’s not only 
against the AdSense policies, but it could also render the code useless.
When Google generates code for you to use as a display on your site, there 
are some very important elements in that code. Among those elements is 
your user ID as well as information that tells Google what ads to display on 
your site.
If you start messing with the code, Google might not recognize it and ads 
won’t be pushed out to it. Or worse, ads that are completely irrelevant to 
your site might be pushed out. At least until Google figures out you mon-
keyed with the code — and then you could be banned from the AdSense pro-
gram altogether.
So don’t ever mess with the AdSense code. Copy it; paste it; forget it.
Blocking Ads from Your Competitors
One last tidbit before I wash my hands of this chapter completely: competi-
tion. Everyone hates it, but it’s what makes it possible for you to have that 
AdSense revenue stream. Still, you may decide that you don’t like the idea of 
having your competitors’ ads show up on your site. You can stop that, you 
know.
The Competitive Ad filter allows you to specify the URLs of sites for which 
you don’t want ads shown. You have a couple options, too. You can filter 
broad URLs, like an entire site, or you can filter specific pages within a site.
To filter broad URLs, follow these steps:
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com and log on to your AdSense 
account.

105
 Chapter 5: Installing the AdSense Code
 
2. Click the AdSense Setup tab and select Competitive Ad Filter from the 
row of links below the tab.
 
 A new page loads (as shown in Figure 5-25) that contains a form you can 
use to block your competitors’ ads.
 
3. In the space provided, enter the URL of the Web site that you want to 
block.
 
 For example, you could use the broad URL http://www.competitor.
com. Enter one URL per line.
 
4. When you finish listing the URLs of the competition you want blocked, 
click Save Changes.
 
 You’re done — although it could take up to a couple of hours for ads 
from the URLs you’ve blocked to stop showing on your site.
 
Figure 5-25: 
Enter com-
petitors’ 
URLs into 
the form to 
block their 
ads from 
displaying 
on your 
Web site.
 
If you use a broad URL, like the one in the steps above, every page with that 
base URL will be blocked. If there are only certain pages that you want to have 
blocked, you can enter a more specific URL for that site. So, for example, if 
there’s a single product page on your competitor’s site that you want blocked, 
you could enter the URL for that product page only. It might look something 
like this: http://www.competitor.com/product/product1.htm.
The more specific the URL, the less you’re blocking.
 
If you want to target a specific ad to be blocked from your site, wait until 
the ad shows up, right click it, and then select Copy Shortcut or Copy Link 
Location from the contextual menu that appears. Then paste that URL into a 
text editor and look for the link within the link.

106
Part I: AdSense Basics 
Here’s what I mean: When you right-click the ad and copy the link, you’re 
copying both Google’s location and the link that the ad leads to. It might look 
something like this when you paste it:
http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/
adclick?adurl=http://www.blogger.com/
signup.g&sa=
If you look closely at that URL, you see that there are actually two sets of 
http://. The first, at the beginning of the URL, points to Google Ad Services. 
That’s the URL that’s serving up the ad. The second one (after the equal sign) 
points to http://www.blogger.com/signup.g&sa. That is the URL that 
you want to paste into your competitive filter because it’s the actual URL for 
your competitor.
Many Web site owners who end up publishing AdSense ads use the Competitive 
Ad filter to ensure that their visitors aren’t sent to their competitors’ sites by 
mistake. It’s easy to use, so if you have any doubts about losing your visitors to 
your competition, take advantage of it.

Part II
The Major Players: 
AdSense for 
Content, AdSense 
for Search

In this part . . .
A
s you can tell from the title, this part of the book 
focuses on AdSense for Content and AdSense for 
Search. To help you take advantage of AdSense for Content, 
this part gives you all the details you need to create great 
content and design the perfect content ads, as well as help 
you build the perfect AdSense for Search box.
This part shares how to create content that visitors are 
looking for as well as how to design your ad to appeal to 
those visitors. After content is out of the way, I provide 
an overview of AdSense for Search and the differences 
between the two.

I
 promise not to grind the content horse completely into ground meat, but 
content is important, so you have to put up with me as I dive into a few 
more content issues. I know you know that content is the cornerstone of your 
Web site — actually, it’s great content but that’s such an overused term — and 
you also know that there are quite a few different avenues for collecting the 
content that you can use to populate your site. (You know that because you’re 
smart, and I know you’re smart because you bought a For Dummies book.)
What I think still needs to be covered is the actual writing process, the 
option of hiring someone else to do it, and using content other than written 
articles and blog posts. Don’t get me wrong. Written articles and blog posts 
are important, and you’ll probably have far more written content on your 
site than anything else, but using video is a great option, too — especially 
because the occasional video helps acclimate your visitors to seeing video on 
your site. Then you can use AdSense video ads once in a while, too.
One more thing. What do you do with all that content after you find it, write 
it, or purchase it? Keeping content fresh can be a full-time job if you have a 
site that’s more than a few dozen pages in size. Think of those sites that have 
hundreds or even thousands of pages. Keeping that content interesting and 
new is a nightmare endeavor!
Well, it is unless you have some method to tame that monster, and taming 
methods do exist. It’s just a matter of finding the one that works best with the 
plans that you have in mind.
So, yeah, I’ve already talked about content, but there’s still plenty to cover, 
so bear with me just a little longer, okay?

110
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
Foundations for Great Content
Great content — what a terrible, horrible phrase. What, exactly, constitutes 
great content? Isn’t “great” content kind of like a college (or a high school) lit-
erature course? Remember those? You go to this class, and the instructor thrusts 
a book at you and says, “You must read this and tell me what it means.”
Great. I would read those books, but the meaning I found was never the same 
as the meaning the instructor found in them. I always got so-so grades in lit-
erature because of it, and I still don’t understand. Who is that instructor to 
tell me what that writer was thinking when he or she wrote that piece of lit-
erature? Was the instructor sitting on the writer’s shoulder during the writing 
process? Or maybe the writer dialed up the future and asked the instructor 
for direction on what should be written? Not likely.
Literature is subjective — as is content. What I think is great content might 
absolutely drive the next visitor to your site completely insane. He could find 
the article boring or lively, instructing or condescending. Every person inter-
prets what’s put before them differently.
That doesn’t mean that great content can’t be achieved, though. It’s more 
accurate to call it appealing content — your content should appeal to the 
majority of visitors that land on that page. The truth is you can’t purchase, 
steal, borrow, or copy anything that will appeal to everyone. What you have to 
shoot for is content that appeals to the majority, and there are some guidelines 
for writing to the majority of people that will land on any one of your pages.
Knowing your audience
Before you can put anything on paper (or on-screen as is the case here), you 
have to know who you’re addressing. If you’ve done any targeting research 
on your Web site, you already have some of this information. If you haven’t, 
you’d better get to it. The only way you’ll ever reach your audience in the 
first place is to have a Web site that’s well targeted to them.
Here’s an example: Say you own the Web site Greenparenting.com (in real 
life, the site actually forwards to GreenForGood.com, but we’re talking hypo-
thetical here). Just looking at the name for that site, you automatically know 
that the site should be targeted to parents who are environmentally respon-
sible. Now, what you need to know is who those people are.
If you know your industry, you can do a little research and find out that the 
people who would be interested in green parenting are probably upper-middle 
class adults in their late 20s to early 50s. These are people who fall into the 
parenting age. Being environmentally friendly isn’t cheap, so a decent income 
is required to be truly dedicated.

111
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
Now you have a profile. Your site visitors have these characteristics:
 
 They’re parents.
 
 They’re in their late 20s to early 50s.
 
 They have a household income of $75,000 or more.
 
 They’re concerned about the environment.
As you’re reading through those few facts, you should already have a picture 
of these Web site visitors in your mind. If you haven’t done the spadework 
necessary to come up with a picture of a typical visitor to your own Web site, 
do it now. You can’t accurately target anything on your Web site until you 
know who you’re serving. That includes creating content that your visitors 
are looking for and that they want to read.
Language considerations
The language that you use in your content can be addressed on a couple dif-
ferent levels. First, is the what language do most of your readers speak level. 
Obviously, this level is completely out of your control. It makes no sense 
at all to create content for your site in English if most of your visitors are 
Japanese.
 
If you have any doubts at all about the native language of your visitors, look at 
your analytics software. Most analytics packages have some element of track-
ing visitors based on their language. In Google Analytics (which I highly rec-
ommend because it’s very user-friendly and FREE!), the actual report is in with 
a group of reports that segment users according to differing characteristics, 
such as language location.
A language report tells you the native language of each of your site visitors 
based on what’s set as the default language in their Web browser.
A different aspect of language is the words that you actually use to communi-
cate with your visitors. I can quote you all kinds of facts about how the aver-
age person reads at an 8th-grade level or how readers perceive words on a 
screen differently than how they perceive words on a page — all that is true. 
What’s more important to understand about the language that you use to 
communicate with your visitors is that it should be familiar to them.
Jargon (those words that are inevitably coined for every topic on the planet; 
really, every topic can be explained with jargon) isn’t familiar. For example, 
analytics is actually jargon. It’s used to mean Web site traffic statistics. 
Analytics is actually a derivative of the word analyze, which means to exam-
ine critically. So, by definition then, analytics would be the science of analyz-
ing. Yet, I use it most frequently when associated to Web site traffic statistics.

The problem with jargon is that if you stay immersed in a subject long 
enough, it becomes part of your normal speech and thought patterns. 
Unfortunately, that might not be true for your Web site visitors.
If you place an article or blog post on your Web site that’s full of jargon and 
your site visitors don’t view that jargon from the same perspective as you, 
they’ll get frustrated very quickly. Visitors don’t want to struggle through 
articles and blog posts filled with terms that seem to be used as part of some 
coded language. (BBC World War II Upper Class Twit Announcer Voice: “The 
geese are carrying the potatoes over the vicar’s pond. I repeat: The geese are 
carrying the potatoes over the vicar’s pond.”) They want to skim your stuff, 
pluck out the information they need like the ripest and sweetest grapes, and 
move on. Jargon slows them down, so don’t use it.
If you do find that jargon is necessary in your content, be sure to explain 
what it means the first time it appears in any article or blog post. The idea is 
to make your content as easy to read as possible without being overly sim-
plistic. This is where it gets a little tricky.
Understanding visitors with Google Analytics
Google Analytics is Google’s free Web site traf-
fic analytics program. It’s easy to use and pro-
vides a wealth of information about the visitors 
to your site, so don’t let its dry-as-dust name 
scare you away from using it. Detailed coverage 
of Google Analytics is in Chapter 14, including 
where to get the application and how to make it 
work with your Web site, but I thought you might 
like to know a little more about it right now.
Google Analytics, which started life as Urchin 
Analytics — a program that wasn’t free — 
offers nearly 50 standardized analytics reports 
as well as reports that you can customize, all 
of which tell you about the visitors to your site. 
As a free program, it’s one way for you to find 
out more about your site visitors without having 
to spend a tidy sum on the insight that an audi-
ence research firm will cost you.
Broadly speaking, Google Analytics offers you 
reports in four different areas: Visitors, Traffic 
Sources, Content, and Goals. The neat thing 
about Analytics from an AdSense perspective is 
that it features reports that are AdWords-specific 
(very handy, that) and reports that apply very spe-
cifically to any SiteSearch capabilities enabled 
on your site (including those capabilities that you 
may have enabled through AdSense).
Installing and using Google Analytics is simple 
and doesn’t require a technology degree. It 
takes about an hour to set up an account and 
paste the provided code into the HTML on your 
Web site. After you place the code on your site, 
it should take a couple days to start seeing sta-
tistics. And after you collect statistics for about 
a month, you can begin seeing patterns in how 
your site visitors use your site.
Google Analytics may well be the secret weapon 
that you never knew you needed. At worst, it 
tells you more about your site visitors than you 
could ever gather with your AdSense reports 
alone. At best, you’ll find out enough about your 
users to begin understanding what they’re look-
ing for and how you can provide it for them.

113
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
 
If you’re too simplistic in the language that you use in your content, most 
readers are turned off. I find it’s usually best to choose one person that rep-
resents your audience and write your content so that person can understand 
it. For me, it’s my best friend, who happens to be a serious technophobe while at 
the same time being one of the most intelligent people I know. I write with her in 
mind, phrasing things in such a way that I don’t insult her intelligence and yet get 
the fundamentals of (an at times rather complicated) technology across.
If I can write about technology at a level that she understands but that 
doesn’t grate on her nerves, I count myself successful. Use the same trick 
with your site visitors. Think of someone you know who represents your 
readers, assume his or her knowledge of your topic isn’t as deep as your 
own, and then write to that person. If necessary, you can even ask that 
person to read what you’ve written the first few times. If he has questions, 
he’ll ask. If he understands it and the language doesn’t annoy him, you know 
you’re on the right track.
Getting Fresh with Content
Here’s a simple exercise for you. Do a quick search on Google for whatever 
topic interests you. It doesn’t matter what the topic is, just pick something. 
When the search results come in, click through 20 or so of the results and 
make note of what you see. How many times does the same article or group 
of articles appear in those search results?
I bet it’s more than once. I research a lot of topics on the Web, and the one 
thing that I’ve noticed in nearly every topic is that the same articles appear 
over and over again. It’s a phenomenon that happens both in print and on the 
Internet, but it’s far more noticeable on the Internet because information is 
just a Web search away. In print, you actually have to collect the books and 
newspapers together in one place to notice the patterns.
Everyone uses the same articles. Well, okay. Maybe not everyone, but a lot of 
people do. It’s content syndication (or article syndication), and sometimes it hap-
pens on purpose — writers work hard to get their articles and stories syndicated 
and books published because that’s how they reach wider audiences. Sometimes 
it happens accidentally though — an article is placed online (it’s less likely to 
happen accidentally in print), and other Web site owners find it, like it, and either 
with permission or without, copy it and use it on their own Web sites.
Another reason you see the same article everywhere is because companies 
exist that sell packages of pre-made Web pages or even just packages of arti-
cles that you can place on your Web site that are targeted around a specific 
keyword or topic. These packages are sold both on Web sites and on auction 
sites like eBay, and they’re available to everyone — and I do mean everyone.

114
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
The problem with that kind of content is that although it’s easy to find and 
for the most part inexpensive to purchase, it’s old. It’s so old it’s bleu-cheese 
moldy — which is precisely why you find it everywhere. Nothing’s more frus-
trating to someone than clicking through a bunch of links looking for informa-
tion just to find that one-third of those links all lead to the same article on a 
different Web site.
 
If you truly want to generate traffic volume for your Web site (and you do, 
because the more traffic you have, the more AdSense revenue you generate), 
fresh content is what you need. Fresh content is new, different, and doesn’t 
show up on 5,000 different Web sites. It’s your own content that you’ve written 
or had written for your specific audience to meet their exact needs.
Your Web site visitors will love you for it. Potential Web site visitors are 
more likely to stay on your site, reading your articles, viewing your other 
types of content, and eventually clicking your AdSense ads if you’re offering 
them content they can’t find elsewhere. The only place to get that kind of 
content is to either write it yourself or hire someone to write it for you.
Article Wrangling
Folks who want to take the easy way out when populating their Web sites 
with content snatch up as many reprint articles as they can. (Reprint articles 
refer to that small pool of articles that gets replicated out onto a gazillion 
Web sites, kind of like that Agent Smith guy in The Matrix.) You can get 
reprint articles anywhere. A ton of content syndicates are online where you 
can purchase articles for a few dollars, but so can everyone else.
You can even use public domain works — those written articles and books 
for which copyright has expired and thus have slipped back into the public 
domain. You can publish them without the permission of the author, but 
again, so can everyone else.
If you want truly original content, you have to do it the hard way — you have 
to write it or hire someone else to write it.
Creating original content
Writing your own articles and blog posts isn’t as hard as it sounds unless you 
have hundreds of Web pages to populate, which could become a very time-
consuming effort. If that’s the case, you’ll have to use some reprints, but it’s 
still best if you try to keep the most important pages on your site filled with 
original content.

115
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
Coming up with ideas for your original content isn’t too difficult. If you don’t 
already have a list of ideas based on what you know your visitors are look-
ing for, spend about an hour brainstorming some ideas. You won’t use them 
all, and some of them will be just plain silly, but you’ll come up with some 
good ideas. Here’s a secret every writer knows: The more you write, the more 
ideas you have.
When it’s time to actually write the articles for your Web site, a few basic 
principles should be applied. These principles help make it easy for your site 
visitors to read your articles. The short list looks like this:
 
 Article layout: The experience of reading on-screen is very different 
from reading on paper. On-screen, it’s much easier to get lost. Eye strain 
is also much more common when you focus on a computer screen for 
too long. Computer screens have an invisible bar that scrolls across the 
screen refreshing the image constantly. If you’ve ever seen a computer 
Selecting the best fonts
The whole issue of fonts can be a little confus-
ing, especially when you begin to listen to the 
experts on the topic. It seems that every expert 
has a different opinion on what’s best to use on 
the Internet.
Fonts come in two flavors: serif fonts and sans 
serif fonts. Serif fonts have small strokes that 
lead into a letter; sans serif fonts don’t. There’s 
a lot of debate as to which is easier to read 
both online and in print. The fact is, though, that 
there’s really no easy answer to that question 
because other factors — spacing, font size, and 
screen resolution — also make a difference in 
what works and what doesn’t.
The most common serif fonts that you find 
online are Times New Roman and Georgia. The 
most common sans serif fonts online are Arial 
and Verdana. Which ones are best? Consensus 
is that Verdana is one of the best fonts to use for 
Web pages because of the spacing of the font 
and the design of the letters. However, you’ll 
find that many Web sites also use Times New 
Roman and Arial.
Personally, I use Arial in a lot of the work I 
do online, simply because it’s a more appeal-
ing font to me. Verdana is my second choice. 
When you get below a 10-point font (the size 
of the font), Arial becomes very difficult to read 
because the letters are so closely spaced.
Choose the font you use on your site based on 
the layout of the site and the needs of your visi-
tors. Obviously, you want to appeal to the larg-
est audience possible, so common wisdom is 
that you should use the font best suited to as 
many people as possible — Verdana.
One thing is certain, however. Whatever you 
do, don’t use a crazy font like Vladimir Script or 
Curlz MT just because you think it looks neat. 
Those fonts are very difficult to read. Because 
reading on-screen is already harder on their 
eyes than reading from a printed page, you 
want to make it as easy as possible for your 
visitors to get through an entire article (or even 
several articles) on your Web site.

116
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
on TV that has a black line scrolling through it, that’s what I’m talking 
about.
 
 You don’t see this line because of the rate that it rolls across your 
screen, but it causes slight vision anomalies that your eyes pick up on, 
even though it doesn’t register in your brain. These anomalies are what 
cause eye strain.
 
 One way to combat eye strain is to keep your articles as sparse as pos-
sible. That doesn’t mean skimping on the content but does means you 
need to use lots of white space — open space without words — and use 
a type font that’s screen-reading friendly.
 
 It works best when you’re laying out your articles if you single space (or 
even use a space and a half) between each paragraph of type. Also try 
to keep your paragraphs short and resist the urge to pack everything, 
kitchen-sink style, into a single sentence. Long sentences are easy to get 
lost in.
 
 Between paragraphs, use a double space. The extra white space 
between paragraphs gives the eyes a second to rest before moving into 
the new text.
 
 Reading-friendly colors: Color can be your best friend or your worst 
enemy online. The first thing to remember when dealing with Web site 
colors is that colors display differently on-screen than they do on paper — 
and colors display slightly differently on different screens. So test your 
colors in the real world — online rather than on paper. It wouldn’t hurt 
to take a peek at your Web masterpiece from a few different computers.
 
 The second thing to keep in mind when dealing with colors is that com-
puters are already prone to causing eyestrain, so if you use wild colors 
on your Web site, that exacerbates the problem. Believe me: Nothing’s 
worse than clicking through a link to find a Web site with a black or dark 
blue background and yellow type. It’s hard to read and will send your 
readers clicking back to where they came from.
 
 It’s always better to stick with muted colors, and white or black text. 
Some of the most successful Web sites online have white backgrounds 
with black text. These combinations are not only natural, they’re also 
eye friendly. Even a black background with white text can get tiring 
very quickly. So, if you absolutely insist that your Web site have broad 
swaths of color, try to make it something that you don’t mind staring 
at for five to ten minutes. If you can’t read a whole article in the color 
scheme that you choose for your site, find a different color scheme. If 
you don’t, your visitors will go elsewhere.
 
 Titles and headings: Because reading is much more of a chore online, 
many people don’t completely read everything. Those who do read 
everything skim a page first just to make sure it’ll be worth their time to 
read through it. That means you need to catch your visitors’ attention as 
quickly as possible.

117
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
 
 The best way to do that is with your article or blog post titles and head-
ers. Titles are the first impression you get to make with your article. 
They should be catchy and in a larger font than the rest of the article. 
It’s also a good idea to make them bold to stand out.
 
 Headings are the mini-titles that signal new sections of your article or 
blog post. Like titles, they should be larger than the text surrounding 
them (but not as large as the title size) and should be in bold type-face. 
This makes them both easy to skim and easier to read.
 
 You want your headings to be catchy, but they need to be descriptive 
as well. It does no good at all to use a header like, “Lost in Space,” when 
your article is about pruning your prize roses. Readers won’t get it, so 
they won’t connect the dots. A better heading might be something like 
“A Snip in Time.”
 
 There’s an added bonus to using apt titles and headings in your articles — 
titles and headers are often closely examined by search engine crawlers 
in their ongoing attempts to correctly categorize your site. The crawler 
pounces on titles and headings to determine the content on your site, 
so be sure to fill such elements with appropriate keywords and phrases 
whenever possible.
 
 Links within articles: One last element that you should include in 
your articles and blog posts is links to other, related articles and blog 
posts, both on your Web site and on others’ Web sites. Linking to other 
resources provides additional information for your site visitors. Usually, 
those visitors will click through those links and then click back to the 
page from which they came. If you worry about visitors clicking away 
from your site, never to return, set your links up so that they open in a 
new window. Opening links in a new window keeps your Web site open 
and in front of the visitors. When they’re finished examining the site 
you’ve linked to, they can close the window and be right back on your 
Web site.
 
 Another advantage to using links to other resources is that when you 
create links within your content, you’re adding to your link structure, a 
facet of your Web site that search engine crawlers consider when rank-
ing your Web site.
 
Think of a link structure as the framework of links that you create on your 
Web site. The framework includes internal links — those links that connect 
your pages within your site — and external links, which lead visitors away 
from your site. It also includes links that lead to your site from other pages. 
Although it’s true that you have a little less control over how many other sites 
link to your site, don’t underestimate the power of a little you scratch my back 
and I’ll scratch yours negotiating. You can offer free articles to other Web sites 
that include a link back to your site, for example, or you can just exchange 
links with other Web sites.

118
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
The key is to keep a good balance of the links to other pages on your site and 
the links to other pages off your site, and work diligently to bring other links 
into your site from relevant sources. Links from Web pages that are unrelated 
are much less useful than links from relevant pages. Just remember that 
having too many internal links or too many external links could be more det-
rimental than helpful. Try to keep an even mix of internal and external links.
Creating your own content isn’t difficult. It can take a little time, but when 
you get the hang of formatting your articles and blog posts for the Web, it 
goes faster, making it almost as easy as writing down your thoughts.
You’ll be rewarded for putting out the effort to come up with original content. 
Web surfers are looking for new, original, and helpful information online. 
Surfers who log on to the Internet do so for many reasons, but the number-
one reason stated by surfers is to find information. If the information you 
provide is fresh and new, you’ll have more (and higher quality) visitors than 
would ever be possible if you were using recycled content.
Hiring someone
Some Web site owners just don’t have the time to write their own content. If 
that’s you, you don’t have to lose out on the value of original content. Instead 
of doing it yourself, you can hire someone to do it for you.
Hiring someone, of course, means paying them. You can put ads on the Web 
for writers to produce content for your site for free, but you get what you pay 
for. In every case, the writer who’s willing to work for free has no (or very 
little) experience, and many of them have no talent.
That said, exceptions to the rule do exist. Once in a while, you can find a 
great writer, with experience, who’s willing to work for free because she loves 
to see her name in print. This might work out for you one-tenth of a percent 
of the time. The rest of the time, it’s just more headache than it’s worth.
You can, however, hire a writer without breaking the bank. Good writers are 
often willing to work for small amounts of money (say $10 to $50 per article) 
if the exposure is right, and if the person or company requesting the work 
pays quickly and consistently. It also helps when articles aren’t too involved. 
If what you’re looking for is a 1,000 word piece with three interviews, how-
ever, you’re not likely to find a good writer to do it for $50. However, if you’re 
willing to pay $200–$400, you won’t have a problem finding writers.
 
If you do decide that hiring a writer is the way to go, you need to get (and give) 
contractual specifications in writing. Even if it’s nothing more than an e-mail 
that states the guidelines for the article, the size of the article, the due date, 
and the pay, you have to have something that both you and the writer agree 
on. Then stick to your side of the bargain.

119
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
You may encounter writers who say they’ll provide what you’re looking for, 
but then don’t. It happens, and the only way to be sure you’re getting some-
one who won’t leave you high and dry is to check references. Treat writers 
just as you would employees. Make sure they are who they say they are. 
Then, be flexible about how the writer goes about writing the article you 
request. As long as the article is turned in on time and meets the specifica-
tions that you set forth in the beginning, don’t bug them about how they get 
to that point. (Unless plagiarism’s involved — then you must get involved, 
but there’s more about that near the end of this chapter.)
One other option that you have — one which could potentially cost you a 
lot less than hiring a writer — involves inviting guest writers to put together 
articles for your site. You have to use caution with this method, too, though. 
Guest writers sometimes write a few articles that they pass around to every-
one on the Internet, which makes their contribution to your site not nearly as 
valuable as if they wrote the article specifically for your site.
You can ask for that specificity, though. When you approach a guest writer, 
nothing’s wrong with asking him to write an article specifically for your site. 
Make sure you lay out exactly what you’re looking for, though. Usually it’s 
okay to ask for the right to publish the article first for a specified amount of 
time (like six months) before the writer allows others to publish it. You also 
want to make sure you have the right to archive the article on your Web site 
so that it remains available to users even after that six-month period (or how-
ever long you choose) is over.
In exchange for writing for you, most guest writers want a small blurb or link 
pointing back to their products and services. It’s usually worth it. In fact, it’s 
so worth it that many companies have a stable of writers that write these 
types of articles for them all the time. They offer these articles to all publica-
tions that target their own audiences. It saves the company marketing dollars 
and provides great content for your site.
 
One caveat when it comes to guest writers: If you plan to use a guest writer, 
make sure the article that’s provided isn’t too sales-y. When someone comes 
to your site to read an article, he doesn’t come because he wants to be sold to. 
He comes because he’s looking for information. Nothing’s wrong with making 
a recommendation for products or services, and nothing’s wrong with allow-
ing guest writers to include a small paragraph about themselves or their prod-
ucts and services at the end of the article, but it still needs to be as objective 
as possible.
A guest writer’s purpose is always to sell something. Whether that something 
is a product or service, there’s an ulterior motive. It’s your job, as the site 
owner, to keep that motive in check so you’re not running a big advertising 
service. Always remember to give your visitors the information that they’re 
looking for first and foremost. If you do, everything else is gravy.

Automating Content Management
Hundreds of Web pages on your site mean hundreds of pages of content that 
you have to deal with. That’s a massive undertaking for even the most industri-
ous of Web site owners. Fortunately, tools are available — known as content 
management systems — to help you manage your content without driving your-
self completely into a coma, and some of them won’t even make you crazy.
A content management system is a piece of software that’s used for organiz-
ing and facilitating what’s referred to as the collaborative creation of docu-
ments and other content. In other words, content management systems help 
you to create and manage the content on your Web site. For example, if you 
have a set of articles that you want to first feature on your Web site and then 
have moved to an archival section when a new article is featured, a content 
management system helps you do that without having to build a new Web 
page every time you change the feature articles.
The problem with content management systems is that if you get a propri-
etary system — a system built specifically to meet your content manage-
ment needs — you’ll pay upward of $100,000. If you fork over that amount 
of dough, you can rotate articles from features to archives to your heart’s 
Tapping multimedia
Content can be so much more interesting these 
days than it was in the past. Back in the early 
days of the Internet, content was stuff you 
wrote down. Period. There were few pictures 
and almost no audio or video. The adoption of 
broadband Internet access has changed that.
Today, in addition to your written content, 
you can also feature audio and video content. 
Podcasting — recording spoken messages that 
your site visitors can download — and stream-
ing videos are some of the hottest technologies 
on the Web right now.
You do have to have some specialized equip-
ment to create podcasts and videos, though, 
and it’s a little more involved when it comes to 
placing them on your Web site so that others 
can download them. I don’t go into the details 
of how to do that here. If you want additional 
information about creating those kinds of con-
tent, there are dozens of really good books 
(including For Dummies books like Podcasting 
For Dummies, by Tee Morris and Evo Terra) on 
those topics.
You don’t have to create videos to have them 
as content on your site, though. YouTube — 
Google’s video service — is a great way to 
include video content on your site. All you have 
to do is find videos that relate to your Web site 
and then you can add them to the page or to 
your blog by copying and pasting a snippet of 
code into the HTML on your site.
Multimedia content offers a little variety for your 
Web site. Because multimedia is the Internet 
darling of the moment, there’s no reason not to 
tap into this alternative to fill out your content 
offerings. Anything that draws visitors to your 
site is a useful tool for improving your AdSense 
revenues.

121
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
content and even set it up so that several people can seamlessly contribute 
to blogs on your site. This might all sound dandy, but just keep in mine that if 
you’re having the system designed specifically for you, you’ll shell out some 
serious coin to have it done.
 
You don’t have to use a proprietary system, though. Several open source soft-
ware applications for content management exist.
Open source software is software that’s created by an individual or company 
and then shared freely with others. Others can use the software and even 
change it to specifically meet their needs, without having any expenses to 
worry about.
The only real drawback to open source content management systems is that 
you either have to be very knowledgeable in certain types of programming 
or you have to hire someone who is knowledgeable to take care of it for you. 
True, you could pick up some good books on the topic, but if you’re not a 
code jockey, you’ll find that the books probably leave you a little lost.
Still, if you think you can handle the challenge, Drupal is a good open source 
content management system, and believe it or not, so is the blogger’s friend, 
WordPress. Okay, I know WordPress is usually thought of as being a blogging 
system, but it can also be used as a content management system. If you’re 
intrigued, check out the next sections.
WordPress as a content 
management system
Although WordPress is primarily known as a blogging tool, it really is much 
more. With a few modifications — a couple plugins and custom templates — it’s 
possible to use WordPress as a content management system. In one sense, 
WordPress is already a content management system because it’s a blog appli-
cation. All blog applications are essentially content management systems 
because they allow you to create, share, and store content from a single loca-
tion. By modifying WordPress just a little, you can also use it for other con-
tent management functions, such as managing

 News and magazine sites
 
 Article libraries
 
 Gallery sites
 
 Photologs
 
 E-commerce sites

WordPress site designs are based on the idea of themes. Themes are basically 
design templates that can be uploaded to your server and then assigned from 
within the WordPress Control Panel. The beautiful thing about templates or 
themes is the ability to alter them. WordPress and other blog platforms tend 
to use a lot of proprietary code that can be difficult to get just right when 
you’re putting together a design template. By relying on a pre-designed tem-
plate, you can focus on editing the graphics and moving snippets of code 
around to get the design that you want.
WordPress also has a handy little feature — Page Management — that allows 
you to create static Web pages — pages that always remain the same. You 
can create top-level pages that show in the navigation bar of your Web site or 
you can create lower-level pages that live underneath your main navigation 
topics. These secondary pages appear as drop-down navigation under the 
main links in your navigation bar.
Other features of WordPress include a built-in blog roll, which makes creat-
ing a list of related links as simple as filling out a small form to add a new 
listing. The best part? No HTML is required to do this. The WordPress panel 
also allows site owners to quickly change the appearance of their sites by 
switching from one theme to another as simply as selecting a new theme. 
WordPress does the rest.
WordPress also has plugin capabilities, meaning you can ‘plug in’ small addi-
tional bits of code that someone else creates to add functionality to your 
WordPress site. Examples of plugins are the capability to use WordPress 
as a content management system, or even features you can add to your 
WordPress blog, like a picture viewer or video player.
Plugin management is mostly seamless in WordPress, and that’s where you 
find the real benefit of using WordPress as a content management system. 
Plenty of plugins are available, and there are usually detailed instructions for

Going forward with WordPress
You don’t have to be a certified geek to use WordPress as a content manage-
ment system, but there is a learning curve, and it can take a while to traverse. 
If you want to find out more about installing and customizing WordPress 
to be your content management system — no matter what type of Web site 
you’ve created — check out WordPress For Dummies, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson 
and Matt Mullenweg. If you prefer getting your info right from the source, 
grab the WordPress Codex at http://codex.wordpress.org. The Codex 
is nothing more than a fancy name for the user manual. (If you don’t know 
where to find it, you could spend days searching for it.)

 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
If you’re trying to populate hundreds of pages and keep the content on those 
pages fresh, a content management system helps you automate the process. 
If you don’t have such a system in place, you might as well go ahead and shine 
up your coffin now because you’ll run yourself into the grave trying to keep up.
Understanding (And Respecting) 
Copyright
With all these content issues floating around, it’s only right to address copy-
right. As I mention earlier in the chapter, one of the reasons you see so many 
articles on the Web in dozens of different places is because those articles are 
placed on Web sites without the owners’ permissions.
This is the epitome of copyright infringement, and it’s illegal. It’s the same as 
using a program like Napster to download music that you don’t want to pay 
for. It’s out there, but it’s not ethical to use it, and it’s likely that you’ll even-
tually wind up in some serious hot water if you don’t go through the proper 
channels to get permission to use the article.
If you write articles for your own Web site and then find them on other peo-
ple’s sites without your permission, you’ll understand completely why copy-
right is such a big deal. You worked hard to put that article together, and 
whenever someone else puts it on their site without your permission, that 
person is just being a lazy so-and-so. What’s more, having your article pop up 
on every corner of the Internet devalues your content.
So, if you’re thinking about snagging someone else’s articles for your Web 
site without her permission, forget it. It may look appealing now, but when 
you get hit with a lawsuit for damages, it won’t be such a small deal. Writers 
are usually fiercely protective of the articles and stories that they right. If 
you’re stealing it, they’ll find out.
Determining copyright
Copyright infringement is a big deal, but copyright can be one of those tricky 
determinations that leave you wondering whether you’re okay to use an arti-
cle or other piece of content. The following are basic guidelines for dealing 
with copyright issues:
 
 For any work published prior to 1978, and marked with the proper copy-
right (©) notice, copyright lasted for an initial term of 28 years, renew-
able in the 28th year for an additional 28 years.

124
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
 
 With the introduction of the 1976 Copyright Act, copyright could be 
renewed for an additional 47 years.
 
 The Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 added another 
67 years to that renewal period.
 
 If a work published prior to 1964 wasn’t formally renewed, it entered the 
public domain when the initial 28-year term expired.
 
 In 1992, copyright renewal became automatic for any works published 
after 1963. Copyright owners after that period no longer had to apply for 
copyright renewal.
 
 When all these considerations are taken into account, if the copyright 
was renewed, the term of renewal was actually 75 years from the year 
of publication — expiring on December 31 of the 75th year following the 
initial publication — until the Sonny Bono act extended this to 95 years. 
This all means that if a work was published in 1922 or earlier, it is prob-
ably now in the public domain.
 
 Works that were published between 1923 and 1963 have a 95-year term, 
provided the copyright was formally renewed in the 28th year.
 
 Works published between 1964 and 1977 have a flat 95-year term.
 
 Works by individual authors created (meaning they just had to be writ-
ten, they don’t have to actually be published) after 1977 have a term of 
the author’s life + 70 years.
 
 Works by corporate authors, which are usually billed as works made for 
hire, that were created after 1977 have a term of 95 years.
Determining when a work was first published can be a little tricky. If a copy 
is available with a copyright notice, the notice should contain the year of 
first publication. New editions, which are sometimes called derivative works, 
meaning they have been derived from the original, often contain notices with 
the year of the publication of the derivative work and not the original year 
of publication; but if the date is prior to 1923, you can be confident that the 
work in question and all its predecessors are in the public domain. Anything 
published after 1923 is likely still under copyright protection, so you’ll have 
to be granted permission before using that work or part of the work.
The guidelines I lay out earlier apply both to print and electronic works. If 
someone’s created an original piece of work that appears on the Internet, he 
owns the copyright on it, whether it was officially registered with the copy-
right office or not. So, when you snag articles that are floating around the 
Internet, you’re stealing copyrighted materials. Writers can be a fiercely pro-
tective bunch. If you’re stealing their work and they find out about it, expect 
to have some legal issues to deal with.

125
 Chapter 6: Building the Right Content
If the work you want to use falls into that borderline territory (originally pub-
lished before 1964), you may have to do a little more research. Every year, 
the Copyright Office publishes a Catalog of Copyright Entries. This is in hard 
copy form for the years up to 1982 and solely in electronic form since then. 
The Catalog is online for entries since 1978. Some collegiate libraries have a 
copy of the Catalog. If yours doesn’t or you don’t have access to a collegiate 
library, you can visit the nearest Copyright Office to find a copy that you can 
browse to find the work in which you’re interested.
The thing to remember is that even if a work was first published between 1923 
and 1963, it’s in the public domain unless a timely renewal application was 
filed with the copyright office. However, works first published between 1964 
and 1977 must be assumed to be under copyright for the full 95-year period.
Requesting usage permissions
Unless you’re populating your Web site with material that’s turn-of-the-cen-
tury old, it’s a pretty good bet that you need to request permission to use a 
piece that’s been published elsewhere. To do that, you must first determine 
who holds the copyright.
Most materials contain the copyright symbol (©) and then a by line. It usually 
looks something like this: © by The Author or Owner’s name and a date. The 
name that follows the copyright symbol is who you need to contact to ask 
permission to reuse the material or portions of the material. Under the Fair 
Use doctrine of U.S. copyright law (specifically the Copyright Act of 1976), 
you’re permitted to use a small portion of a work, without having to request 
permission under certain circumstances. Those circumstances, however, 
aren’t always clearly defined. In most cases, it’s up to a judge to determine if 
the circumstances in which you use copyrighted material are permissible.
The size of a small portion is determined by the work that you’re planning 
to use:
 
 Motion media (such as movies): You can use up to 3 minutes, or 10 per-
cent of the original production, whichever is less.
 
 Text: With text you’re allowed to use up to 10 percent, or 1,000 words 
without permission, whichever is less.
 
 Poetry: Poetry is a little different. You can use entire poems, up to 250 
words, no more than three poems per poet, or no more than five poems 
from a single anthology. If a poem is longer than 250 words, use is lim-
ited to 250 words from the selection, no more than three excerpts by a 
poet, or no more than five excerpts by different poets.

126
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
 
 Music, lyrics, and music videos: Like other forms of content, with music, 
lyrics, and music videos, you can use up to 10 percent of the original 
work — not to exceed 30 seconds in the case of video. Also note that 
you may not alter a work to change the basic melody or character of 
the work.
 
 Illustrations and photographs: Usage for illustrations and photographs 
is limited to not more than 10 percent of the total number of images on 
your site, or 15 images, whichever is less. No more than five images may 
be used from a single artist or photographer.
 
 Numerical data sets: You can use up to 10 percent, or 2,500 field or cell 
entries, whichever is less, from a copyrighted database or data table.
Even though these guidelines are provided, it’s still possible to use only a 
small amount of a copyrighted work and to be sued for copyright infringement 
(which is using copyrighted material without proper permissions). That’s 
because there’s also a spirit of intent taken into consideration. Any judge can 
rule that the intent of your use of a piece of copyrighted material is unlawful, 
meaning you can be liable for damages if this is the case.
For that reason, you should always seek to attain permission if you plan to 
use any materials on your Web site that are copyrighted by another person 
or entity. To obtain permission to use copyrighted materials, usually all you 
need to do is request that permission be granted in writing. A sample letter 
like the one below is usually enough to legally gain permission. When you 
send the letter, ask that the copyright holder sign and return the letter to 
you, and then keep it on file in the event that any question arises in the future 
about whether you were granted permission.
Here’s the sample letter. Customize it to include your specific information:

Chapter 7
Designing the Per fect Content Ad
In This Chapter
 Creating appealing ads
 Choosing the best ad colors
 Working with borders
 Using multiple ads and varying ad types
Just in case you haven’t gotten this by now — AdSense success is all 
about the ads. Ad design and ad placement are crucial when it comes to 
AdSense, but the most important thing is that your ads don’t appear to be 
ads — as counterintuitive as that may sound.
I know; it’s nearly impossible to completely remove the advertising element 
from AdSense ads. No matter how well you integrate the ads into your con-
tent, the Ads by Google label is still there. Even so, the more your ads look 
like ads, the less likely it is that site visitors will bother to click them.
That means you should integrate your ads into your site content as well as 
you possibly can. That’s accomplished by changing the style of the ad — the 
text styles, colors, shapes, and borders — until the ads and your content flow 
together as one.
“Easier said than done,” you might say, but here’s where this chapter comes 
into play. Success with AdSense is all about knowing what works and what 
doesn’t. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a whole slew of tips and tech-
niques under your belt that you can use to make your AdSense strategy work 
for you.
Ad Appeal
You’re smart, you know the score: For site visitors to even consider clicking your 
ads, the ads have to be appealing. The way to make those ads appealing is 
to integrate them into the content that’s situated around them. Fortunately, 

130
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
AdSense gives you some good tools for matching your ads with the surround-
ing content. Remember, though, that what you’re creating here is just the 
container for the ad — its outside appearance. The actual ad text — or if the 
ad includes pictures, the images — are designed by the advertiser.
Customizing ads to work on your Web site begins when you create your ads. 
To create a new ad, simply log in to your AdSense account and then click 
AdSense Setup. From that page, select the type of ad you want to create. 
(If you need a refresher, the process of creating ads is covered in greater 
detail in Chapter 5.) In this chapter, I walk you through setting up AdSense 
for Content (in other words, a content ad) because it’s the type of ad that 
you’ll use most often. The principles that follow, however, work when you’re 
designing other types of ads, as well.
Text matching
Text ads need to be just as appealing as any other kind of ad. So, the natural 
inclination might be to dress up your text ad by making the text all kinds of 
pretty colors. Big mistake: Dressing up your text ads only makes them look 
more like ads.
One of the reasons that text ads are so appealing — and certainly the main 
reason they perform so well when compared to the other types of ads that 
AdSense makes available — is because text ads can be made to blend well 
into your Web page. Notice my use of can be here — they really only blend 
well if they look like their surroundings.
 
Keep in mind that you can’t change the font styles for the ads that you build 
with AdSense. You can, however, change the fonts on your Web site to help 
blend your ads better. If there’s a significant difference between the fonts of 
your ads and your Web site, that’s just what you’ll want to do.
Did I mention that making your ads appear to be part of your Web site is 
essential? Well, it bears repeating over and over again because this one little 
factor can completely change the success of your ads. Try to keep font styles 
similar between your ads and the text on your Web site. They don’t have to be 
an exact match. As great as that would be, it’s not always possible, especially 
because Google has decided not to make the font it uses in their ads available 
to normal mortals like us. (Okay, it kind of looks like several common fonts out 
there, but any typographer — someone who designs typefaces or fonts — will 
tell you that even subtle differences like spacing are very noticeable.)
Back to text design. What you do have control over with AdSense is the color 
of the text that you use for your ads. When you’re creating an ad, you have 
several preset options for color designs as well as the ability to create your 
own palette of colors for your ads. The next section shows you how you can 
put these options to good use.

131
 Chapter 7: Designing the Perfect Content Ad
Color or camouflage?
Google provides its AdSense users with a set of preset palettes offering what 
Google considers your best design options for your ads. You call up these 
palettes using the drop-down menu in the Style area as you’re creating your 
ads. Be aware though, that the preset palettes may or may not work on your 
pages — it really depends on the design of the page.
Here are the palettes that are available:
 
 Default Google: This palette includes a white background, white border, 
black text, blue title, and green URL.
 
 Open Air: This palette is exactly the same as the Google default. I’m 
not even sure why it’s included in the list, but it is. It’s a clone of the 
default — absolutely nothing’s changed.
 
 Seaside: In the Seaside palette, the only change involves the border. 
Instead of having a white border, this palette includes a seafoam-colored 
(yes, seafoam is actually a color) border.
 
 Shadow: With this palette, the colors begin to get progressively more 
noticeable. The title (which, by the way is also a link) is still blue, the 
text of the ad is black, and the URL is green, but the border is black and 
the background is pale blue. Drop this ad onto a white background, and 
it screams advertisement.
 
 Blue Mix: This ad style is significantly different from all the other styles. 
A light blue border, white title, light blue text and URL, and dark blue 
background make this one stand out. The only page that might be able 
to pull this ad off is one that’s designed in exactly the same colors. I rec-
ommend that you change your page if it’s built like this, unless you have 
a very strong reason to leave it alone (like hundreds of thousands of visi-
tors), because it’s hard on the eyes.
 
 Ink: The Ink style comes with a black background and border, and a 
white title, text, and URL. In other words, it’s similar to the Blue Mix 
style, but instead of being blue and white, this one is black and white. I 
admit it’s a little easier on the eyes, but only for short periods of time.
 
 Graphite: In my opinion, this is a boring ad style because it’s gray. Yuck. But 
on the right Web site, the black title, dark gray text, light gray URL, and pale 
gray background and border might work. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered 
a Web site it would work on, but stranger things have happened.
 
These styles are the ones that Google’s created. Although Google says they’re 
the most effective ad styles, people who really are making great money with 
AdSense will tell you that the defaults aren’t usually your best option. That’s 
okay though because Google gives you decent customization features for 
designing ads that are good options.

Tweaking the wizard
I cover the AdSense wizard in some detail in Chapter 5, but there I’m more 
interested in showing you how to generate the HTML you need to insert a 
default AdSense ad in your Web site. Now I want to show you how you can 
stray a bit from the beaten path so that you can come up with stuff other 
than the default settings.
As you might expect, you start out with the very same wizard I show you in 
Chapter 5. Here’s how you call it up:
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com and log on to your AdSense 
account.
 
2. Click the AdSense Setup tab.
 
3. Select AdSense for Content.
 
4. In the new screen that appears, choose the type of ad you want 
to create — Ad Unit, Text only, in this case — and then click the 
Continue button.
 
 The screen you see in Figure 7-1 appears.

the appear-
ance of 
your ads.
 
The Colors section.
 
5. In the Colors section of the screen, choose one of the pre-designed 
color palettes from the drop-down menu on the right.
 
 The Default Google palette is just as easy to work with as any other, but 
if you prefer one of the others over the default, that’s okay.

133
 Chapter 7: Designing the Perfect Content Ad
 
 All the colors that you can alter in the palette are shown below the pal-
ette name, as shown in Figure 7-2. Note that each color has a number to 
the left of it. This is the hexadecimal number that represents the color 
to Web browsers. (See the sidebar, “Decoding hexadecimal numbers,” 
for more on hexadecimal numbers.)

ber of colors

6. Use the Color Picker to the right of each ad element — Border, Title, 
Background, Text, and URL — to choose a new color for an element.
 
 As shown in Figure 7-3, when you click the Color Picker the nice colored 
square — a color palette opens from which you can choose other colors. 
Note that after you make the change, the sample ad in the lower-left 
corner of the wizard screen changes to reflect the new color.
 
 Play with your Color Picker just a little so you can get a feel for how wild 
you can make your ads. I don’t recommend making them wild for actual 
use, though. My strong advice to you will always be the simpler, the 
better. It’s still kind of neat though to see how you can change your ads 
just by changing the color of different elements of the ad.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The colors 
for each 
palette are

can be cus-
tomized.
 
Click the Color Picker...
...And the color palette opens.

134
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
 
 Here’s another neat hint. If you place your pointer over one of the colors, 
the sample ad in the lower-left side of the screen temporarily changes to 
that color. Move the pointer over a different color, and the color changes 
again. Take it away, and the color reverts back to the original.
 
7. Just below the Color Picker, use the Select Corner Style drop-down 
menu to specify how you want the corners of your ads to look: square, 
slightly rounded, or very rounded.
 
 These options only actually appear on your ad if you’re using a contrast-
ing border color. If you match your border to your background, you 
have this option, but the corners will blend into the background like the 
rest of the border.
 
8. Select the channel you want to use to track your ad and then click 
Continue.
 
 Remember that channels are categories that you create so you can keep 
up with how specific ads perform.
 
9. On the next page, enter a new name for your ad (if desired) and then 
click the Submit and Get Code button to generate the code for the ad.
 
10. Copy and paste the ad code generated into the HTML on your Web site.
These steps are okay for most situations, but I admit there’s one little problem 
with using the Color Picker to determine colors for your ad elements: Your 
color choices are somewhat limited. The palette that Google makes available 
to you shows only about 60 colors out of the hundreds that a browser can dis-
play. You’re not limited to those 60, though. You can further customize your 
colors by entering the hexadecimal number for the color you want displayed.
“What’s a hexadecimal?” you ask. I point you to the handy “Decoding hexa-
decimal numbers” sidebar for the full scoop, but the short answer is that 
hexadecimal numbers — the number/letter combinations you see to the left 
of the Color Pickers in Figure 7-2 — are part of a system for telling computer 
monitors how to display certain colors. Every color has been assigned a 
hexadecimal number, and if you enter that number into the appropriate box 
in Figure 7-2, your ad element takes on that color.
You may be thinking to yourself that hexadecimals look like Greek to you and 
you could never figure out what numbers correspond to what colors. The 
thing is that you don’t have to keep all those number/color correspondences 
in your head. The idea here is that you want the colors of your AdSense ads 
to blend in with colors already found on your Web site — meaning that if you 
can figure out the hexadecimal numbers of colors already on your Web site, 
you can then plug those numbers into your AdSense wizard (refer to Figure 
7-2) and then have the wizard generate code for ads that match your Web 
site colors to a T.

135
 Chapter 7: Designing the Perfect Content Ad
How does one determine the hexadecimal numbers of colors already on your 
Web site? I’m glad you asked:
 
1. Point your Web browser to your very own Web page.
 
2. After your page loads, choose View➪Source from your browser’s 
main menu.
 
 Note that you may have to choose View➪Source Code or View➪Page 
Source. Different Web browsers have different menus — the exact 
phrase is determined by the browser that you’re using.
 
 A new page appears, showing the source code for your Web site.
Decoding hexadecimal numbers
Hexadecimal has its roots in both the Latin and 
Greek languages. Hex is a Greek term meaning 
six and decimal is a Latin term meaning tenth. 
Literally translated, hexadecimal could mean 
either six to the tenth or six times ten. Either 
translation is correct because hexadecimal is 
a computer term used to mean grouped by 16 
or base 60.
If all that math stuff really interests you, I invite 
you to google hexadecimal to your heart’s 
content and read all the complicated theory 
behind hex and deci. I cut to the chase and let 
you know that hexadecimal numbers are used 
to specify the amount of red, green, and blue 
present in a color.
I’m sure your 2nd-grade art teacher told you 
that all colors could be broken down into the 
component parts of red, green, and blue. This 
insight is what drove computer-types into using 
the RGB/hexadecimal number model to repre-
sent colors using the following shortcut:
#RRGGBB
where RR tells your Web browser how much 
red to use, GG tells how much green to use, and 
BB tells how much blue.
So, to get that nice seafoam-colored border you 
see in Figure 7-2 (oops, I forgot — black-and-
white illustrations don’t show color . . . trust me, 
it’s a nice, foamy shade of blue) you’d use the 
following hexadecimal number:
#336699
For a computer to read this hexadecimal 
number as a color, the number sign (#) must be 
displayed immediately before the color code. 
Without the number sign, the hexadecimal 
code looks just like any other number, and with 
other symbols in front of the six-digit number, 
the code is read as a different type of indicator 
because hexadecimal code is used extensively 
in programming.
None of that really concerns you, though. What 
you really need to understand here is that hexa-
decimal numbers can be used by AdSense to 
help build ads that match your Web site per-
fectly. You may have to do a little experimenting 
or investigating to find the exact hexadecimal 
numbers that you need, but after you do, the 
results are perfectly rendered ads that look as 
if they belong on your Web site.

136

3. On this new page of source code, look for a line that starts something 
like this:
<style id=’page-skin-1’ type=’text/css’><!-- body 
{background:#ffffff;margin:0;color:#333333;
font:x-small Georgia Serif;font-size:small;
font-size: small;text-align:
 
 This is just the beginning of this line. If you actually copy and paste the 
whole line into a blank document, you’ll see that it’s a large block of 
code. This code tells you the style of your Web site. Notice that through-
out the code, there are different snippets that read
Color:#XXXXXX
 
 Those numbers represent the hexadecimal numbers you’re looking for.
If you look closely at your style id code, you’ll find all kinds of tags for the 
colors that are used in the design of your site. For example, in the code snip-
pet I highlight in the steps list before, the information
body {background:#ffffff;margin:0;color:#333333
tells you that in the body of the Web site, the background color is #ffffff 
(which in this case is white), the margin of the body is zero — which means 
there’s no margin), and the color of text is #333333 (which is a very dark 
gray).
If you look through the formatting for the body (that’s the information you 
copied from that one line of source code in the steps above), you’ll find the 
colors that you need. Aside from the background and text colors, you also 
need the color number for links (represented as a:link #XXXXXX). Simple 
enough to come by.
Notice that I didn’t say you need the numbers for border colors and for URLs. 
There’s a reason for that, which I expand on in the next couple sections. 
First, what do you do with the color numbers when you have them? You use 
them to help create ads that are a perfect match for your Web site.
Use the numbers you’ve collected to fill in the Title, Background, and Text 
fields of your AdSense ad design page of the AdSense wizard. All you have to 
do is delete the number that’s there — refer to Figure 7-2 — and key in the 
numbers you’ve collected in the correct space. In the sample ad in the lower-
left corner of the wizard screen, you should see the colors displayed after 
you click away from the color box you’re editing.

137
 Chapter 7: Designing the Perfect Content Ad
The borders are open . . .
Borders are made to keep people out or sometimes to keep them in. Either 
way, a border is like a fence. Even on paper, a border surrounds print and 
pictures to keep everything cohesive. So, why in the world would you want to 
(metaphorically, at least) fence in people by putting a border around your ads?
Borders scream, Hey, I’m over here. I’m an advertisement. Run! Really. I’m not 
even trying to be funny. Borders make ads even more ad-like than the Ad by 
Google logo that AdSense places on your ads — and you don’t want ad-like, 
trust me.
The best option is to blend your ads into the background of your Web site. 
That means using no borders at all. There’s one problem with that theory 
though — there isn’t a No Borders option.
What you have to do instead is make the border color the same color as the 
ad background. Your ad background is the same color as your Web page 
background, right? If it’s not, it should be.
What’s in a color?
Surf the Internet for a while and you’ll soon 
notice that nearly every Web page uses blue as 
the color for its hyperlinks. Why is that?
Answering that question requires a little back-
ground history. When the Internet first came into 
being, there was little you could do about page 
displays. The screens (or monitors) on which the 
pages were displayed were monochrome — 
basically black and green. Then color monitors 
came along, but the number of colors that could 
be displayed was limited.
If you wanted someone to know there was link 
on your Web site that led to another Web site, 
you had to do something that would alert the 
visitor to the link; thus the advent of blue links. 
Color limitation made it difficult to read text that 
wasn’t black or blue, and because black was 
the color of most text, blue became the choice 
for links.
It didn’t take technology long to mature to the 
point we’re at now, with technological capa-
bilities that allow us to generate thousands of 
amazing colors on a screen. There’s one small 
glitch though — Internet users have become 
accustomed to seeing links in blue, so often, if 
a link is another color, they don’t recognize it.
Fascinating, I know, but there’s a point to all 
this. When you’re designing your Web site, the 
most effective method of alerting users to links 
in your text is to make them blue. Now, your 
navigational links (on the left side or top of the 
page) don’t necessarily have to be blue. They 
can blend with your page design, but text links 
should always be blue. That means that it’s also 
a good idea to use blue for the links on AdSense 
ads that are integrated into your text. The color 
blue makes them more clickable and helps site 
visitors to see there’s something interesting 
behind those words.

Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
Remember the Golden Rule: Blend your ads into your Web pages so they look 
like they belong there. That means blending the border and the background 
of the ad with the background color of your Web site. Use the techniques 
outlined in the previous section to determine the hexadecimal number of the 
background color of your Web site and then use the AdSense wizard to set 
your ad background and ad border to that color.
 
The easiest way to keep everything straight is to keep your Web site simple. 
You’ll never go wrong with a white background and black text.
Camouflaging URLs
I want to move on to another topic as much as the next guy, but I need to 
cover one more thing about ad placement. AdSense ads consist of three 
zones: the title link, the text, and the URL. The title link is the title of the ad, 
and it’s obvious that the text is the text of the ad. No rocket science here, so 
we can safely pass them by. The URL is what I’m concerned with here.
The URL of the Web site that the ad belongs to can be a real problem. The 
URL isn’t hyperlinked — made into a link that leads to the Web address 
shown in the URL — because visitors are supposed to click the ad’s (linked) 
title, not the ad’s URL. The thing is that having a URL that doesn’t transport 
you to a new place on the Web when clicked can confuse a visitor, especially 
if you’ve chosen not to make the (linked) title of the ad blue.
Visitors see the URL and may click it, expecting to actually go somewhere. 
When they don’t go anywhere, that could alert them to the fact that they’re 
about to click an ad. After visitors think about that fact, however briefly, 
they’re less likely to mess with your ad at all by making those clicks.
For that reason, it’s best if the URL doesn’t in any way invite a site visitor 
to click it — and the best way to stifle that click impulse is to make the URL 
the same color as the text in the ad. It’s usually best to have ad text black, or 
whatever color the surrounding text is.
My preference is to have the title linked and colored blue and have the URL 
black. Site visitors (at least to my site) seem to like that configuration better, 
and I have more success when I stylize my ads this way. Will that hold true 
for you? Probably, but you can always switch things around and see.
The cool thing about AdSense is that it’s easy and costs nothing to tweak 
your ads until you find the style that works best for your visitors. So, give it 
a shot; change it up. Keep track of what you’re doing though so that when 
you’re done testing, there’s no doubt what works best in each different area 
of your Web site.

 Chapter 7: Designing the Perfect Content Ad
Using Multiple Ads
More dessert is a good thing. More money is a good thing. Sometimes, even 
more people is a good thing. And guess what? More ads can be a good thing, too.
Wow. I’m channeling Martha Stewart. But unlike Ms. Stewart, I won’t get all 
crafty on you, and I won’t tell you that multiple ads are a good thing, when 
in fact, sometimes they’re not. I just want to convey that adding multiple ad 
blocks to your Web pages can work well — if it’s done properly.
The appeal of multiples
Having multiple ads means more chances for site visitors to click your ads. 
With that reasoning, many Web site owners who add AdSense to their pages 
automatically put as many ads as they can on their Web site. Sometimes that 
works for them; other times, it doesn’t.
When it does work, multiple ads may improve your AdSense revenue signifi-
cantly or maybe just a little. But what makes multiples work? In a word: 
audience.
There are no hard and fast guidelines for what works and what doesn’t with 
multiples. In every instance, it comes down to how your audience uses your 
Web site and what kind of value they find in the ads that are displayed on 
your page.
For example, I’ve played with a lot of different settings for the ads on my blog 
in the process of putting this book together. One thing I did early on was to 
increase the number of ads that were shown on my blog by tweaking the blog 
template with code and by adding additional ad blocks using the widgets 
provided by my blogging application provider, Blogger. (Widgets are like 
mini-programs or additional capabilities within a program that you can add 
or remove at will.)
Before those changes, I was generating a few dollars each day with my 
AdSense ads. After the changes, the revenues dropped by a few cents each 
day, and I even had a few days where I generated no income at all.
In my case, it seemed that adding more ads made visitors less likely to click 
them. It may be the number of ads I chose to use, or it’s possible that I just 
chose the wrong combination of ads. That’s what makes testing different 
types, numbers, and configurations of ads so vitally important.

140
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
Using multiple ads — more than one ad unit per page — is usually a recom-
mended practice. Having multiples gives you the opportunity to catch your 
site visitors in more than one location. It also allows you to include ads on 
your site that may appeal to different audiences. For example, the site visi-
tors who are likely to click video ads may be a different set of visitors than 
those who’ll click links or text ads. Figuring out the right configuration of 
these ads just requires testing to see how your audience responds to each 
type of ad.
Getting in the zone
In watching the revenue numbers for my site — in this case, the actual 
earnings — I could see the results of the changes I made. Those results 
reflected different zones that were successful for ads on my pages.
A zone is an area of your Web site that draws readers’ eyes. Most Web sites 
have a header zone, a content zone, and a sidebar zone. Visitors focus on 
each of those areas for a different reason.
The header zone is where visitors look to confirm what site they’re on. Later, 
a visitor might look to the header zone to see if there are interesting or useful 
links for them to follow.
The content zone is where visitors focus most of their attention. This is where 
the main content of your site is found, and that’s what your visitors are look-
ing for. Content is first, links are secondary. Don’t get fooled, though. Links 
may be secondary, but they’re still an important part of the site.
And that’s exactly why there’s also a sidebar zone. Sidebar zones are where 
the cool stuff is usually found. Sidebars usually feature additional information 
or links to other resources.
Multiple ads need to appear in one of these zones. Which zones, you ask? 
I can’t tell you that. Try different configurations for all three zones to see 
what works. Test, test, test. You know your visitors, and you can deduce 
some facts about them and create theories for what will work. But until you 
actually try a specific configuration, you’ll never know.
Avoiding overkill
One problem with using multiple ad blocks on your Web pages is that you 
can quickly overdo it. A few ads can enhance the content on your page. Too 
many make it look crowded and confusing. Visitors won’t know what to look 
at first or which links to click.

141
 Chapter 7: Designing the Perfect Content Ad
If you have a blog service, you may be limited in the number of ads you can 
show on a page for this very reason. Blogger, for example, limits publishers 
to three instances of AdSense. You can place those three instances anywhere 
on the page, but if you place more than three ads, something won’t show up.
So should you limit each of your pages to three or fewer ads? That depends on 
your page and how well the ads integrate into the content and surrounding 
elements of the page. Remember, the rule is still to make your ads as invisible 
as possible. By making them invisible as ads, you’re making them visible as 
content, meaning they’re more likely to attract the attention of visitors.
 
You don’t literally want to make your ads invisible. You could, too. Changing 
the ads to make them blend completely into your background would certainly 
do the trick. But then, how would visitors click the ads? No, the invisibility 
superpower isn’t a good one to use in this instance. Just make your ads less 
obviously ads.
Multiples don’t have to be identical
I’ve already alluded to this fact, but let me come right out and say it: Multiple 
ads do not have to be identical. You can have one ad in your text and a differ-
ent kind of ad at the top of your page and another kind of ad in a sidebar, if 
that’s what works for your Web site.
In fact, that combination — one in each zone — is probably the most suc-
cessful way to have multiple ad blocks on most pages. It won’t work with 
every single Web site or even every single page on a Web site though.
When you’re configuring the ads for your site or blog, you may find that ads 
work better on some pages and not others. That’s okay. If you have a page 
where ads don’t perform well (or even at all), remove the ads from that page 
and find a way to work in links to pages where ads do perform.
Play with the configuration of your ads. For my Google-Geek blog, what works 
best are ads between the posts. In fact, ads at the top of the page and in the 
sidebar don’t work at all — I’ve never been able to generate income from them.
Ads inside the posts also didn’t work for that blog, so I took them out. Ads 
between the posts do work, though — but not all ads. A banner doesn’t per-
form as well as link units do. It took a lot of testing for me to figure out these 
facts about what ads work, where they work at, and how well they work.
 
When you’re testing your ads, be sure to try different configurations, but keep 
in mind that you do have to keep track of what you’re trying and how well it 
works. Keep a journal or a spreadsheet, or notes on a napkin if you have to. 
But keep track of what you’re doing so that when it comes time, you can set 
up your ads in a way that works best for you.

142
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
Also remember that with any kind of testing, what works today may fail you 
tomorrow. Your site visitors may change, the topic of your site may expand 
or narrow over time to suit your site visitors, and designs may get boring, 
so you’ll need to re-do them. All I mean is that your ads might work really 
well right now and not work at all two weeks from now or a year from now or 
whatever timeframe you choose. It’s not that you’re doing anything wrong. 
It’s just that things change. (You know the saying — there’s nothing constant 
in this world except constant change.)
Testing isn’t a do-it-once-and-forget-it proposition. You do it again and again 
and again, if necessary. Just remember, content gets stale, but so do ads. 
AdSense helps with this because the ads that are shown on your page change 
often. As your site matures, you may have to make more changes, so always 
be watching your revenue levels to see when the tried-and-true ways start 
becoming less effective.

for Search
In This Chapter
 Using AdSense for Search for revenues
 Searching the Web and your site in style
 Creating a custom search engine
 Developing the right AdSense search box for your Web site
 Making the color scheme simple
P
eople find content on the Internet by searching for it. This is a simple 
fact of life. You know it, I know it, and the folks at AdSense know it. You 
can take advantage of this simple fact of life by installing AdSense search 
capabilities on your site, capabilities that allow site visitors to either search 
your site or search the whole Internet, all the while providing for a nice little 
revenue stream back to your pockets.
If yours is a site that’s hundreds of pages deep, such a search capability for 
both the site and the Web is essential. Even if you have a smaller site though, 
search is an important element. Users may come to your site and find only 
part of what they’re looking for. How will they find the rest of it? Whether 
it’s on your site or not, you need to provide visitors with a way to find what 
they’re looking for.
AdSense for Search gives you the search capabilities you need, but you have 
to use it well. You have to work through a few things, including figuring out 
how your revenues will be made and what kind of search options will be best 
for the visitors who come to your site. You also have to think about whether 
it’s worth customizing your search box. (Hey, adding your own logo is a 
nice touch!) All these options make creating your search box a little more 
involved than creating ads for content — the stuff I cover in Chapter 7 — but 
I walk you through the rough parts.

144
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
Searching for Revenues
When it comes to searches that really turn up results, Google is the King of 
the Hill. A dozen or so other search engines are out there, and some of them 
even offer search capabilities for Web sites and enterprises; but none of them 
match the power of Google and none of them have gained the confidence 
of users like Google has. Google’s known for results, and that’s why using 
AdSense for Search makes so much sense.
If you’ve had a Web site for any amount of time, you’ve probably already dis-
covered that you must have search capabilities on your site. Whether those 
search capabilities are only for your Web site or are for the entire Web is a 
decision that’s best based on the amount of content you have on your site, 
but it’s probably no secret to you that users want search capabilities. In fact, 
you may have already added Google Search to your Web site, using either 
Google’s free search capabilities or the Google Custom Search Engine.
 
So, if you’ve already added Google Search to your site or you’ve strongly 
considered doing so, why not go the extra mile and add a search capability 
that makes you a little bit of money? Admittedly, AdSense for Search prob-
ably won’t ever make you as much money as AdSense for Content, but that 
shouldn’t stop you from trying. Why let even a little bit of potential coin surf 
away from your site untapped?
Here’s how it works: A visitor to your site types a search query into your 
AdSense-enabled Google search box in hopes of finding something either on 
the Web as a whole or just on your Web site. You don’t get paid just because 
the visitor used the search box on your Web site. Instead, you get paid if that 
visitor clicks one of the ads in the search results that are shown from the 
search box that you put on your page. It’s a secondary-click revenue stream, 
which means that, with AdSense for Search, the revenues are admittedly a 
little harder to get to. Visitors must first use the search box and then click 
through an ad for you to get paid.
Just because it’s not a direct click doesn’t mean you should ignore the 
potential of this AdSense approach. The fact is that every site has visitors 
that won’t find exactly what they’re looking for. If they found your site with 
a search engine, they’ll likely go back to that search engine and refine their 
search term. If they found your site directly and it doesn’t contain what they 
want, they’ll probably surf away to search for what they want.
Also, if you already have search capabilities on your site, visitors who use 
those capabilities are already seeing the ads that are shown in the search 
results. You’re just not getting paid for them. If you have the capability 
anyway, you should at least be able to collect revenue from increasing 
Google’s confidence level.

145
 Chapter 8: Understanding AdSense for Search
Besides, if the visitor will leave your site anyway to search for the informa-
tion she’s looking for, why not give her the option of searching from your 
site? The visitor benefits in time saved, and you benefit in the possible rev-
enue stream.
Plenty of options for the types of search you can allow are available, too. 
Users can
 
 Conduct a site search
 
 Conduct a Web search
 
 Conduct a targeted search
 
 See results returned on your Web site
 
 See results returned on the Google site
It’s not just plain vanilla search, in other words. You can really punch up 
your search capabilities so that your site visitors can search with style and 
find what they’re looking for. You can even direct the search so that users 
aren’t pulling information from your competition.
Search in Style
AdSense for Search is a capability that’s automatically enabled if you’re reg-
istered with AdSense at all. So, if you’ve created AdSense ads for your Web 
site content before now, you won’t have any problems creating your first 
AdSense search box. (If you haven’t created an AdSense ad or even created 
your AdSense account, flip to Chapter 2, where I cover all the details you 
need for getting your ads off the ground.)
It should only take a few minutes to create a search box for your Web site. 
I spell out the basics of setting up a search box in Chapter 5 — you know, 
logging on to your AdSense account, clicking the AdSense Setup tab, and 
then making your way through the AdSense for Search Wizard to generate 
the HTML code for your Web site — but I want to show you some of the 
tweaks available to you. For that, make your way to the AdSense Setup tab 
and click the AdSense for Search button. (If you need to refresh your memory 
on how to do that, check out Chapter 5.) Doing so calls up the first screen of 
a wizard (as shown in Figure 8-1) that walks you through customizing your 
search box. (Note that AdSense likes to keep things as simple as possible, 
so the customization page for search boxes is very similar to the content ad 
customization page.) With the first screen up and ready on your monitor, 
you’re ready to tweak your search box however you want to. The next few 
sections show you how.

Web and site searches
The first decision you have to make when it comes to designing your search 
box is whether to allow your users to search only the Web as a whole or to 
allow them to search the Web as well as your site or other sites that you 
choose. If your site is relatively small (under a couple dozen pages), there’s 
probably no sense in having a site search capability unless there are other, 
specific sites that you want search results drawn from. This is a function that 
works well if you have multiple Web sites and want to keep your sites in front 
of your site visitors as much as possible. If you have a single site, with just a 
few pages, it’s not quite as useful.

147
 Chapter 8: Understanding AdSense for Search
 
The more pages you have, the more difficult it is for your site visitors to find 
what they’re looking for, so you should definitely include site search capabili-
ties in the mix. The search boxes look a little different, depending on the capa-
bilities that you allow.
The top section of the first screen of the AdSense for Search Wizard (refer to 
Figure 8-1) is where you set up your Search Type options. Selecting the Google 
WebSearch radio button sets up the Web only search, whereas selecting the 
Google WebSearch + SiteSearch radio button lets you specify three specific sites 
to search. (You enter the URLs for your three sites in the text fields provided.)
Figure 8-2 shows the AdSense example for a search box that searches the 
Web as well as Web sites that you specify. You can enter URLs for up to three 
different Web sites that visitors can then search either individually or as part 
of a larger search.
 
Figure 8-2:

Figure 8-3 shows the AdSense example for a search box that allows visitors to 
search only the Web.

Another 
option is to

Which type of search is more effective for your site is determined by the site 
content and by what you hope to accomplish with an AdSense search box. If 
you have multiple sites, you can keep them in front of your site visitors even 

148
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
if your visitors don’t find what they need on the current site. Use AdSense 
search to provide for as many of your site visitors’ needs as possible even if 
your sites won’t answer their questions.
The middle and bottom sections of the AdSense for Search Wizard’s first 
screen (refer to Figure 8-1) let you customize the appearance of the search 
box itself as well as set a few other preferences. Neat stuff that I cover in suf-
ficient detail — but not now. (I lead you back to the wizard in the “Creating 
an AdSense Search Box section,” later in this chapter.) Right now I want to 
introduce you to a more high-powered way to customize your search engine 
with the Google Custom Search Engine page.
Creating customized searches
One other option for creating a search box for your Web site is to create a 
customized search engine. This isn’t exactly a feature of AdSense, but instead 
is a separate Google capability that works with AdSense so that you can mon-
etize the search capabilities that you give to users while directing it much 
more specifically.
A custom search engine is a creator-defined search capability, so you can 
specify which Web sites (or even which pages) you want to allow your visitors 
to search. The really cool thing about a custom search engine is that you can 
have more than the three sites that AdSense makes available for searches with 
an AdSense-specific search box. So if you want to allow your visitors to search 
7, 15, or even 50 specific sites, a custom search engine is the way to go.
Before you can connect custom search capabilities to your AdSense account, 
you must first create a custom search engine. Here’s how:
 
1. Point your browser to www.google.com/coop/cse.
 
 The Google Custom Search Engine page appears.
 
2. Click the Create Custom Search Engine button.
 
3. In the new page that appears, enter your username and password in 
the space provided and then click Sign In.
 
 You can use the same username and password you use for your 
AdSense account.
 
4. In the new page that appears, enter the setup information for your 
search engine, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 This information includes
 
• A name and description for your search engine.
 
• Keywords that define the topic of your search engine.
 
• The main language for your search engine.

149
 Chapter 8: Understanding AdSense for Search
 
• Your choice on the scope of the search. You can limit the search 
to specific sites or you can also set up your search so that it either 
searches the whole Web or the whole Web with emphasis on the 
sites that you specify.
 
 If you’ve decided to specify certain sites to be included in your 
search parameters, you can list the specific URLs you want to 
allow in the text box provided. Go ahead and choose as many sites 
as you like. You’re allowed up to 5,000 specific sites, which are 
also called annotations.
 
• The specific edition of the customized search engine you want to 
use. The standard edition is free but requires that you allow ads to 
be shown. The business edition allows you to create a customized 
search engine with no ads.

• An I Have Read and Agree to the Terms of Service check box. 
(Okay, it doesn’t sound much like setting anything up, but if you 
don’t select this check box, you’re stuck in an eternal loop you’ll 
never break out of.)
 
5. After you fill in all the requested information — and agree to the 
terms of service — click the Next button.
 
6. On the second page of the wizard, test your search engine by running 
a test query.
 
 The results from the test are shown on the page, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
7. After you test it, you can select the Send Confirmation Email To . . . 
check box near the bottom of the page to have a confirmation mes-
sage sent to your Inbox.
 
 The confirmation message provides links to additional information and 
capabilities, such as managing your custom search engine. This isn’t 
a required option, but I suggest that you select it for at least the first 
search engine that you create.
 
8. Click Finish to be taken to your main Google Custom Search Engine page.
 
Google Custom Search Engine is a beta program, which means it’s still in the 
testing phases even though it’s available to the general public. Beta programs 
sometimes have glitches or bugs and don’t work exactly as they should, so 
keep your eyes open for anything out of the ordinary and expect changes in 
the future. After the program’s been sufficiently tested and improved, it comes 
out of beta testing and becomes a general release program, which means that 
the glitches and bugs are less likely to occur and updates to the program 
happen less often and on more regular schedules.
Now you have a custom search engine. Just because you have it doesn’t 
mean that you’ll start earning money from it, though. You still need to con-
nect your Custom Search Engine account to your AdSense account before 
you can get paid for the ads that appear on the search results page.
 
1. Point your browser to www.google.com/coop/cse.
 
 The Google Custom Search Engine page appears.
 
2. Click the Manage Your Existing Search Engines link.
 
 If you’re not automatically logged in to your account, you may be 
prompted for your username and password. If needed, enter your e-mail 
address and password in the spaces provided and click Log In.
 
 You’ll be taken to the Manage Search Engines page, as shown in 
Figure 8-6.

 If all the information matches, you receive a confirmation letting you know 
the two accounts are now connected. Being connected simply means that 
your search box not only appears on your page but also sends information 
about ads that appear in search results to your AdSense account. That 
means that when your visitors use your custom search box to search for 
something and then click an ad while they’re viewing the search results, 
you get paid for it just as if you were using an AdSense for Search box.

Now, you may be wondering why in the world you’d go to all this trouble to 
add a customized search engine to your Web site when AdSense has similar 
controls built into the AdSense for Search capability. The answer is: It’s all 
about control.
You can use the AdSense for Search Wizard to customize your search engine — 
specifying whether users can search the Web or other sites, for example, or cus-
tomizing the appearance of the search engine that you make available from your 
site. Those capabilities are limited with AdSense though. (You can only specify 
up to three sites for customized searches, for example.)
If you really want to make an impact with your search engine capabilities, 
using a Google Custom Search Engine is the way to go. You can add more 
Web sites to the SiteSearch capabilities, and you can further customize the 
search engine to reflect your style and the design of your Web site.
 
Many companies or Web site owners that have a large number of pages or 
a complex forum system use the Google Custom Search Engine because it 
makes their site and their site capabilities more valuable to site users. It’s 
really your call though. If there’s no added value in creating a custom engine, 
don’t put the time into it. I’m always an advocate for anything that adds value 
to site visitors because those visitors really do remember (and revisit) the 
sites that they find most useful.
So, that’s it. Now you have a custom search engine connected to your 
AdSense account, providing an additional revenue stream — and you know 
what makes it valuable to you! You can also go back into your Custom Search 
Engine account at any time and tweak the search engine you created by 
changing the Web sites that it searches or even the look of the search engine.
To change the way your custom search engine looks, try this:
 
1. Log in to your custom search engine Control Panel, as outlined in the 
previous steps, and then click the Control Panel link for the search 
engine that you want to customize.
 
 Doing so opens the Control Panel page for that search engine.
 
2. On the Control Panel page, select the Look and Feel link to be taken 
to the Customize Your Search Box page.
 
 On this page, you have several options for changing the appearance of 
your search box, including different logo configurations and color options.
 
3. In the first section of the page, as shown in Figure 8-10, select how you 
want the Google custom search box to appear on your page and then 
click the Save Changes button.

4. In the next section, as shown in Figure 8-11, customize the colors of 
the border, title, background, text, links, visited links, and cached 
links and then click the Save Changes button.
 
 You can do this by choosing the desired colors from the Color Picker — 
the small colored boxes next to each option — or by entering the hexa-
decimal numbers that represent the colors.

5. To add your personalized logo, enter the URL for the logo in the 
Image URL text box, as shown in Figure 8-12.
 
 If you don’t know what the URL is, you can open another browser window 
and go to your Web site. Then right-click the logo of your site and select 
Copy Image Location, flip back to the Google Custom Search Engine cus-
tomization page, and paste the URL into the text box provided.

 You also have the option to link your logo to a specific Web site. For 
example, if you want your logo to appear on the search results page and 
to link back to your main Web site, then enter the main URL for your 
Web site in the Link Logo to URL text box.
 
6. When you’ve entered the logo and link information, click the Save 
Changes button.
 
 The small sample display above the logo and link text boxes displays 
your logo if you choose to use this option.
 
Although all three of these customization options are on one page, you don’t 
have to change them all at the same time. You can change any single option 
on the page without affecting the other options. If you want to change the 
colors, but leave the logo you already have in place, or even leave it off com-
pletely, adjust your color settings and click the Save Changes button, and only 
the changes you actually want will take effect.
Creating an AdSense Search Box
I’m the first to say that custom search engines are pretty cool, but they’re 
not necessary for every Web site. If you don’t need a custom search engine, a 
regular AdSense search box works just fine.
I spend some time earlier in this chapter profiling the wizard that helps you 
create the search box, and filling you in on your options when it comes to speci-
fying the types of searches the AdSense search box can perform. Now I want to 
show you how to create the search box from A to Z — all the way from specify-
ing the kind of search box you want to generating the HTML code you need to 
place on your Web site so you can finally start earning some money from it. It’s 

157
 Chapter 8: Understanding AdSense for Search
not too tough — I’d say it’s fifth-grade-science-project easy — and should take 
you less time than brewing your first cup of coffee in the morning (unless you 
have a Bunn Coffee Maker — those take like three minutes, so you’d have to 
hurry to beat one). Here’s how it’s done:
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com, log on to your AdSense 
account, and then click the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. On the Setup tab, select the AdSense for Search option.
 
 Doing so calls up the AdSense for Search Wizard (refer to Figure 8-1).
 
3. In the Search Type section of page, select the radio button correspond-
ing to the type of search you want the search box to perform: Google 
WebSearch or Google WebSearch + SiteSearch.
 
4. In the Search Box Style section of the page, use the options to custom-
ize the look of your search box.
 
 As Figure 8-13 shows, you have two options for logo styles and several 
different combinations of styles that can change the look of your 
search box.
 
 Your options include
 
• Google Logo: If you select the Logo Above Text Box check box, the 
Google logo appears above the search box. If you leave this box 
deselected, the Google logo appears to the left of the text box.
 
• “Google Search” on Button: Selecting this option ditches the 
Google logo and just puts the Google name on the search button.
 
• Search Button Below Text Box: If you select this check box, the 
Search button (the thing a user clicks to start a search) appears 
under the search box. Otherwise, the button appears to the right 
of the search box.

158
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
 
• Background color and text color: Here you can use a drop-down 
menu to select the color that you want to use as your search box 
background — your choices here are white, black, or gray — as 
well as specify if you want the text to be black or white.
 
• Text box length: Here you can choose the number of characters 
that you want to allow in the search box. The default is 31 charac-
ters, but you can change that to whatever length suits you.
 
5. In the More Options section, select the main language for your search 
box from the drop-down menu.
 
 This setting refers to the language of your Web site. Visitors can choose 
to search in their own native language if it’s different than the one you 
select, but you still have to make a choice from more than 30 selections 
available in the drop-down menu.
 
6. Still in the More Options section of the page, choose the site encoding 
you’ll use for your Web page from the Your Site Encoding drop-down 
menu.
 
 Site encoding here refers to the computer language or code that your site 
is created in. (Even if you’re using HTML, there are several versions of 
it.) The default is set to West European Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1). If you don’t 
know what the encoding for your site is, leave the default in place.
 
7. Select the country your domain is registered in from the Country 
drop-down menu and then click Continue to go to the second page of 
the wizard.
 
 The second page, as shown in Figure 8-14, is where you customize the 
look of your search results page.
 
8. In the second page of the wizard, select the color template you want 
to use for the search results page from the drop-down menu at the 
center-right.
 
 You have six palettes to choose from, but keep in mind that you can skip 
the palettes and just enter hexadecimal numbers for custom colors in 
the appropriate text boxes — Border, Title, Background, for example — 
to precisely match your Web site. (Chapter 7 has more on hexadecimal 
numbers and how you can use them to match the colors of your search 
box to the colors on your Web site.)
 
9. To add your own corporate logo to your search results page, enter the 
URL where the logo is located in the Logo Image URL text box.
 
 Note: If you want your logo to appear above the search box, select the 
Above Search Box check box. Otherwise, the logo appears to the left of 
the box.

10. (Optional) Add a Logo Destination URL.
 
 The Logo Destination URL is optional, but should you decide to use it, 
this will link your logo back to a Web page that you specify. That can be 
the main page of your Web site or any other page that you choose.
 
11. In the More Options section of the screen, as shown in Figure 8-15, 
select where you want the search results to appear.
 
 Your choices here are
 
• On Google, in the Same Window: Opening search results on 
Google in the same window replaces your Web page with the 
Google page. It’s streamlined — no additional windows are opened 
— but it also leads visitors away from your Web site. The concern 
with leading visitors away is that they won’t click back and you’ll 
lose them completely. The tradeoff is that opening the results on 
Google’s pages gives your site visitors confidence that their search 
is being done by the best search engine on the Web.
 
• On Google, in a New Window: Opening search results in a new 
window is an excellent way to ensure that your site remains open 
for users and that the user also feels the confidence that comes 
with seeing Google-logoed pages. A second window (or tab, if you’re 
using a Web browser that supports tabbed browsing) opens with 
the search results, but your Web site also remains open. When users 
finish browsing search results, they can close the window in which 
the search results are displayed, but your Web site will still be open. 
That’s no guarantee that the visitor will continue surfing your site — 
he could close your site, too — but it does leave the possibility that 
he’ll continue surfing through your pages.

160
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
 
• On Your Own Web Site: Opening search results on your Web site 
keeps the user on your site, but also strips away some of the con-
fidence that comes with Google search results. The search results 
are stylized to match your site, but still contain the Google logo. 
They’re just not actual Google pages, which could erode user 
confidence some.

12. If you want to enable site-flavored searches, select the Customize the 
Type of Search Results I Get to My Site Content check box.
 
 Site-flavored search is a progressive technology — meaning that the 
results get more accurate over time — that pulls search results that are 
related to the content of your Web site. In the beginning, search results 
are more general, but over time the results become more refined and 
better related to your site content.
 
13. If you want to use the SafeSearch option, select the Use SafeSearch 
check box.
 
 SafeSearch filters out nearly all the adult content (such as pornography) 
from search results.
 
14. Select a Custom Channel for tracking earning results from the drop-
down menu of custom channels that you’ve created.
 
 Remember, channels are basically a tagging method that allows you to 
track specific ads or groups of ads.
 
15. Select Continue to generate the search box code, as shown in 
Figure 8-16, for pasting into your Web site.

Figure 8-16: 
After you 
complete 
the cus-
tomization 
and click 
Continue, 
the code 
for your 
search box 
displays.
 
Keep in mind when you’re customizing the search results page that you defi-
nitely don’t want to go crazy with all the colors. The last thing you want to do 
is create a kaleidoscope that gives your site visitors headaches.
A better option is to stick to standard design principles and have a single 
color for the background — preferably one that matches the background of 
your Web site — and then use no more than three colors in the foreground. 
For example, if you have a basic white background for your Web site, that 
counts as one color.
Then, you can style your text in black, links that haven’t been clicked as blue, 
and links that have been clicked as red. Including the white background, you 
have four total colors. Four colors won’t jar the user, and your search results 
will still look very professional.
After you generate the code for your search box, copy and paste the code 
onto your Web page in the same way that you copy and paste AdSense for 
Content code. It may take a little tweaking to get the search box in exactly 
the spot you want it, but you can move it around with your HTML editor to 
ensure that it appears in the proper place.

162
Part II: The Major Players: AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search 
One thing you should know about designing your search box is that with the 
customization that’s available, you can change the look of the search box 
completely. You should not, however, change the color of the search button. 
Because it’s Google and people trust Google, they’ll recognize the gray search 
button, and they’re more likely to use it. If you change the search button, visi-
tors could mistake your search box for something belonging to some other 
search company, and their confidence in finding what they’re looking for 
might not be as high.
Adding search capabilities through AdSense makes sense whether you have 
a site of 5 pages or 500. Users may come to your site and find everything they 
need, but if they don’t, they’ll go somewhere to search out the answers they 
seek. Give them a search box linked directly from your site, and you’ll not 
only help them out, but you might gain a little financial reward in the process.
AdSense for Search and WordPress
In many ways, WordPress is different from 
other kinds of blogging programs. At its core, 
WordPress is a good blogging program; but 
because it’s so customizable at the code level, it 
has much more power than other blogging appli-
cations. That also happens to mean that some 
things just aren’t as easy with WordPress.
Installing an AdSense search box in Blogger is 
pretty straightforward. You create the search 
box in AdSense, copy the code, and use an 
HTML widget to insert it in your blog. With 
WordPress, the process is much more difficult 
and requires that you edit the core code of 
the WordPress blog page where you want the 
search box to appear.
Here’s an easier way — MightySearch is a 
WordPress plugin from MightyHitter (www.
mightyhitter.com) that’s designed to 
let you paste in your AdSense for Search code 
and it will make the code work properly on your 
WordPress blog. The plugin handles all the 
details that could take you forever to figure out 
if you’re not a WordPress genius.
Adding search capabilities to your site just 
makes sense. Chances are that you won’t have 
every detail that your site visitors are looking for 
on your Web site. Why not make it easy for them 
to find what you don’t have? In the process, 
you can add to your AdSense revenue stream. 
Nothing wrong with making some money on the 
information you don’t have on your site, too.

V
ideo is one of the top technologies online right now. Everyone’s watch-
ing, downloading, streaming, or creating it. You find video on a majority 
of pages, and several services — including YouTube, GodTube, and Google 
Video — make it possible for people to create and upload videos of interest 
as well as find, watch, and/or download said videos.
No wonder AdSense is trying to tap into the video market. The popularity 
of online video is almost as mind-boggling as the popularity of blogs or 
podcasts or any other newer technology that no one expected to fly but 
is taking the Web by storm. The draw is entertainment. The content 
changes constantly and there are so many different types of video — 
from those created by amateurs to professional documentaries to full-
length television shows and movies — that there’s something to keep 
everyone busy.
Add to the availability of a wide variety of videos the fact that Internet users 
are logging on through broadband services more and more frequently, and 
you have a mix that just works for video. To take advantage of it, AdSense is 
monetizing videos in more ways than one, as this chapter makes clear.

166
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
When it comes to AdSense, consider another technology along with video: 
AdSense for Google Gadgets. Google Gadgets are cool little programs and 
downloads folks come up with that you can add to your Web site, blog, or 
desktop that help you do stuff faster. For example, Google hosts a whole slew 
of gadgets created by third parties that you can add to your iGoogle page — 
your personalized Google page — that help you accomplish tasks faster. I 
have an iGoogle page that features things like dictionaries, calculators, and 
weather reports.
If you have some software-writing skills and can come up with your own 
gadgets, you should strongly consider embedding AdSense ads into your gad-
gets as one way to monetize the gadgets you create to share with others. If 
you have a popular gadget like Weather Forecast by LabPixies or MP3 Player 
by Mike Duffy, it could be a very lucrative way to create more AdSense 
revenue.
Video and AdSense: Choosing 
the Right Product
AdSense, in its ongoing drive to be as accommodating as possible, actually 
has three options available for video. Each of these options is targeted to a 
different aspect of video — aspects that reach both those who create videos 
and those who want to advertise on a text site with video. The three types of 
video are
 
 Click-to-play video ads: Video ads are a type of ad displayed on your 
Web site. You must opt into image ads when you create your first 
AdSense for Content ads and use one of the supported formats to add 
click-to-play video ads to your site. The supported formats are
 
• 336x280 (Large rectangle)
 
• 300x250 (Medium rectangle)
 
• 250x250 (Square)
 
• 200x200 (Small square)
 
• 728x90 (Leaderboard)
 
• 120x600 (Skyscraper)
 
• 160x600 (Wide skyscraper)

167
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
 
 Video units: This feature allows you to add video content from YouTube 
partners to your Web site in a customizable player. The video comes 
to you packaged with text overlay ads and a companion banner above 
the video — that’s the AdSense part. Note: You must have an English-
language site to use AdSense video units.
 
 AdSense for Video: This product delivers text overlay and InVideo ads 
into your existing video streams. (InVideo ads are ads that actually play 
within videos that are embedded on your Web site.) If you have your 
own online video content, AdSense for Video can help you earn revenue 
from that content. The rub here is that AdSense for Video is in beta 
testing, so it’s only available to a limited number of users at this time. It 
shouldn’t be long (maybe even before you finish reading this chapter) 
before it’s open to the general public, though.
All three of these options are viable for different types of AdSense users, and 
each has different uses and capabilities. How do you know which one to use 
for your site? That depends on how you want your site visitors to interact 
with the ads. (To some extent, it also depends on whether AdSense lets you 
use a certain type of video ad, but I get to that in a bit.)
Click-to-play
Click-to-play ads actually take the place of graphic ads on your site, but you 
can’t control when that happens. You place a compatible graphic ad on your 
Web site, and when AdSense has a click-to-play video ad that fits your site, 
it’s shown in place of the static ad. The videos don’t show all the time, and 
there is currently no way to make videos replace static images all the time. 
See, it’s based on the availability of videos that are appropriate to your site, 
but AdSense may not always have advertisers placing ads that match your 
site. It’s only when there are matching video ads that your content ads will 
be replaced.
The ad formats that accommodate these click-to-play ads are
 
 336x280 (Large rectangle)
 
 300x250 (Medium rectangle)
 
 250x250 (Square)
 
 200x200 (Small square)
 
 728x90 (Leaderboard)

168
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
 120x600 (Skyscraper)
 
 160x600 (Wide skyscraper)
If you already have one of these ads sizes on your Web site, but it’s not 
image-enabled — meaning it’s a text only ad — you can edit the settings 
under the Manage Ads option. To edit existing ads, follow these steps:
 
1. Log into your AdSense account and go to the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. Click the Manage Ads link.
 
 The Manage Ads screen displays a list of the ads you have available, as 
shown in Figure 9-1.

4. Use the Format drop-down menu (indicated in Figure 9-2) to select 
either Text and Image Ads or Image Ads Only.
 
5. Click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the page.
 
 Within a couple of hours, your ads should be showing images, which can 
then be replaced by videos when they are available.

Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
Video units
Video units are ads that are partnered with YouTube videos. Such ads are 
displayed within your YouTube videos — both videos that you’ve created 
and videos that others have created that you have embedded on your Web 
site — in a couple different ways within the video player. They appear both as 
a banner at the top of the video player and as a pop-up link within the video 
player, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Video units 
give viewers 
two places 
from which 
to click 
an ad.
 
If you don’t use videos on your site, this type of ad might be a little out of 
place in the beginning. If you’re using video on your site already, the integra-
tions of video units are relatively smooth, and it’s a great way to monetize 
the video content that your visitors are accustomed to.
 
Keep in mind that you have to have an active YouTube account to use this 
type of video ad and you also have to link your YouTube account to your 
AdSense account.
It only takes a few steps to link the two accounts:
 
1. Open two browser windows and then log in to your YouTube account 
in one window and your AdSense account in the other.
 
2. In the window in which you have your AdSense account open, go to 
the AdSense Setup tab and then choose Video Units as the product.
 
 Basically, act as if you’re setting up a video unit for your Web site.

171
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
 
3. When you get to the Video Setup page, click the Visit AdSense Video 
Units button.
 
 Doing so takes you to the YouTube site, where you’re prompted to con-
nect your YouTube account and your AdSense account.
 
4. If you already have a YouTube account and are signed in, verify your 
linkage request by entering the e-mail address, phone number, and 
postal code associated with your account.
 
 This is why you signed in to both your YouTube account and your 
AdSense account in the first step.
 
5. After you enter this information, click the Submit Confirmation button.
 
 If you don’t have a YouTube account, you’re prompted to sign up for 
one. After you’ve created the account, the steps to connect the two 
accounts are the same as above.
 
 After you click the Submit Confirmation button, your accounts will be 
connected. Then you can return to your AdSense account to begin set-
ting up video units.
AdSense for Video
AdSense for Video is the newest addition to the video family for AdSense. So 
new, in fact, that it’s still in beta testing, and is only available to a certain number 
of participants. To be selected, you also have to meet certain restrictions:
 
 You must have a Flash 7 player that you can control.
 
 You must have 1,000,000 or more monthly streams — that’s a million 
times a month that your video is viewed by site visitors. Don’t let the 
number scare you. It’s not all that uncommon for a popular YouTube 
video to get a million or more views in a month’s time.
 
 You must be a U.S.-based Web site owner who publishes AdSense ads on 
your site and you must have a (primarily) U.S. viewership.
If you meet these requirements and want to display AdSense for Video ads, 
you also need to fill out a sign-up form (as shown in Figure 9-4) and wait to be 
accepted into the program. You can find the form at this URL: www.google.
com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?contact_type=video_
joinbeta.
When you do get accepted into the program, AdSense for Video allows you to 
place ads in your own streaming video. This is especially useful if you create 
and share videos on your Web site and other sites.

Figure 9-4:

Ads can appear in one of two places in your video. Ads can be displayed 
InVideo, as shown in Figure 9-5, which means that the ads actually appear 
within the window where the video displays.
 
Figure 9-5: 
InVideo ads 
are actually

The alternative is to display ads as text overlays, as shown in Figure 9-6.
The cool thing about InVideo ads is that they’re essentially a video within a 
video. The ads play in the lower one-third of the video player you’ve embed-
ded on your site, and they’re short — usually not more than 60 seconds. 

173
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
While the ad is showing, the video that should be playing in the player is 
paused. Then, when the ad is finished, the area in which it is displayed 
shrinks back but still displays a link to the advertiser. The video that you 
have set to play should then begin on its own.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Text overlay 
ads are the 
alternative 
in AdSense 
for Video.
 
Text overlay ads don’t contain any actual video. They are simple text ads 
that overlay the lower one-third of the player. Your video plays as usual but 
the link remains available throughout the whole video.
There is no inherent advantage to one type of ad over the other — InVideo or 
Text Overlay. It’s mostly a personal choice that should be governed by what 
you and your visitors prefer. I strongly recommend that you try each configu-
ration separately for the same amount of time and then compare results to 
see which option your Web site audience likes best.
Enabling Click-to-Play Capabilities
Putting AdSense video capabilities into place on your Web site differs a little 
with each different type of video capability AdSense offers. The simplest path 
to take involves using click-to-play video ads, whereas AdSense for Video is 
definitely a bit trickier.
Implementing click-to-play video ads is as simple as choosing the right format 
(large rectangle, square, wide skyscraper, and so on) and enabling graphic 
ad displays. Choosing the right format for video ads isn’t actually part of the 
video setup that AdSense offers but is part of the AdSense for Content setup 
(see Chapter 5).

174
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
If you made your way through Chapter 5, this choosing-an-ad-format business 
sounds familiar. Here’s the shorthand version:
 
1. Point your browser to www.adsense.com, log on to your AdSense 
account, and then click the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. On the AdSense Setup tab select AdSense for Content.
 
 The AdSense for Content Wizard appears.
 
3. In the first section of the wizard, select the Ad Unit radio button and 
then select either Text and Image Ads or Image Ads Only from the 
drop-down menu to the right, as shown in Figure 9-7.
 
Figure 9-7: 
Select 
one of the 
options from 
the drop-
down menu 
to show 
images in 
your ads.
 
Choose an image ad option here.
Continue to set up the ad as I show you in Chapter 5. When you’re finished, 
copy and paste the code into your Web site, and you’re all set. All that 
remains is to wait for AdSense to place a click-to-play ad on your site.
You have no control over what videos get placed beyond enabling the 
graphic format that click-to-play video ads require. Ads are placed when 
they’re appropriate for your site.
 
Earning with click-to-play ads is the same as earning with other AdSense for 
Content ads. Site visitors must click the ad and be taken to the advertiser’s 
Web site for you to earn your payment on the ad.

175
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
When you get right down to it, nothing much different is going on in click-to-
play video ads. You create and add the code for your ads in the same way you 
do for AdSense for Content ads. The only real difference is in the way the ad 
displays. If you’re looking to draw a little more attention to your ads, this video 
format might be a good way to go about it. You can’t blend video ads as well 
into your Web site as you can text ads, however, so test any video ads before 
you commit to replacing text ads that have already proven how they perform.
Getting Started with Video Units
Video units are a little more complicated than click-to-play ads. Video units 
are actually ads shown along with YouTube videos that are displayed in a 
specialized player you’ve added to your Web site.
You do have some control over what videos you choose to show in your 
player. You can select the video content you want by picking content catego-
ries, by selecting individual content providers, or by having video automati-
cally targeted to your site content.
Before you can do any of that, however, you have to have a YouTube account 
that’s connected to your Web site.
Signing up with YouTube
YouTube is a video-sharing service that’s owned by Google. With YouTube, 
anyone can upload and share videos with others. Or, if you’re not the video-
shooting-and-sharing kind of person, you can browse YouTube videos to find 
things that interest you. Since I’ve been using YouTube, I’ve watched movie 
spoofs, instructional videos, and even sermons from church services. What 
you watch is directed by your taste in videos.
You can also find videos and add them to your Web site or blog. You don’t 
actually download the video and then store it on your Web server; instead, 
you paste the code for a special URL into the code of your blog or Web site, 
and the video is streamed from YouTube to your site whenever someone 
comes to your site and starts the video.
In order to take advantage of all the fun, you do need to sign up for a 
YouTube account, which is a simple process. Start by going to the YouTube 
Web site at www.youtube.com. After you’re there, click the Sign Up link in 
the upper-right corner of the page. You see a simple form, like the one shown 
in Figure 9-8. Fill it out, click the Sign Up button, and then wait for YouTube 
to send you a confirmation e-mail. After you get your e-mail, respond to it to 
create a YouTube account that you can use with AdSense.

for YouTube,

information 
in the sign-
up form.
 
A note about the YouTube Partner program
YouTube has a Partner program that you can also use to monetize your 
YouTube videos. With the YouTube partner program, you can allow ads 
that are controlled by YouTube. Keep in mind, though, that you don’t have 
as much control over them as you would with a standard AdSense ad. The 
ads are chosen for you, based on the videos that you choose to place on 
YouTube. That means that you won’t necessarily be displaying the ads — 
other people will, when they display videos that you have uploaded to the 
YouTube service. This program can be a little confusing, and although it’s 
not required for you to use video units with AdSense — in fact, the YouTube 
Partner program is a completely different entity than AdSense for Video — I 
want to take a minute to discuss its quirkier aspects.
To start with, signing up for the Partner program isn’t difficult, per se. To 
sign up, fill out another form (see Figure 9-9) on the YouTube Web site (www.
youtube.com/partners).

177
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
 
Figure 9-9: 
Fill out and 
submit this 
form to be 
considered 
for the 
YouTube 
Partner 
program.
 
The problem with this process isn’t in the Filling Out Yet Another Form part 
or the Time You Spend Waiting to Find Out If You’ve Been Accepted into the 
Program part. The problem lies in the requirements to be accepted. To be 
accepted into the YouTube Partner program, you must meet the following 
criteria:
 
 You must create and upload original videos suitable for online streaming.
 
 You must own (or have express permission to use and monetize) all 
audio and video content that you upload — no exceptions.
 
 You must regularly upload videos that are viewed by thousands of 
YouTube users.
 
 You must live in the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom.

178
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
In all, the only real issue is with the third point: You must regularly upload 
videos that are viewed by thousands of YouTube users. If you’re new 
to YouTube, you’re not likely to meet this criterion, so you may not be 
approved for the YouTube Partner program, which is frustrating when you 
want to start using AdSense video units immediately.
If you do meet the criteria and you’re accepted into the YouTube Partner pro-
gram, you have yet another method for monetizing your YouTube videos — in 
addition to using AdSense for Video. There is one little confusing part, though.
If you have more than one YouTube account, you could find yourself in AdSense-
connection hell! In an effort to get out of that fiery Neverland, you may find that 
you’re clicking from your AdSense account into your YouTube account, only to 
be sent back to your AdSense account again as you try to connect the two.
 
Make very sure you’re logged in to your AdSense account and your YouTube 
account with the exact same e-mail address before you begin the connection 
process. If you’re not, you’ll be running in circles for hours trying to figure out 
what you’ve done wrong. Take my advice on this, folks. I spent nearly a whole 
day trying to figure out what I was doing wrong!
Creating your first video player
 
If you’ve made it this far, you deserve a medal. I don’t give you one, though; 
instead, I show you how to create your first video player.
I make the assumption here that you’ve already connected your YouTube 
account to your AdSense account, as I describe in the previous section. 
That means you’ve received a nice confirmation message praising you for 
your successful linking of your YouTube and AdSense accounts. If you scroll 
down a bit in that message, you also see a line informing you that You Have 
Not Created Any AdSense Players Yet. Next to that little bit of info you see a 
Create AdSense Player button. Guess what I ask you to do?
 
1. Click the Create AdSense Player button.
 
 The New AdSense Player page appears, as shown in Figure 9-10. Use this 
page to build a customized AdSense player for your Web site.
 
2. In the New AdSense Player page, enter a name for your AdSense 
player and, if you like, a short description in the text boxes provided.
 
 Although the name and description are shown only to you, still enter some-
thing that helps you remember the purpose of the player, rather than some 
smart-alecky name whose meaning you might forget in a month or two.
 
3. In the Theme section of the New AdSense Player page, select a color 
scheme for your player.
 
 Make it something that matches well with your Web site.

 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
 
Figure 9-10: 
Give your

player a

description 
to help you 
recognize it.
 
 
4. In the Layout section of the page, choose a size that best suits your site.
 
 Your choices here are Mini, Standard, and Full Size.
 
5. After you finish making your selections, scroll farther down the page 
to make selections for what content you want to display in your 
AdSense video player, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
 You can choose to either let YouTube automatically populate your 
player with content, which is done by keywords — you enter the most 
relevant keywords for your site — or if you’re like me and want more 
control, you can choose from a list of categories or individual providers 
that will be used to populate the player.
 
6. After you make your selections, scroll to the bottom of the page and 
click the Generate Code button to get the code for your Web site.
 
 When the page reloads, you’ll have to scroll to the bottom of it to copy 
the code that’s provided.
All that’s left is to install the code on your Web site and then videos are fed 
directly into the AdSense player.
 
You’re not limited to a single AdSense player on your Web site. You are, 
however, limited to one per page. If you want to create new players for other 
pages on your site, click the Create Player button on the left side of the 
screen when you log in to AdSense Video Units. Each player that you’ve 
created is then displayed on the Video Units page so that you can access it 
for deleting or editing at any time.

Installing the code
Installing the code for the AdSense player is exactly like installing any other 
AdSense code on your Web site. First highlight and copy the code and then 
paste it into the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for your Web site, 
between the <body> and </body> tags.
 
After you upload your Web site code to the server, your video units should 
begin showing immediately, although in some rare cases, you could experi-
ence a short delay. If your ads aren’t showing within about an hour of having 
uploaded the new site with the AdSense code included, contact AdSense to 
see if you’ve done something wrong.
Earning with video units
Your earnings with video units aren’t much different from the earnings that 
you generate with other types of AdSense ad units. The difference is all in the 
display.

181
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
With video units, you have two opportunities to earn from your placement. 
The first involves the banner-type ads that appear at the top of the video 
player, and the second comes from the text overlay ads that appear on the 
bottom 20 percent of the video player. When your site visitors click either of 
these ads, you get paid.
Some video units also have the cost-per-impression model — also called 
a cost-per-thousand-impression model because payment is based on the 
number of times an ad or video is viewed, divided by 1,000 — which means 
all that’s necessary for you to get some earnings out of this is for someone 
to view the video. Like all cost-per-impression ads, those are doled out by 
AdSense to sites that generate very high levels of traffic and stringently meet 
the requirements that advertisers have set forth.
You never know for sure when cost-per-impression ads are displayed, so all 
you can do is steadily build your Web site traffic and hope that they’re dis-
played when you’re having a nice spike in traffic. If you do happen to notice 
when a cost-per-impression ad is displayed, you can always try to drive traf-
fic to your site. You never know how long the ad remains on your site though, 
so whatever efforts you take should be ones that have quick results.
Reports for video units
After you connect your AdSense and YouTube accounts, a new report appears 
on your Reports page. This report is for the video units, and it shows the same 
information for video units that you see for other types of AdSense ads:
 
 Page impressions
 
 Clicks
 
 Page click-through-rate (CTR)
 
 Page cost-per-thousand impressions
 
 Earnings
You have the same capabilities with this report that you have with any of the 
other earnings reports that AdSense makes available, including the ability 
to generate the report regularly and have it e-mailed to you. (For more on 
AdSense reports, see Chapter 15.)
If you’re already using video on your Web site or blog, AdSense video units 
are a good way to monetize on that video. After you work your way through 
the confusing parts, you can add video with the click of a few buttons. The 
earnings potential is there, so get started with it.

182
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
Go, Go Google Gadgets
If you’ve ever seen a personalized Google home page, you’ve seen Google 
Gadgets in action. Google Gadgets are basically little programs that you (or 
someone else) put together and upload to the Google Gadgets collection. 
Users can then download those gadgets and add them to their iGoogle home 
page or even to their Google desktop application.
Some serious confusion exists about how Google Gadgets works with AdSense, 
though, and I clear that up for you. First, a little more about Google Gadgets, 
what they do, and how they’re created.
What’s a gadget?
Google Gadgets are mini-applications that are created with XML, HTML, 
or JavaScript. When you create a Google Gadget, it can do anything from 
display the weather forecast to show you the Bible verse of the day or con-
nect you to a useful service on a company’s Web page. One example is the 
Wikipedia Gadget, which sits on your iGoogle page and shows a search box 
for Wikipedia. To perform a search, type your search string into the search 
box, click Search, and you’re taken to the correct Wikipedia page. Cool, huh?
Gadgets are an excellent way to turn users onto your products and services 
by giving them a sneak peak at what you have to offer. Gadgets can be in 
the form of calculators, search boxes, useful tools, or whatever it is that you 
have to offer. The thing to remember as you plan to create a Google Gadget is 
that the more useful or entertaining it is, the more people will download and 
install the gadget, which is the key to monetizing your gadgets.
When you create gadgets, think creatively about the audience that you want 
to serve. What does that audience want that doesn’t already exist? When you 
hit that sweet spot, you’ll know you’ve come up with the right idea by the 
number of downloads of your gadgets.
Creating a gadget
If you have an idea for a gadget that you think will be wildly popular, create 
it. You can create gadgets in XML, HTML, or JavaScript. Creating gadgets is 
all about how you format the code that makes the gadget work.
Don’t be discouraged if you don’t know XML or JavaScript, though. If you 
know some basic HTML, Google provides all the additional information that 
you need to create a gadget with the Google Gadgets Editor (GGE). You use 

183
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
this program to write the code for the gadget. Alternatively, you can use any 
text editor that you’re comfortable with, but GGE is specifically designed for 
you to work with gadgets.
To access GGE, log in to http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/
docs/gs.html#GGE and scroll to the bottom of the page. That’s where the 
editor, as shown in Figure 9-12, makes its home — until you offer it a new 
home on your computer.
 
Figure 9-12: 
The Google 
Gadgets 
Editor is 
where you 
can create 
your first 
gadgets.
 
One of the most basic gadgets that you can create is the same program that 
everyone starts with when they’re figuring out how to program an HTML site 
of any kind — Hello, world!
Hello, world! is a very simple program to write and requires only a few 
lines of code, such as:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<Module>
<ModulePrefs title=”hello world example” />
<Content type=”html”>
<![CDATA[Hello, world!]]></Content>
</Module>
I explain this line by line as follows:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
The first line is a standard opening line of code that tells any proces-
sor reading it that a program’s coming, and it’s written in this language 
with that protocol. In this case, the language is XML version 1.0, and the 
encoding protocol is UTF-8.
<Module>

184
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
The <module> tag indicates that a program — the gadget — is within the 
program.
<ModulePrefs title=”hello world example” />
The third line is the module preferences tag, which indicates information 
about the module, such as the title, the author, and other optional fea-
tures that might need to be taken into consideration.
<Content type=”html”>
Just as it reads, this line tells you what the type of content for the gadget 
is. In this case, the content type is HTML (which is why you can get away 
with not knowing XML or JavaScript). If you can use the tags here to get 
started and you know HTML, then you can use HTML as your content 
type and write your gadget using HTML code.
<![CDATA[Hello, world!]]></Content>
The <![CDATA> tag is used to enclose HTML when a gadget’s content 
type is HTML. This tag tells the browser that reads the code that the 
text within the CDATA section shouldn’t be treated as XML. The CDATA 
section typically contains HTML and JavaScript. </Content>, or the 
closing tag, is another part to this line. The closing tag — in this case, the 
</Content> closing tag — indicates where the content for the module 
ends and is a signal that the program information is complete.
</Module>
Here’s another closing tag. This one indicates that the module is 
complete.
With that, you’re finished. This is a very simple gadget, but when done prop-
erly, it appears like the one shown in Figure 9-13.
 
Figure 9-13: 
The Hello, 
world! 
gadget is as 
simple as 
it gets.
 

185
 Chapter 9: Show Me Some Video (& Other Gadgets)
If you play with it some more, you can tweak it considerably. For example, 
Figure 9-14 shows what I did with some very simple HTML tags.
 
Figure 9-14: 
Play with 
the HTML 
a little and 
you can 
change 
Hello, 
world! as 
desired.
 
Obviously, you’ll want to do something a little more sophisticated than a 
simple Hello, world! message, but I want to give you a feel for how easy it 
is to work with Google Gadgets.
I’m sure you’re wondering where AdSense comes into this mix, though, right? 
It’s simple. AdSense doesn’t have a module specifically for Google Gadgets. 
However, you can program your AdSense ads directly into Google Gadgets.
Programming your AdSense ads into Google Gadgets is just like creating a 
Google AdSense for Content ad. Generate the ad by using the same steps that 
you would if you were putting the ad directly into the content on your Web 
site, and then insert the AdSense code into your gadget code. (If you skipped 
straight to this chapter and you don’t know how to create a content ad, you 
can jump to Chapter 5 where I address that.) You may have to play with it a 
little to get the styles and placement just right, but the end result is a gadget 
that includes an AdSense ad for everyone to see.
Except for one small problem . . .
Creating gadgets sounds simple enough, and if doing so with AdSense ads 
piques your interest, you’ll probably want to do a little more studying on the 
topic because it’s more involved than I make it sound here. You can read 
more about it by going to the Google Gadgets Web site at http://code.
google.com/apis/gadgets.

186
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
There’s one small issue of which you might want to be aware upfront. When 
you’re creating a Google Gadget with the intent of embedding Google AdSense 
code into it, you first need permission from AdSense. AdSense doesn’t usually 
have a problem with granting that permission, but without it, your ad probably 
won’t show up properly in the gadget.
To get permission, you have to e-mail Google AdSense with their support form 
found at www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py. Enter 
your contact information in the form, and then, in the text box provided for 
questions or statements, write a brief request to use AdSense in your gadget.
If you already have an active gadget that is popular, be sure to include informa-
tion about it. If you’re creating a new gadget, include that information too. And 
don’t forget a description of your gadget. Google will make the determination 
to allow you to use AdSense in your gadget on a case-by-case basis.
You may have to wait a few days to get a response from AdSense, so think a 
little ahead of the game if you’re trying to meet a specific deadline.
Another issue to keep in mind when you’re creating your gadgets with 
AdSense embedded in them is that the combination of the two isn’t some-
thing that Google came up with, so there are times when gadgets and 
AdSense don’t play well together.
This can result in either the gadget that you’ve created not being shown or 
the AdSense ad not being shown. There’s no known fix for this issue right 
now. Google’s working on it, so you’ll see that your ads and gadgets display 
well for a time and then they’ll crash. This is the nature of the beast, so be 
prepared with alternative plans (maybe for a gadget without ads) in the event 
that one program ticks off the other.
Ultimately, even without AdSense, Google Gadgets are a great investment 
of your time because they’re a quick and easy way to draw a lot of users to 
your site — especially if you can nail down your audience and provide a truly 
useful gadget. If you can combine AdSense with your gadgets, you’ve really 
created a winning combination.

L
ook around on any given day and you’ll probably see a few dozen people 
using their cell phones. Most will be talking on them, but you’ll also find 
plenty who are texting or even using the Internet.
Despite its smaller format and scaled-down capabilities, the mobile Internet 
is gaining a lot of traction, especially among younger — Generation X and 
Generation Y — users. These kids are always on the go, and they grab what 
they’re looking for from the Internet while they’re in mid-stride. (Unlike me — 
I’m a little more “mature” and find it difficult to read the screen on the phone, 
much less search the Web!)
This younger generation also has a larger disposable income than adults — 
folks who have mortgages, car payments, and credit card bills to think 
about, not to mention the cost of providing disposable income to the 
younger generation!
If that disposable income is available, why wouldn’t you want to tap into it? 
Most Web site owners do feel that urge, so they’ve created mobile-friendly 
Web sites that allow cell phone-enabled Internet users to access their con-
tent whether those visitors are sitting on the bus or climbing the Rocky 
Mountains. Of course, with mobile Web sites, Google will find a way to mon-
etize these mobile-friendly sites.
Enter Google AdSense for Mobile, which is a program that allows you to put 
ads on your Web site that can be displayed on mobile browsers. Visitors surf-
ing your site with a mobile phone can see and click these ads, and you can 
earn some bucks even in this smaller format.

188
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
Trying to harvest a bit of cash from mobile users does require some changes 
to your Web site, though, and it also requires that you scale down some 
AdSense strategies. Think small, in other words, but don’t freak. Thinking 
small doesn’t require too much retooling. This chapter contains what you 
need to know to target those mobile surfers and add another stream to your 
AdSense revenues.
The Differences of Mobility
Nearly half of all mobile Internet users use mobile Web sites only to find 
tidbits of immediately useful information. Mobile surfers don’t usually surf 
just for the fun of being on the Internet — they save major surfing for when 
they can sit at a computer and see pages displayed more than a few words 
at a time. In part, that’s because mobile Web sites are usually pretty poorly 
designed still, despite the fact that the mobile Web has been around for 
awhile now.
It’s hard to get the hang of how a Web site should appear on a cell phone 
screen. Many Web site owners make the mistake of designing their Web site 
for the computer screen and then enabling it for mobile phones without 
changing site design. You can do that, but the results won’t be the most 
useful site a mobile surfer comes across.
Enabling your site for mobile users is easy — for the most part. In most 
cases, it requires a small switch in the encoding of your Web site from HTML 
(HyperText Markup Language) to XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup 
Language) or another mobile-enabled Web design language.
Some mobile applications, however, require PHP — hypertext processor (I 
have no clue how the popular acronym gained the first P). PHP is a server-
side processing language because scripts (or applications) are run from the 
server rather than from the computer that the application appears on. This 
makes it much easier to have rich programming on Web sites, which doesn’t 
depend on the computer a visitor may be using.
Because of the way it works, PHP makes creating rich, detailed mobile Web 
sites a much easier process. The cool part is that if you have a Web site writ-
ten in HTML or XHTML, changing it to PHP is often as easy as changing the 
extension of the files that make up the site from .htm to .php. Really.
Well, okay, it sounds easy enough. Now for a reality check — I’ve seriously 
oversimplified the considerations that go into creating mobile Web sites. The 
fact remains that if your site is built for display on a computer screen, mobile 
users won’t have the same experience. For example, Figure 10-1 shows how 
a list of links might look on a mobile Web page. Keep in mind that there’s no 
mouse on a mobile phone, so users have to scroll through every link on the 
page until they get to the one they want to follow.

189
 Chapter 10: AdSense for Mobile
 
Figure 10-1: 
Links on a 
Web site 
may look 
something 
like this on 
a mobile 
browser.
 
Simply changing the extension on an existing site built for the Internet also 
doesn’t do justice to the pages that display on mobile phones. Much of the 
graphics and functionality of the site is lost during the translation to a mobile 
format, so while the extension change allows you to quickly enable the text 
and links on your site for mobility, it doesn’t make the site pretty or even 
completely useful.
The hardware restraints faced by most mobile users also create serious 
issues. You have to go into creating a Web site with the thought of making it 
available to the largest audience possible. That’s just a fact of mobile life, and 
as more and more mobile adoptions take place, the mobile surfer is more of a 
consideration. That means making your site friendly for both mobile and non-
mobile surfers.
Mobile content is different
When you’re considering a mobile surfer as part of the audience for your site, 
keep in mind the different uses for the mobile Web. Google has done a lot of 
research in this area and has defined three types of mobile surfers:
 
 Repetitive Now: This is the group of mobile surfers who have a set 
of online activities that they conduct from their phones on a regular 
basis. Some of the repetitive tasks these surfers perform are checking 
the weather, reading news stories and blog posts, and checking stock 
quotes.

190
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
 Bored Now: The Bored Now group of Web surfers have a few minutes 
of downtime and don’t know what else to do in such a short amount of 
time. Out comes the phone, and the Web browser is opened to occupy 
their minds for just a few minutes. This type of mobile surfer is probably 
the most targeted because this is the only area where true e-commerce 
dollars can be captured. Bored Now surfers are selecting ringtones, 
downloading videos, and adding themes to their phones.
 
 Urgent Now: “We need it right now” is the motto of this group of mobile 
surfers. These people are booking, changing, or checking airline flights, 
booking hotel rooms, finding directions, or locating restaurants. They 
need information now, so they pull out their phones to find it.
As you consider these three types of mobile surfers, think about which group 
you’re targeting because the group determines whether AdSense ads will 
even be acknowledged by these users. The Repetitive Now group and the 
Bored Now group might click your ads. Unless there’s something very com-
pelling about them, the Urgent Now group is likely to pass right by an ad and 
go straight for the information they seek.
Mobile requirements
Mobile content is definitely different from the content that you find on other 
Web pages, and because it is, participation in AdSense for Mobile has some 
different requirements. Obviously, the Web site must be mobile-compliant, 
but it also must be developed with a server-side scripting language, such as 
PHP. If you’re not sure what PHP is, check out “The Differences of Mobility” 
section earlier in this chapter to find out more about it.
 
If your mobile site isn’t developed with a server-side scripting language, 
AdSense for Mobile ad code doesn’t display properly on your pages. The code 
generated for AdSense for Mobile doesn’t render properly on a normal Web 
site, either, so don’t generate the code thinking that you can fool Google into 
believing that you’re supporting mobile Web sites. All you’ll wind up doing is 
generating an obvious error that your site visitors can see.
Here are some of the mobile Web page markup languages that can be used to 
program your Web site and still have mobile ads enabled:
 
 WML (WAP 1.x): WML, or wireless markup language, is a programming 
language that’s based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and is 
designed specifically for creating Web sites and applications for mobile 
devices.
 
 XHTML (WAP 2.0): eXtensible HyperText Markup Language is an intersec-
tion of HTML and XML, meaning that it’s useful for both normal Web 
sites and mobile Web sites.

191
 Chapter 10: AdSense for Mobile
 
 CHTML (imode): Compact HTML is an alternative to WML and XHTML, 
but it was designed specifically for Japanese cell phones and even more 
specifically for one manufacturer’s products — the Japanese company 
DoCoMo — and the imode phone designation just indicates an Internet 
enabled device. So this isn’t a markup language that has a wide usage 
outside Japan.
I know this is all pretty complicated, but it really is necessary to program 
your mobile Web site using a supported mobile scripting language if you 
want your site to be both functional and useful. Users aren’t likely to return 
to a site that’s nothing more than text and links. If you plan to have a mobile 
site, you should make it as functional and useful as possible. If you want to 
find out more about mobile scripting languages, check out Next Generation 
Wireless Applications: Creating Mobile Applications in a Web 2.0 and Mobile 
2.0 World, by Paul Golding (Wiley Publishing), or Wireless Markup Language 
(WML) Scripting and Programming Using WML, cHTML, and xHTML, by William 
Routt (Althos Publishing).
 
In the preceding list, there’s another abbreviation that I haven’t explained 
yet — WAP. Wireless application protocol is a standard that’s used to sim-
plify how a browser sees a Web site so that mobile browsers can access the 
Internet. The protocol is automatically built into the programming language 
that you’re using to create your mobile Web site. So WML sites automatically 
adhere to the protocol WAP 1.0 and higher. XHTML is designed to work with 
the protocol WAP 2.0 and higher.
In addition to the actual software language requirements that AdSense sets 
forth, ad placement, behavior, and accessibility guidelines are as follows:
 
 You can display only one ad unit per mobile Web page.
 
 A double ad unit — an ad unit that displays two different advertisers’ 
links — can be placed only on the bottom of the page but can be 
located above the page’s footer (including navigational links and 
copyright messages).
 
 Ads displayed on a mobile Web page may not be modified or obscured 
in any way.
 
 After an ad has been clicked, the landing page display may not be inter-
rupted or prevented in any way. For instance, you can’t display any 
other pages — including other advertisements — before taking users 
to the advertiser’s Web site.
 
 The Google crawlers must be able to access your mobile Web sites for 
targeting purposes. If the crawler can’t access your site, ads won’t be 
displayed on your mobile pages.

192
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
If you’re truly interested in creating a mobile Web site and you have content 
that will support mobile users, monetize the site as much as possible. These 
guidelines help you to do just that — put the right content in front of mobile 
surfers so you can take advantage of mobile ad revenues. That process is 
only slightly different than the one used for setting up AdSense for Content 
(see Chapter 5).
Setting Up AdSense for Mobile
Okay, the technical mumbo-jumbo is out of the way. I don’t claim that what 
you’ve read so far in this chapter is everything there is to know about under-
standing mobile programming languages and protocols, and creating mobile 
Web sites. This is an AdSense book and it doesn’t cover everything mobile. 
If you want to know more about creating mobile Web sites, check out Mobile 
Internet For Dummies, by John R. Levine, Michael J. O’Farrell, and Jostein 
Algroy (Wiley Publishing). If you really want the whole nine yards, go for 
Nirav Mehta’s Mobile Web Development. It’s technically dense, but you’ll find 
everything you need to know in it.
Setting up AdSense for Mobile is a lot like setting up AdSense for Content. The 
differences are all related to the mobile platform and are easy enough to navi-
gate. You have to tell the AdSense folks which programming language — or a 
markup language (or just markup for short) — you used for your site. You also 
have to tell AdSense which character encoding you used for the site.
Character encoding happens when you combine one set of characters with 
some other indicator, such as numbers or integers. Morse code is probably 
one of the best known sets of character encoding because it combines letters 
of the Latin alphabet with dots and dashes that are used in telegraphy. The 
result is that a set of dots and dashes (or depressions) can be sent with a tele-
graph machine and then decoded to represent the characters they represent. 
In other words, with a telegraph, you could send messages from one place to 
another.
Character encoding for Web sites works basically the same way. Characters 
are encoded with some numerical system. Then, the Web browser can decode 
those characters to ensure that they’re displayed properly. In most cases, 
UTF-8 is the most commonly used character encoding for U.S. Web sites.
I’m jumping just a little ahead of the game here. To begin creating your 
mobile ads, first log in to your AdSense account. Then use these steps to 
create the ad:
 
1. Click the Get Ads link on the AdSense Setup tab.
 
 The Get Ads page appears.

193
 Chapter 10: AdSense for Mobile
 
2. On the Get Ads page, select the AdSense for Mobile Content link, as 
shown in Figure 10-2.
 
 The AdSense for Mobile Content Wizard appears, ready to walk you 
through the process of setting up mobile ads (see Figure 10-3).
 
3. In the Format section of the wizard, use the drop-down menu to select 
the type of ad you want to display on your Web site.
 
 You have two options: Single or Double. Single shows the link to one 
advertiser whereas Double shows the links to two, but the ads are 
stacked one on top of the other.
 
 Mobile text ads contain 24–36 characters of text depending on the lan-
guage in which the ad is written, followed by a destination URL if adver-
tisers choose to enter one. Advertisers also have the option to allow 
customers to directly connect to their business phones by placing a 
Call link next to the destination URL. If the Call link appears, visitors 
can click the link to initiate a call to the advertiser.

4. In the Markup section of the wizard, use the drop-down menu to select 
the markup language used to create your mobile Web site.
 
 Your choices are WML, XHTML, and CHTML. If you’re not sure what 
these are, flip to the discussion about them earlier in this chapter in the 
“Mobile requirements” section.
 
5. In the Character Encoding section of the wizard, use the drop-down 
menu to select the character encoding for your Web site.
 
 If you’re not sure what character encoding is used on your site, AdSense 
gives you the option to Auto-Detect encoding. Make sure that option is 
selected.
 
6. In the Colors section of the wizard, use the color palettes to choose 
colors for the various elements of your ads.

195
 Chapter 10: AdSense for Mobile
 
 As with AdSense for Content, you want your mobile ads to blend with 
the pages on which they appear. Use the Color Picker (that pretty col-
ored box) next to each element to choose the color you want to use for 
that element. Alternatively, you can also enter the six-digit hexadecimal 
number in the text box provided to further customize colors if the one 
you want to use isn’t available in the Color Picker. However, you should 
know there are some markup languages — like WML and CHTML — that 
don’t allow color customization, so your ads are displayed in the default 
Google palette if you’re using one of these languages.
 
7. Click Continue.
 
 You’re taken to the next page in the wizard, where you have the option 
of selecting or creating specific channels to track your mobile ads. 
Remember, channels are simply tracking tools that help you visualize 
how ads are performing. You can add a channel to your ad, and then 
when you look at your AdSense reports, you can immediately see how 
one channel of ads performs over another.
 
8. In the new wizard page, use the drop-down menu to select a channel — 
or click the Add New Channel link to add a new one — and then click 
Continue.
 
 You’re taken to the Get Code page of the wizard.
Placing mobile ads to increase earnings
Placement is one problem that you’ll likely 
encounter with mobile ads. The format of a 
mobile Web site is already so small, so how do 
you place ads that catch the attention of mobile 
surfers?
My suggestion is to place them near the top of 
the page. For example, if you’re setting up your 
mobile Web site so that a small logo appears 
and then content and links for your page imme-
diately display, ads appear between the logo 
and the content.
This gets the ads right in front of the mobile 
Web site users as quickly as possible to ensure 
they don’t navigate away from the page before 
your ads are seen.
Another alternative might be to put your ads 
at the top of a list of links that appear on your 
mobile Web page. This integrates the ads into 
the links, making them feel a little more natural 
on the site. But again, they’re still above the links 
so that users have the chance to actually see the 
ads before they navigate away from the page.
Ultimately, the perfect placement of your ads 
may take some trial-and-error. With any form 
of AdSense, don’t take my word — or anyone 
else’s for that matter — as gospel. Instead, 
begin with my suggestions and test your ads 
over a period of time to see where they earn 
the most click-throughs for your site. Only thor-
ough testing can you really determine what 
works and what doesn’t on your specific pages. 
Ultimately, what works for you is all that really 
matters, right?

196
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
 In this last page of the wizard, you see one major difference from the 
AdSense for Content routine. Check out Figure 10-4, where you can see 
a Server-Side Scripting Language drop-down menu right above the box 
that contains the code for your ad.
 
9. In the Server-Side Scripting Language drop-down menu, choose the 
language that was used during the creation of your Web site.
 
 The code changes to reflect the option that you select.
 
10. Copy and paste the code into your mobile Web site.
 
 Paste the ad code into your mobile site in the same way you paste the 
code into a regular Web site. Find the location on the site where you 
want the ad to appear and paste the code there. Remember, however, 
that it can take up to 48 hours for ads to start appearing on your pages.

197
 Chapter 10: AdSense for Mobile
 
Just as you can with content ads, you can filter your mobile ads to prevent 
your competitors from advertising on your mobile site. To filter a site, go 
to the AdSense Setup tab and select the Competitive Ad Filter link. After the 
Competitive Ad Filter page loads, select the AdSense for Mobile Content 
tab and enter the URLs that you want filtered. Enter one URL per line. When 
you’re finished, click the Save Changes button below the text box.
Earning with AdSense for Mobile
The AdSense way of doing things is pretty much the same across all ad 
formats — visitor clicks ad, you get money. Mobile ads do have one wrinkle 
that you haven’t seen in other types of ads, though, and that’s the Click 
to Call link. This link allows visitors to click the link and place a call to the 
advertiser. It’s a cool feature, but one that might leave you wondering how 
you’ll get paid for that.
Truth is that this link works just like any other link in an ad. You get paid for 
mobile ads whenever your site visitors click the ad links. That includes the 
Click to Call link. Like other types of AdSense ads, the amount of payment 
is determined by the payments that advertisers make when their ads are 
displayed. It’s a formula that Google keeps closely guarded, but it works the 
same as AdSense for Content and other types of AdSense. Advertisers bid for 
the right to have their ads shown. Then, each time the ad is shown, Google 
gets paid whatever that winning bid amount is. In turn, Google then gives 
a percentage of what it is paid to you, the Web site owner who publishes 
the ad. But how much is the exact percentage? Google is pretty tight-lipped 
about it.
You can track your AdSense for Mobile earnings on the Reports page, which 
is the first page you encounter when you sign in to your AdSense account. 
Included here is a category for AdSense for Mobile Content that shows page 
impressions, clicks, click-through-rates, effective cost-per-thousand impres-
sions, and earnings. Like other reports, you can show these numbers by day, 
week, month, or all the time. (For more on AdSense Reports, see Chapter 15.)
Mobile Web sites, and by extension mobile ads, aren’t for everyone. You may 
not have a Web site that’s appropriate for (or is even of interest to) mobile 
surfers. That’s a call you have to make.
If your site does lend itself to the mobile lifestyle, however, consider AdSense 
for Mobile. It’s one way to monetize your mobile efforts — and although the 
revenues that you generate for mobile ads might not be enough to pay the 
mortgage or the payment on that shiny new car you rushed out and bought 
when you were approved to display AdSense ads, it might add a little to the 
revenue streams that you’re building. In my book, every little bit helps.

AdSense for RSS
In This Chapter
 Familiarizing yourself with RSS and dynamic content feeds
 Doing the beta thing
 Signing up for AdSense for RSS updates
 Earning by feeding
E
very once in a while you stumble across a great idea that hasn’t quite 
made it to fruition yet. That’s what AdSense for Feeds is. It really is a 
great idea — who could hate the ability to place ads in dynamic content 
that’s pushed out to readers? — but it’s an idea that hasn’t quite made its 
way off the production line yet.
Another way of putting this is to say that AdSense for Feeds is still just a con-
cept. As I write this, it’s in closed beta testing and there is no word from the 
company about when the beta testing will end and general public release will 
begin. (I’ve heard rumors that it will be open to the general public soon, but I 
really can’t confirm any of those rumors.)
I still think covering the topic is a good idea. The program is sure to be avail-
able sooner, rather than later, and if you already know how to use it, you’ll 
be ahead of the learning curve. Because you can sign up to be notified when 
AdSense releases the program for general use, you won’t have to waste any 
time when it does become available.
Feed What? An RSS?
As the popularity of blogs grew, so did the popularity of another technology, 
called a feed or RSS feed. Both of these terms refer to the same thing. Feeds 
are content that is pushed out to registered users who have signed up to 
receive them. The content that’s pushed out can be short teasers about blog 
posts, news, or podcasts or it can be a complete blog post, news item, or 
article.

200
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
Podcasts can’t be pushed out through RSS, but you can send a teaser or blurb 
about the podcast. (And, if you think podcasts have something to do with the 
pod people from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, have I got news for you: A pod-
cast is actually an audio recording that’s available to listen to online. It’s 
an audio version of an article, news story, or blog post.)
Pushing content
Think of feeds like the ticker tapes that were used to transmit breaking news 
into newsrooms around the world back in the 1940s and ’50s. Only this ticker 
tape is faster, produces less waste, and is written in complete sentences.
The technology is different, but the result is the same — news is shared as 
soon as it’s created. Now, I can hear you grumbling that blogs aren’t news. 
Blog usually are news to someone. Does that mean that what you’ll find in a 
blog is going to appear on the 6:00 news or as headlines in tomorrow’s news-
paper? Not usually. But for every blog out there, there is a host of people who 
read the blog and want to know when a new post goes up. To those people, 
those posts are news, and they wouldn’t mind at all if news was updated in 
the timeliest fashion possible.
Because blogs have become so important in communicating in today’s 
Internet-centric world, people often read multiple blogs every day. I know 
people who subscribe to feeds for a dozen or more blogs every day. The 
blogs vary — some like news, some like blogs in a particular niche area, 
and some just like the stories about other people’s lives. Whatever draws a 
person, there is usually more than one blog for them to keep up with, and 
that’s where feeds come in.
 
Despite what you may have heard, RSS doesn’t stand for Really Simple Stupid. 
It actually stands for Really Simple Syndication, and it’s a protocol by which 
content is delivered to a user who can read the content using an RSS reader or 
feed reader — programs that display the content pushed out in RSS or feeds. 
This content may be a small snippet — up to about 250 words — or it may be 
the whole article. The person who sets up the feed determines how much text 
is delivered to the reader.
Reading content
I’ve tied RSS feeds into the bloggy part of the Internet, but I have to be a bit 
careful here. Accessing blogs is a no-brainer — you fire up your browser, 
point it to the correct URL, and start reading away. RSS feeds are a bit differ-
ent in that, as I mention earlier, you need a special software program — an 
RSS reader or feed reader — in order to access RSS feeds.

201
 Chapter 11: AdSense for RSS
Not that it’s at all hard to find a feed reader. Examples abound, including 
a Google variant (of course!) known as the Google Reader (www.google.
com/reader) as well as Feedreader, a neat little product available at www.
feedreader.com. I’m not talking rocket science here. All you need is a rela-
tively simple software program that’s been programmed to collect content 
from various feed-enabled sources.
Using programs like Google Reader or Feedreader is usually pretty simple. You 
begin with the application, which provides you with the “window” for reading 
the selected content. To add content to the program, you usually just have to 
enter a URL. The program then goes out and gets new content either on a sched-
ule that you set or in real-time. For example, if you’re using the feed reader that’s 
built in to Outlook 2007, when you check your e-mail — or whenever Outlook is 
scheduled to download your mail — your feeds are also automatically updated. 
New feeds are updated in the Feed Display folder, just like new e-mails.
If you’re using a program like Google Reader, the feeds are collected on a 
Web site. You log in to the site to see a listing of all the available posts — that 
listing is automatically updated each time someone posts a new item to the 
feed to which you’re subscribed.
The AdSense connection
You might be saying to yourself “Self, this is truly fascinating stuff, but where 
does AdSense fit in to all this?” Wonder no longer. AdSense, in its infinite 
wisdom, is working on software that would place AdSense ads directly into 
the RSS feeds that are pushed out to subscribers. The idea here is that even 
though you have content that’s pushed out to readers, you can still monetize 
that content with ads. This is an especially valuable concept for Web site 
owners out there who provide complete content in feeds.
Often, a Web site (or blog) owner will only syndicate a small portion of his con-
tent, specifically because doing so forces the readers to come to the Web site 
to finish reading the content, which increases the chances that those readers 
will click any ads that are shown on the site. Pushing your ads out with your 
content gives you one more opportunity to get ads in front of readers.
Beta Testing, Still
The idea behind AdSense for RSS is that you can
 
 Create dynamic content — content that changes frequently.
 
 Have that content pushed out to your readers.
 
 Place ads within the content that remain intact, even if the reader doesn’t 
visit your Web site.

202
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
It’s a grand idea, but the program is still in beta testing. And the beta testing 
is closed to new users — at least for a little while longer. So, even though the 
AdSense Web site advertises AdSense for RSS, you can’t access it.
You can, however, sign up to be notified if and when the program moves 
forward. It’s closed to beta testers as of the writing of this book, so signing 
up for updates is the only option available right now. If you’d like to receive 
notices about the general availability of AdSense for RSS, you can sign up 
at http://services.google.com/ads_inquiry/aff. Just enter the 
requested information. Then, as AdSense for RSS updates are released, you’ll 
be notified.
Getting Started with AdSense for Feeds
In discussions with AdSense team members, I get the impression that 
AdSense for Feeds won’t be in beta testing too much longer. If that’s the case, 
you’ll want to know how to use it once it becomes available to you. Not a 
problem. I have seen the future — beta tester that I am — and it is cool!
The first thing you need to know is that AdSense for Feeds needs two sub-
scriptions. One is to AdSense (of course), and the other is to another Google 
program — FeedBurner. At the time of this writing, those two accounts are 
not the same. And unlike other Google programs, you can’t sign in to your 
FeedBurner account using your Google Account information. You have to 
create a separate account. (Rumor has it that this will change in the near 
future, but no one can give me an exact date.)
FeedBurner is a program that lets you track how your feeds perform. With 
this program, you can analyze, optimize, monetize, and publicize your 
content feeds. FeedBurner also has an option for troubleshooting, called 
Troubleshootize — wouldn’t want to break with the -ize theme.
Creating an account in FeedBurner is easy enough. All you have to do is
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.feedburner.com.
 
 Feedburner’s home page loads on your computer screen.
 
2. Click the Register link in the upper-right corner of the page.
 
 The Create an Account page appears.
 
3. Enter the requested information in the Create an Account page and 
then click Sign In.
 
 You’re automatically signed in to your new account where you’ll see 
a bold, red message, like the one shown in Figure 11-1. This is your 
prompt to create — or burn — your first feed account.

203
 Chapter 11: AdSense for RSS
 
4. Enter the URL of your blog, podcast, or news feed into the text field 
and then click Next.
 
 A new page appears, giving you some information about your feed.
 
5. Read through the information, and then if you want, you can change 
the feed title or the feed address. When you’re ready, click Activate 
Feed.
 
 The information provided on the next page gives you details for the ser-
vices that have been enabled. You’ll see mention of BrowserFriendly, a 
service that approves the appearance of your feed in most browser win-
dows and makes it easier to subscribe to, and FeedBurner stats, a service 
that tracks basic traffic statistics — like number of subscribers — for 
your feed. You also get the option to add other traffic statistics services.
 
6. If you want to add other services, click the Next button. If not, click 
the Skip Directly to Feed Management link.
 
 Assuming you click the Next button, you’re taken to a page like the one 
shown in Figure 11-2.
 
7. Choose the additional tracking options that you want to include and 
then click Next.
 
 Click-throughs and Item Enclosure Downloads — that’s podcast down-
loads — are two of the tracking options included. You can also choose 
to use FeedBurner Stats Pro, which allows you to see the number of 
people who have viewed or clicked the content in your feed and shows 
the popularity of individual items.
 
 That’s it. You’re done. Now you can begin using FeedBurner to manage 
your content feeds. And you can use it to include AdSense ads in your 
feeds.

Enabling AdSense for Feeds
Just like AdSense ads that appear on other parts of your Web site, ads that 
appear in your feeds are unobtrusive. They usually appear at the bottom of 
the feed, as shown in Figure 11-3.

Enabling your ads is easy enough, just follow these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to www.feedburner.com and click the Sign 
In link.
 
2. In the new page that appears, enter your username and password and 
then click the Sign In link.
 
 Your feed dashboard appears.
 
3. Click the title of the feed you want to manage and then select the 
Monetize tab on the page that appears.
 
 The screen shown in Figure 11-4 appears.
 
4. In the In Your Feed section of the Monetize tab, use the drop-down 
menus to select how often you want ads to appear in feeds and what 
length of posts they should appear in.
 
 You can choose to have your ads appear after every post, or after every 
second, third, or fourth post. You can also limit the ads that are shown 
according to length. Your options are to show ads in posts of any length, 
or only in posts that are longer than 50, 100, or 150 words.
 
5. In the On Your Web Site section of the Monetize tab, select the 
Display Ads from AdSense Content check box.
 
6. Use the customization options of the Monetize tab to configure 
your ads.
 
 The configuration portion of the screen, as shown in Figure 11-5, looks 
much like other AdSense configuration screens you’ve seen before 
now. Select the desired options for the ads that will display in your 
content.
 
 Your available options include
 
 Color: Select colors for the border, title, background, text, and URL, 
or you can use a pre-designed color template from the available 
drop-down menu.
 
 Channel: Select the desired tracking channel for your ad.
 
 Ad size: You have two options for size: 300 x 250 or 468 x 60.
 
 Ad position: This option allows you to choose to place your ad on 
the left, in the center, or on the right. Keep in mind, though, that 
this is specific to the area of your feed where ads will appear — at 
the bottom.

 After loading for a few seconds, the configuration screen appears again, 
but you’ll notice there’s a confirmation message near the top of the 
page. You’ve created your first ad for feeds.
Of course, if you could just create the ad and be done with it, wouldn’t life 
be grand? I think it would, but you’re not that lucky. After you’ve created the 
ad, you still need to copy and paste the code for the ad into your Web site or 
blog account. (Remember, the code is still available in another window. You 
didn’t close that window, right?)
Different blogging programs do this differently. Here’s how you do it for 
Blogger. (You need to have both your Blogger account and your FeedBurner 
account open.)
 
FeedBurner actually provides specific directions for several different blogs, 
including Moveable Type, WordPress, and even a generic blog — one you 
might have created on your personal Web site or through your Web site host-
ing company. When you use the Get the HTML Code to Put Ads on Your Site 
drop-down menu to generate the HTML code for you, you get some handy 
instructions on how to deal with the code after getting it. 
 
1. Log in to your Blogger account and select the blog for which you want 
to include ads for feeds.
 
 If you’re not clear on the whole connection between AdSense and blogs, 
Chapter 13 should answer all your questions. Go ahead and flip over 
now. I’ll wait . . . good, you’re back.

2. Go to the Layout tab and select Edit HTML.
 
3. Remember that window from FeedBurner that you left open? The one 
with the code in it? Switch over to it now and copy the code provided 
by FeedBurner.
 
 This code is provided when you select the blog that you’re using from 
the bottom of the configuration page.
 
4. On the Edit HTML page of Blogger, place a check mark in the box next 
to Expand Widget Templates, see Figure 11-7.
 
5. Read through the HTML code displayed in the Edit Template box until 
you find the line that reads:
<div class=’post-footer’>
 
6. Paste your AdSense code generated from FeedBurner (see the previ-
ous set of steps) immediately below this line.
 
7. Click Save Template.
 
 Now you should have ads enabled in your feeds.
After you’ve created a feed, you can find it listed in the Review/Approve sec-
tion of your My Account page at FeedBurner. At this time, there’s no refer-
ence to it in AdSense, however. Even the ability to create ads for feeds is only 
available through the FeedBurner Web site.

Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
After the AdSense for Feeds program goes live, it’s likely the way ads are 
tracked will change. Even the way ads are set up and installed is likely to 
change some. So, before you begin creating your AdSense ad, you should 
check out the help topics in FeedBurner’s Help section to read about how 
the program is installed and how it works. FeedBurner’s help is much like 
Google’s, so you should be able to navigate it easily.
Style notes
One thing you’ll notice as you’re creating your feed ads is that the style options 
are very sparse. You’re really limited in both the size and the display that are 
available for feed ads because of the nature of feeds. Most feeds are mostly 
black text on a while background. That limits what you can do stylistically.
The important thing to remember as you’re creating your feed ads is that you 
want people to click through them. So, keep it simple. Black titles and text 
and blue links should do the job very well. Don’t try to use funky colors or 
to make every colorized element of a feed ad a different color. Basic is better 
when it comes to these ads because of their location.
Ads that are displayed in feeds will very obviously be ads. Remember to 
eliminate the border around the ad, and blend the text of the ad with the sur-
rounding text. It doesn’t matter if your Web site has a black background with 
lime green lettering. Feeds will appear to readers as black text on a white 
background. Make your ads match so they blend in as well as possible.
Earning with Feed Ads
AdSense for Feeds doesn’t currently have a designation on the AdSense Web 
site. In fact, if you’re not specifically searching for the topic, you won’t ever 
find it. And it’s not just the information that’s hard to locate. Anything related 
to your earnings or the performance of the ads is also non-existent.
At least for now, feed ads are tracked through AdSense for Content. I assume 
that will change when the program is finally released for general consump-
tion. At that time, it’s most likely that — like other AdSense programs — feed 
ads will have their own sections.
Until then, assigning a channel that’s specific to your feed ads is the best way 
to track them. Since the numbers for your ads will be lumped in with AdSense 
for Content data, without a designated channel you’ll never know what’s 
coming from your Web site or blog and what’s coming from your feed.

211
 Chapter 11: AdSense for RSS
When it comes to actually generating revenue from feed ads, the process 
works just the same as with other ads — users must click through an ad for 
you to be paid for it.
At this time, there’s no information available about whether feed ads will 
have the case-by-case instances of pay-per-thousand-impressions. That’s 
something that surely will be made public when the program goes live. 
There’s also no information about what the revenue share — how much you’ll 
make when a reader clicks through your ads — will look like with feed ads. 
It’s safe to assume, however, that it will take the same general (and vague) 
structure that content ads take.
AdSense for Feeds is such a great idea. There are so many instances of 
dynamic, feed-enabled content on the Web today that it only makes sense to 
monetize that content. How long it will take for the program to make the final 
cut and be released to the general public is anyone’s guess, though. In the 
meantime, keep working with your other AdSense ads — and be sure to sign 
up to receive updates on AdSense for Feeds from the team at AdSense.

The AdSense Referral Program
In This Chapter
 Differentiating among referrals and other types of AdSense ads
 Choosing between Google and non-Google referrals
 Creating referral ads that work with your Web site
 Understanding how you actually get referral earnings
G
oogle offers so many different ways for you to earn some money that 
it’s often hard to choose what’s best for your site. This chapter talks 
about yet another revenue method that you can add to your list of possibili-
ties: referrals.
Referrals differ from other ads in that they allow you to recommend specific 
products or services that you’ve used and liked to your Web site visitors. 
You can choose from hundreds of different products and services, so you’re 
not limited to just the obvious Google products (which tend to be the refer-
rals that you see most often).
Although similar in some ways to other AdSense products, the AdSense refer-
ral program is also a little different in the way that you set up and choose the 
products that you want to recommend. Earnings and earnings potentials are 
also different from what you see with AdSense for Content.
This chapter outlines those differences and helps you get started with 
AdSense referrals to earn more from your Web site offerings.
Understanding Referral Units
Recommending products and services to others on the Web has been a 
concept for as long as the Web’s been around. Probably one the best known 
referral programs (okay, referring to something in this context is the same as 
recommending it) is the one that Amazon.com offers for the books and other 
products that are available to buyers around the world. Everyone has seen 
the little Amazon boxes on Web sites that allow you to click through to buy 
the featured product.

214
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
Google AdSense offers the same type of service. The difference is that 
AdSense offers the ability to refer other programs or Web sites, rather than 
just offer the products that you like. For example, I use the Firefox Web 
browser, which is a personal preference, but I love it and think everyone who 
tries it will love it too. I include an AdSense referral button for Firefox where 
space allows on my Web sites. Then, each time a user clicks through that 
referral button and downloads Firefox, I get a small payment added to my 
AdSense revenues.
 
Referrals are a neat feature that can seriously help to bump your AdSense 
earnings if the referral ads are targeted well to your Web site audience. The 
key is in the targeting though, as you see when you get a little deeper into this 
chapter. There are two kinds of referral products — Google products and non-
Google products — so you’re not as limited in what you can refer your users 
to as you might be with other referral programs.
But why referrals? (Did you know I can hear you asking these questions? 
Well, okay, not really. But I do imagine you asking them.) The answer is 
simple really. Some of the best advertising that any company can ever get is 
based on word-of-mouth referrals.
No advertising in the world sells a product better or faster than when some-
one loves the product and shares that fact with others who then share it 
with others. If you’ve seen the commercials on TV with the domino effect cell 
phones, that’s a really good graphical representation of the concept of word-
of-mouth advertising, which is also dubbed buzz.
One person tells two who then tell four who then tell eight. This buzz grows 
exponentially until it seems like everyone is talking about the product and 
even rushing out to buy it.
That’s the same effect advertisers hope for when they place their products in 
the AdSense referral program. They hope to take advantage of the buzz that’s 
created when one person loves a product and recommends it to others who 
also love it and recommend it to others. As the ad-placement person, that’s 
good for you because advertisers are willing to pay to generate good buzz.
Google products
When you’re considering adding AdSense referrals to your Web pages, you 
have the option to refer Google products or non-Google products. Or, you 
can refer both if you like — up to three referrals per page.
 
One thing to remember is that you’re limited to three AdSense ads on your 
page. If you have three content units, a referral unit won’t appear on your 
page, even if you add the code. When you’re choosing your AdSense layout for 
your Web pages, be sure you carefully consider what types of ads work best 
for the visitors that will see them.

215
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
In Google referrals, you can choose from among the following six offerings:
 
 AdSense: You know what AdSense is. If you love it — and who doesn’t — 
you can add a referral button so visitors to your site can use it and grow 
to love it, too.
 
 Firefox plus Google Toolbar: Firefox is a Web browser from Mozilla that 
(in my opinion) beats Internet Explorer hands down for usability. When 
you add the Google Toolbar — a tool that lets you quickly access some 
of the most useful applications and features from Google — you have 
a winning combination, so why not recommend it to your users? It’s a 
pairing made for Internet power users.
 
 AdWords: If you’re advertising anything on the Web, you’re probably 
doing so with AdWords, Google’s pay-per-click keyword marketing pro-
gram. Recommending AdWords to others with something to advertise is 
a great way to boost your AdSense revenues.
 
 Google Pack: Google Pack is a collection of 13 useful Google products, 
all of which are free — not limited trials! Included in the Google Pack 
offerings are
 
• Google Earth: Offers maps and satellite images for most locations 
around the globe.
 
• Norton Security Scan: A program that scans your computer to deter-
mine if your computer is free of viruses, worms, and spyware.
 
• Google Desktop: A desktop search application that allows you to 
search the files on your hard drive just as you would search the 
Web. The program also includes program plugins, called widgets, 
that let you access other Google applications from your desktop.
 
• Firefox with Google Toolbar: Firefox is a great Web browser, but 
with the Google Toolbar added on you get Google search access 
built right into your toolbar, so you don’t have to go to the Google 
Web site to search.
 
• Adobe Reader: This program allows you to read Adobe PDF files.
 
• Skype: An Internet telephone service that allows you to speak to 
other Skype users using a microphone and speakers or a micro-
phone-enabled headset.
 
• Star Office (including Java): This is a complete office software suite — 
a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
 
• Google Toolbar for Internet Explorer: If you use the Internet Explorer 
browser, the Google Toolbar allows you to access Google Search 
from your toolbar without going to the Google Web site.
 
• Spyware Doctor: This program helps you find and remove spyware 
that may have been planted on your hard drive.

216
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
• Picasa: If you have a lot of digital pictures, Picasa is your organiza-
tional answer. This program helps you organize and catalog your 
digital pictures and also provides tools to help you edit pictures or 
create slide shows.
 
• Google Photos Screensaver: Use this program to create a screen 
saver for your computer using the photos stored on your hard 
drive.
 
• Google Talk: Google Talk is both an instant messaging program and 
an Internet telephone service.
 
• Real Player: A digital media player you can use to play MP3s and 
videos and to view photographs.
 
 Each of the programs offered in Google Pack are optional, so users can 
choose to download 1, 3, or all 13 software applications.
 
 Google Checkout: Google Checkout is an e-commerce application that 
has two facets. One facet is for buyers who are tired of entering their 
information time and again into online forms when they purchase prod-
ucts on the Internet. The other is for sellers who want to offer products 
or services from their Web site — Google Checkout acts as a site’s shop-
ping cart application.
 
 Google Apps: One of the newest offerings from Google, Google Apps is 
a collection of Web-based applications and services that businesses, 
schools, and organizations can use to improve productivity. Among the 
applications and services that are available through Google Apps are
 
• Gmail: Google’s Web-based e-mail application.
 
• Google Talk: An instant messaging and Internet telephone 
application.
 
• Google Calendar: Google’s Web-based calendaring application.
 
• Google Docs: Google’s answer to Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, 
and Microsoft PowerPoint. Google Docs acts as an all-in-one office 
suite for all your word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation 
needs.
 
• Google Apps Security and Compliance Services: Provides security 
and compliance for existing mail systems.
Did you even know that many Google products are available? Really, that’s 
just the tip of the iceberg, but those are some of the most used Google appli-
cations and services that are available. Why not recommend them to your 
site visitors if you use them and find them worth the time it takes to down-
load and configure them?

217
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
 
AdSense users can (potentially) see excellent earnings from some of the appli-
cations and services you can refer, something I detail in the “Earning with 
Referral Units” section a little later in this chapter. All I’ll say for now is that 
you’ll be pleasantly pleased with some of the referral fees that you can earn.
Non-Google products
On the flip side of the coin are the non-Google products that you can refer. 
Hundreds of them are spaced across 26 different categories. Browse through 
the Animals section or Travel section, but make sure you have a good chunk 
of free time available because some of those categories have more than 100 
products available for referral.
 
Of course, when you’re talking about referring a product, how do you know 
which one you should refer, especially when you can choose from hundreds? 
The easy answer is to stick with the products that you know. If you don’t know 
any of the products that are listed (which is highly unlikely because you’ll find 
referrals for all kinds of programs, such as SmugMug photo hosting and Boca 
Java Gourmet Coffee), you can always try them before you add a referral to 
your site.
The important thing to remember is that you’re not limited to Google prod-
ucts. You can refer any of hundreds of different products and services, and 
you can tailor your choices to what is most interesting to your site visitors. 
Also, understand that the referral fees paid for non-Google products vary 
by product. You can catch a glimpse of the expected earnings range when 
you’re selecting the products and services that you want to refer. For more 
on that actual selection, check out the following section.
Adding Referrals to Your Web Pages
If you’ve already tried a few of the other AdSense ad formats, you’ll soon 
discover that creating referral ads is a little bit different. Succinctly put, you 
have lots of choices, but your choices are restricted. I know, that doesn’t 
make much sense on the face of it, so let me put it another way: You can only 
do so much stylistic customization with any individual AdSense referral, but 
you have plenty of referrals to choose from, giving you the power to custom-
ize which products you refer to your visitors.
Even the process of creating referral ads is a little different. You don’t imme-
diately start with a stylistic choice for what kind of ad to create. Instead, you 
start with a location choice and then move into selecting what products you 

218
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
want to refer. Only after you do all that can you begin to worry about stylistic 
concerns. Differences in creation aside, though, setting up a referral ad is just 
as easy to get through as all the other AdSense types, and maybe even a little 
easier than some.
Referring from . . .
Remember how you created a content ad? If not, here’s a quick refresher:
  
1. Log in to your AdSense account by going to www.adsense.com.
 
2. Click the AdSense Setup tab to be taken to the AdSense Setup page.
 
3. On that page, click AdSense for Content, which takes you to the page 
where you begin to create your AdSense for Content ad.
 
4. Begin creating the ad by selecting whether to create an Ad Unit or a 
Link Unit.
 
 Remember, the ad unit is either text and links or graphics and links, and 
the link unit is links only.
 
5. After you make your selection, click the Continue button to move to 
the next page.
 
6. On the second page, choose the format for the ad that you’re creat-
ing, select the colors for the ad, and decide whether to allow public 
service ads or other placeholders. After you make your selection, click 
the Continue button.
 
7. In the next page of the wizard, select a tracking channel for your ad 
and then click the Continue button to be taken to the final page of the 
wizard.
 
 Tracking channels allow you to view how individual ads or groups of ads 
perform.
 
8. On the last page, enter a name for your ad that you’ll recognize if you 
need to come back and edit it, and then click Save and Get Code.
 
 Now all you have to do is copy and paste the code into your Web site 
(and if you don’t remember how to do that, flip to Chapter 5 for details).
The setup process for referrals is quite a bit different than the setup process 
for content ads, as the following steps make clear:
 
1. Log on to your AdSense account and click the AdSense Setup tab to go 
to the AdSense Setup page.
 
2. From the list of available ad formats to create, choose Referrals.
 
 You’ll be taken to the Referrals page, as shown in Figure 12-1.

219
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
 
Figure 12-1: 
Even the 
creation 
page for 
referral ads 
looks very 
different 
than the 
creation 
page for 
content ads.
 
 
3. Select the size of the ad you want from the Ad Format drop-down 
menu.
 
4. If this is the first time you’ve tried to create a Google referral ad, 
select your location (country) and language preferences.

220
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
 These preferences should be based on the preferred country and lan-
guage of your site visitors, not necessarily your own. (It’s perfectly pos-
sible to have a site in one country that serves visitors from another 
country.) Setting country and language preferences make it possible for 
you to refer the most relevant products to your users.
 
 There’s a little more to it than that though: Not all referrals are available 
in all countries or languages. If a referral on your site targets someone in 
an ineligible country, you might not get credit even if that person does 
what he’s supposed to do and takes advantage of the referral.
 
 You can scoot right through this section of the setup process. If you do, 
your referrals default to the language settings you have on your account, 
but you can go back and change them at any time from the Creation Wizard. 
The language settings are on the right side of the page, near the top.
 
 After you set the location and language for your referrals, you’re all set 
for the next step — choosing what products to refer to your visitors. 
The next section turns the spotlight on that chore.
You don’t HAVE to refer THAT
Write this down: You don’t have to refer any product you’re not comfortable 
with. Some people have the impression that if you set up AdSense referrals 
on your Web site, you’re stuck with whatever AdSense puts up there. That 
is not the case. You can pick and choose which products you want to refer. 
(The whole idea with referrals is that you’re supposed to be recommending 
something, and who recommends stuff they don’t like?)
When you begin setting up your referral ads, you have to go through setting 
up the location, as I show you in the previous steps. After that’s complete, 
you have two options for finding the products that you want to refer, as 
shown in Figure 12-2. You can either search for specific products to refer or 
you can browse all the available products.
Product search is available on a keyword basis. Enter the keyword that rep-
resents the products you think your visitors would be interested in and click 
the Search button. As shown in Figure 12-3, search results are shown in place 
of the categories that were listed on the page before the search.
If you don’t find what you’re looking for in the search results, click the Back 
to List of Categories link at the top-left corner of the page. This returns you to 
the category list so that you can search again or browse the categories.

221

Figure 12-2: 
To find 
products

Enter keywords to find products.
 
One way to narrow your search results is to use the provided drop-down menu 
to select whether you want to search for image referrals, text referrals, or both. 
Image referrals result in referral buttons, which look a lot like search buttons, 
but text referrals are great for including in the text of a blog entry or other con-
tent on your Web site. (You can read more about the stylistic uses of these two 
types of referrals in the “Customizing referral ads” section, later in this chapter.) 
The other way to find the products you want to recommend is by browsing the 
available categories of products. To browse a category, click the small plus (+) 
sign next to the title of the category (refer to Figure 12-2). The category expands 
to show the available subcategories, as shown in Figure 12-4. When you find a 
subcategory that you want to explore further, click the View Products link to the 
right of the subcategory.

about the product, as well as the available ad sizes and the monetary perfor-
mance of the ads, as shown in Figure 12-5. You can use this information to 
make informed decisions about the products that you want to refer.

224
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
Selecting the right referrals
Let me take a step back for just a minute and tell you a little more about what 
kind of decision-making information is accessible when you look more closely 
at the available ads. If you take another look at Figure 12-5, you see a View 
Available Ads link with another small plus (+) sign to the left — the universal 
symbol for click-me-and-I-expand. Figure 12-6 shows what happens when you 
take the plunge and click that little plus (+) sign. The list here fills you in on 
what you see:
 
 Top left: This info mirrors what you’d see in the unexpanded version, 
in Figure 12-5. You get a short description of the product, a link to the 
product Web site, and a View All from Advertiser link. If you click this 
link, only the available referral ads from that advertiser are shown.
 
 Top center: This is a list of the available ad formats. You’re not limited 
to a referral button with most of these products. (Again, you see this in 
Figure 12-5 as well.)
 
 Top right: This information indicates the average performance you can 
expect from this referral. The dollar amount shown is the maximum, 
meaning you can earn up to that amount, and there’s a Conversion 
Details link that leads to more info on the conversion requirements. 
(Conversion requirements spell out what has to take place for you to 
actually get paid. I explain all about conversion requirements in more 
detail a little later in the “Understanding conversions” section of this 
chapter.)
 
 Bottom left: Here’s where you see a graphical representation of the 
referral ad, as it will appear on your Web site. For some products, you 
get text links, text blocks, and graphical ads to choose from; for others, 
you may only have one choice. One thing you should know about what 
you see here is that, for the text links and graphical ads, this is exactly 
how your referral ads will look on your Web site — no ifs, ands, or 
buts. The text blocks are a bit more accommodating, in that you can 
customize the colors a tad. (I talk more about stylistic concerns in the 
“Choosing between button and text” sidebar and the “Customizing refer-
ral ads” section, later in this chapter.)
 
 Bottom middle: Here you find an explanation of the referral type: text 
links, text boxes, and graphical formats and sizes.
 
 Right side: The Choose Ad link appears in this section of the expanded 
block. This allows you to select single ads rather than selecting catego-
ries or even advertisers, both of which are possibilities.

When you’re selecting your ads, notice some of the restrictions on the 
number of ads that you can select. Here’s how the restrictions work: Referral 
ads can be static or dynamic on your site. Static referrals are those where — 
no matter whatever format you choose to display — you get a single referral 
ad and nothing more. You can accomplish static referrals in one of two ways: 
You can either select an ad that doesn’t rotate — like a Google Ad — or you 
can choose a single ad from the list of other products that are available.

226
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
You can, however, go the dynamic route by rotating the referrals that you’re 
offering, just to keep things from getting boring. If you decide that you want 
to jazz up your referrals, you can show up to 15 specific ads or you can select 
10 keywords and 10 categories from which your ads are selected. The advan-
tage of choosing the specific ads is that you have complete control over 
what’s shown. If you select the Keywords and Categories options, the refer-
rals that are shown rotate any of the ads that are available in those keywords 
and categories. Big difference.
After you decide on the ads and/or keywords and categories that you want 
for referral ads, you can move on to customizing your referral ads to work on 
your Web site. The following section shows you how.
Customizing referral ads
The odd thing about creating referral ads, to me at least, is that all the 
actions for creating the ads are on the same page. When you begin the cus-
tomization process for referral ads, you have the ads that you’re selecting 
from displayed on the left, but after you select an ad or category of ads, the 
customization abilities expand on the right.
When you first open the ad-creation pages, not much appears available for 
customization — you only see information boxes on the right side of the page 
for Referrals and Categories and Keywords. After you select the products, 
keywords, or categories that you want to refer, you begin to see customiza-
tion capabilities on the right side of the page — Referrals, Categories and 
Keywords, as well as Alternate Ads or Colors. Additionally, a new section 
appears under the Advanced Options heading — AdSense Unit Name.
To see how this works, go ahead and select an ad — one of those ads you 
tracked down with the techniques spelled out in the previous section. 
Selecting an ad brings up the customization section of the AdSense Unit 
Wizard, as shown in Figure 12-7.
First things first, choose an ad format. (Ad format selection is the top option 
on the customization section of the page.) To view your options, click the 
Ad Format drop-down menu — formats listed in black are available, whereas 
formats listed in red are unavailable. Feel free to choose any of the available 
options you feel suit the space you have available on your Web site.
After you get formatting out of the way, the menu on the right expands with 
additional customization options. You see these sections: Referrals (which 
list the referral ads you’ve selected), Categories and Keywords (which list the 
categories and keywords you’ve selected), and Alternate Ads or Colors.

The Alternate Ads part of the Alternate Ads or Colors option is where you 
choose what should show on your site instead of the referral ad in the event 
that a particular advertiser reaches its budget limit and its ad can no longer 
be shown. You have three options here to select from:
 
 Automatically Choose Fallback Referral Ads: This option leaves any 
fallback ads up to AdSense. If your chosen advertiser hits its budget 
limit, AdSense substitutes another ad.

228
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
 Show Non-Google Ads from Another URL: If you’re using more than 
one advertising program, you can have Google show ads from that other 
program if your chosen advertiser hits its budget limit. (How generous 
of Google!)
 
 Fill Space with a Solid Color: Rather than show any additional ads, 
AdSense blanks out the ad space you have set aside with a solid color. 
The only problem with this option is that as long as your ads are 
blocked (because advertisers’ budgets are limited), you have no poten-
tial to make money from this spot that you’ve set aside.
I select the first option for each of my ads. I have yet to see a time when alter-
nate ads needed to be shown, but I’m sure that it does happen. (I guess I’m 
just not picking the most popular ads in the referral program!) If you have 
another option or you don’t trust that AdSense will show ads of which you 
approve, the other options are just as viable.
Choosing between button and text
You have to decide whether you want to use 
a text ad or a button ad, or whatever other 
format is available from the Ad Format drop-
down menu. Typically, Google referral ads are 
available only as text and button ads, but other 
advertisers can offer their referrals in any ad 
format that’s available for content ads.
When you have to choose between the text 
ad and the button (or graphical) ad, which one 
works best? Good question. In my humble opin-
ion, text ads work best when they’re surrounded 
by text. For example, if the referral ad that you 
plan to place in your text is for Google AdSense, 
one of the text options available to you is Sign 
Up for Google AdSense. Work that line into an 
article and then use the referral ad as the link.
One catch here, though — you can’t change the 
text of the ad. No matter how you place that text 
within your text, the ad that’s displayed in the 
preview is exactly what will appear on your Web 
site. If you’re using the Google AdSense refer-
ral that reads This site monetized by 
Google AdSense, you can’t change that text. 
Working a sentence like that into an article is a 
little more difficult. In other words, if you choose 
to use text ads within text on your Web page, be 
sure to choose a text ad that blends well with the 
surrounding text.
Graphical ads, including button ads, are better 
suited for the outer edges of your pages, such 
as on the sides, top, or bottom of your site. 
Remember that ads on the top right, above the 
fold, tend to work best, but with referral ads, you 
can move them down the page and even to the 
bottom of the page. Referral ads appear more 
natural than other types of ads in those loca-
tions, so you don’t lose as much performance 
as you might with a different type of ad.
Your ads perform better if you place them cor-
rectly, so be sure to test different placements 
before deciding on a permanent home for 
your referral ads. (For my general thoughts on 
AdSense ad placement, check out Chapter 5.)

229
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
 
As for your colorizing options, remember that these are only available for 
text block ads, not text links or graphical ads. To see your options, click the 
Advanced Options to expand the Customization menu so it includes a Text 
Block Color section and a Custom Channel section. The Text Block Color 
option is the very first option that appears under this link.
The options in the Text Block Color section are limited to those included in 
the drop-down menu in this block, as shown in Figure 12-8. Choose an option 
from the drop-down menu, and a preview of that option appears immediately 
below it.
 
Figure 12-8: 
Select 
a color 
scheme 
for your ad 
alternative 
from the 
drop-down 
menu.
 
When choosing colors, try to get as close to the color scheme used on your 
Web site, but resign yourself to the fact that you just can’t match it perfectly. 
Because you can’t, stick with colors that are complementary to your site. 
Don’t do something dramatic just to draw attention to the box. If you do, 
you end up with a referral box that looks completely out of place and isn’t 
aesthetically pleasing, which (believe it or not) could cause your visitors to 
avoid clicking the box even if they’re interested in the referral.
 
Aesthetics, or the appealing look of an ad, are important. If visitors see a small 
portion of your site that looks out of place, they’re more likely to avoid it 
because humans, by their nature, need harmony. If your referral box is out of 
harmony with the rest of your site, it sends a subliminal message to visitors 
to avoid it. Don’t let a referral stand out like a sore thumb. Instead, keep the 
colors of your referrals similar or complementary to the rest of your site.
One of the last options that you have in the Advanced Options section — and 
this has nothing to do with the appearance of the referral ad on your site — 
is what channel you want the ad to be tracked with. I talk a lot about using 
channels in Chapter 14, but for now, you need to know that channels help 
you track ad performance on your pages or even on whole Web sites so that 
you can keep track of which ads are generating the most revenue.

230
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
If you don’t know how to create a channel yet, don’t worry. You can always 
create an ad without one and add the channel later — maybe after reading 
Chapter 14. Or, you can click the Add a New Channel button, enter a name 
for this channel in the text box that appears, and click OK. Then you have a 
channel that you can use to track the referral ad.
The last option in the Advanced Options section allows you to give your ad a 
specific name. By default, ads are named according to their size and the date 
created, but if you have a bunch of different ads and referrals on your Web 
site, keeping track of what’s what might be a little difficult if you leave the 
default name in place.
Consider creating a more descriptive name that helps you remember what 
the ad is and its purpose. When you see reports — once a week or once a 
month, depending on your preference — you can quickly decipher which of 
your ads is performing well and which should be removed or replaced. (Not 
sure what kind of reports I’m talking about? Check out Chapter 15. You’ll be 
glad you did.)
All you have to do is highlight the default text and type the name you want to 
use. When the code for the site is generated, the indicator that tags that ad 
with the name you’ve created is added automatically to the code.
Adding the code to your Web site
After you select your ads and customize them to your tastes, all that’s left 
is to generate the code and then paste that code onto your Web site. To 
do that, click the Submit and Get Code button at the bottom-right of the 
Referrals page.
The site processes for a few moments and then you’re taken to a page similar 
to the one shown in Figure 12-9.
Copy the code and paste it into the HTML of your Web site, making sure you 
place it between the <body> and </body> tags of the site. (Okay, I know 
there could be a lot of real estate between the <body> and </body> tags on 
a site. Exactly where between those tags you place your code is determined 
by your profound study of AdSense ad placement principles, as outlined by 
yours truly in Chapter 5.)
 
Every HTML editor is a little different, and the code for every Web site is dif-
ferent, so I can’t tell you exactly where in the text between the <body> and 
</body> tags to put the code, but you can play with the placement until you 
get it just right.

231

Figure 12-9: 
The code for 
referral ads

similar to 
the code for

ads.
 
When you’re done, upload your Web site and you should immediately begin 
to see your referral ad. Well, okay, you might temporarily get public ser-
vice announcements, but in most cases, the referral ad shows right away. 
However, if it doesn’t appear on your site within 48 hours, you may have 
done something wrong in the process and you’ll need to try again.
Promoting Referral Ads
Referral ads seem to be different than other AdSense ads in more ways than 
just how you create them. For example, it’s perfectly okay to promote your 
referral ads — to a point. Although AdSense definitely doesn’t want you to do 
anything to draw attention to your AdSense for Content ads, you have a bit 
more freedom when it comes to highlighting other AdSense products:
 
 AdSense for Search: Feel free to mention to your site visitors that you 
have a search box they can use to find whatever.
 
 Referrals: Refer away. It’s always best if you’ve actually used the prod-
ucts you’re referring so that what you tell your visitors is accurate. Tell 
them your thoughts about the products and share your stories of how 
the product has performed for you.

232
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
You’re absolutely not allowed under any circumstances to draw attention to 
the referral by telling readers to click it. Click Here graphics pointing to the 
referral box and anything resembling a directive to click the button are not 
allowed. Oh, you also can’t claim sponsorship — as in, This Web site spon-
sored by that product.
Go ahead and write an article about the product that you’re sponsoring and 
leave the referral text within the article as well as a referral graphic on the 
right side of the page. You can even tell your visitors that you recommend 
the product that you’re referring. Just don’t tell them to click the link or the 
graphic, and don’t try to force a visitor to pay attention to the referral ad. Let 
referrals naturally occur, based on your good experiences with the products 
that you’re referring.
Earning with Referral Units
If you think things have been a little different with AdSense referrals up to 
this point, you’ll really see the differences in the earnings department. Here’s 
where everything that you’ve read about AdSense so far changes a little bit.
Earning with AdSense referral ads requires some action on the part of your 
Web site visitors. Earning with referrals isn’t as simple as clicking through 
a link, or even searching and then clicking through search results. AdSense 
referrals have conversions — which are specific actions that must take place 
before you get paid for displaying the referral ad.
Even after a conversion takes place, the payments are a little different than 
what you see with other AdSense ads. All referral ads are paid on a flat fee. 
However, the fee that you’re paid can be influenced by your location. Each 
advertiser sets country-specific goals, so you’re paid up to the maximum 
amount shown for each of the referrals that you make from your AdSense 
referral ads.
To further complicate things, there’s a validation period when you first add 
a referral to your Web site. This validation period is put in place to help 
AdSense validate that conversions that take place through your referral ads 
are genuine. During this period, you earn the minimum payment for conver-
sions, with the amount increasing after the validation period is over.
Here’s the frustrating part — the validation period has no time limit on how 
long it lasts. On the AdSense Web site, Google states:
“For most publishers, the validation period should end quickly, but it 
will vary by publisher due to differences in the time it takes to collect the 
necessary account data.”

233
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
In other words, how long you’re paid the minimum instead of the maximum is 
determined by how much traffic your site generates and how often your site 
visitors take advantage of your referrals. That’s not exactly something that 
you can change or influence in much of a big way.
 
When you’re looking at the available referral ads, the amount shown in the 
upper-right corner of the referral information box may be a single dollar 
amount or a dollar range. When you see a dollar range, you notice this prin-
ciple of minimum versus maximum the most.
For example, I looked at an ad that had an earning range of $1.73–$15.38. The 
lower figure is the minimum, which is what you can expect to earn during 
the validation period after you place the referral ad on your site. The higher 
figure is the maximum, which you work up to earning as the validation period 
continues (until it ends) for any future referrals made from the ad.
I find the whole process a little frustrating, but I do understand why AdSense 
has the validation period in place. Without it, publishers could add referrals 
to their sites, ask all their friends to click through, do whatever is necessary 
for conversion, and rake in the dough. For a few days, the referral numbers 
would be really nice for the advertiser and the publisher, but then referrals 
would drop dramatically.
The validation period dampens this type of activity, making the actual number 
of referrals more realistic — which isn’t such a bad thing. With realistic num-
bers, you can know exactly what to expect from your referral earnings, and 
advertisers can know exactly what to expect from their referral spending.
Understanding conversions
Until now, I kept the whole concept of referral conversions a bit vague. Let 
me see if I can now give you a clearer picture. A conversion is an action or a 
set of actions that have to happen before you get paid for a referral ad. It’s 
not enough for you to place the ad on your Web page and have your visitors 
click the ad. Something else — a download, a registration, or something 
similar — has to happen before you get paid.
Here’s the part that might make you think twice before including referrals on 
your site — some of those conversions take time. A conversion requirement 
that visitors sign up for a membership on a Web site and remain a member 
for a certain amount of time — usually 30 to 60 days — isn’t unheard of.
Some conversions are simple — sign up for a newsletter, request information, 
and become a forum member. Others require a monetary investment from 
the visitor who followed the referral link — buy a product, purchase a mem-
bership, and donate a sum of money. The conversion details vary by product.

234
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
For example, the conversion details for a referral ad to Google AdSense are 
these:
“When a publisher that signed up for Google AdSense through your referral 
earns their initial $100.00 within 180 days of sign-up and is eligible for 
payout, we’ll credit your account with $100.00.
A Google AdSense referral is counted only for publishers never previously 
enrolled in Google AdSense. Google AdSense referral payouts do not count 
towards $100.00 threshold.”
Pretty complicated, huh? They’re not all that complicated, though. For exam-
ple, here are the conversion requirements for the Ghirardelli referral ad:
Purchase/Sale — $3.00–$11.54
Purchase Online
Really. That’s all there is to it. A visitor clicks through your referral ad, makes 
a purchase from the Ghirardelli Web site (It’s chocolate, folks! Who doesn’t 
love chocolate?), and you’re paid the referral fees. Of course, exactly how 
much you’ll be paid is still a little murky because nothing explains exactly the 
percentage of sale that’s credited to the publisher, but it’s still simple enough 
to understand. Visitors buy chocolate, you get paid, everyone’s happy!
The only way to know for sure what the conversion requirements are for 
a referral ad you may have selected is to look. When you’re examining ads 
(remember, I talk about this earlier in the chapter), you see a blue Conversion 
Details link. Click this link, and a small box appears that details what the con-
version requirements for that specific ad are, as shown in Figure 12-10.

235
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
Invalid conversions
One more aspect of conversions that you should pay attention to is the pos-
sibility of conversions being considered invalid. An invalid conversion is any 
conversion that AdSense deems isn’t the result of genuine interest on the 
part of the Web site visitor who clicked the referral ad. Most usually, invalid 
conversions are caused by Web site owners clicking their own ads, but they 
can also be the result of automated clickbots, clicking contests — where you 
offer a prize to the person who clicks an ad the most often or who clicks the 
most ads — or other forms of click fraud.
Because I already know that you’re not using those methods to generate 
AdSense revenues, consider this a refresher. Don’t participate in any such 
fraudulent activities. They’re not good for the ad programs and can have 
nasty results for you. Place your ads on your pages and allow visitors to 
naturally click through them. Don’t try to inflate your numbers by requesting 
clicks or convincing your friends to click through your ads.
Just let click-throughs happen. If you follow the principles I lay out in this 
book and work diligently to create a Web site that has true visitor value, 
earnings will happen. Then you can truly enjoy the revenue stream that 
you’ve generated without worrying about when AdSense will catch on to your 
less-than-honest methods.
Tracking conversions
If you place referral ads on your page, you’ll want to also track how they’re 
performing. AdSense gives you some tools to do that. After you set up your 
AdSense referrals, a new report becomes available in the Reports section 
of your AdSense account. Right there on the front page is the new Referrals 
report. If you click this report, you’re shown some stats based on the perfor-
mance of your referral ads.
For each referral ad you display, you see the following stats:
 
 Clicks: This number indicates every time that a site visitor has clicked 
your referral ad even when a conversion doesn’t follow.
 
 Sign-ups: When a referral product — like AdSense — requires a sign-up, 
and your site visitors actually do sign up, that number is displayed in 
this column.
 
 Conversions: When your visitors click through your referral ads and 
complete the required conversion, this is where that fact gets recorded. 
Conversions are listed by product.
 
 Earnings: Here’s the line that interests you the most, I’m sure. This line tells 
you exactly how much you’ve earned from your referral ads, by product.

236
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
Outside the reports offered by AdSense, you can’t track the actual conver-
sion of your AdSense referrals in any other way. This report is enough to 
help you see quickly which of your referral ads are working and which are 
not. The report also helps you understand what you’re actually earning from 
those referrals that are performing.
The earnings breakdown
The earnings you can expect to make for referrals will vary depending on the 
product you’re referring. They may also depend on the location of the user 
you’ve referred the product to. Some referrals pay more when users are U.S. 
residents, whereas others pay more when users are located in other coun-
tries. The difference is determined by where the company you’re referring is 
located and the target market the company is trying to reach.
Earnings are determined by the product owner or company that offers its 
products for referral. For non-Google products, individual advertisers decide 
the actions they want visitors to complete and how much they’re willing to 
pay for those actions as a result of clicking through the referral ad. You’re 
credited for non-Google referrals if a user clicks through your referral ad and 
completes the advertiser’s conversion criteria within 30 days of clicking.
For Google products, the earnings schedule is a little different. Well, okay, 
it’s not really different, it’s just lain right out there so you can see it without 
having to wonder or search for what earnings you can expect to make. Your 
earnings for Google referral products are defined as follows:
 
 AdSense: When a user who signed up for Google AdSense through your 
referral first earns $100 within 180 days of sign-up and is eligible for 
payout, you’re credited with $100. Note that it’s only when the user 
first signs up and earns $100. If a visitor has been a member of AdSense 
in the past, you don’t receive this payment. Also, this applies only to 
referrals located in North America, Latin America, or Japan. All others 
are counted as invalid referrals because AdSense doesn’t support other 
countries at this time.
 
 Firefox plus Google Toolbar: When a visitor you’ve referred to Firefox 
with Google Toolbar runs Firefox for the first time, you’ll receive up to 
$1 in your account, depending on the visitor’s location. Your referral 
must be a Windows user who hasn’t previously installed Firefox in order 
for you to receive credit.
 
 AdWords: When an advertiser you refer first spends $5 on AdWords 
ads within 90 days of sign-up, you earn $5. This is in addition to the first 
$5 that AdWords gives new users. So, technically speaking, users have 
to spend the $5 that AdWords gives them and $5 of their own money 
before you’re paid. If that same advertiser spends $100 within 90 days of 
sign-up, you’re credited with an additional $40.

237
 Chapter 12: The AdSense Referral Program
 
 If in any 180-day period you refer 20 advertisers who each spend more 
than $100 within 90 days of their signing up, you’re awarded a $600 
bonus. Note that bonus payments are limited to one payout per year.
 
 Google Product Pack: When you refer a Windows user to the Google 
Pack product and he downloads and installs it, you receive up to $1 in 
referral fees.
 
 Google Checkout: When a user signs up as a buyer and completes a 
transaction through Google Checkout within 90 days of sign-up, you’re 
paid $1. Note, however, that the transaction must be at least $10 for you 
to receive payment.
 
 Google Apps: When a visitor signs up for a new Google Apps account 
through your referral, you earn $.05. However, if the visitor creates a 
Google Apps Standard account and opens one or more Google Apps 
e-mail accounts that remain in use for four consecutive weeks, you earn 
$5. If the visitor signs up for a Google Apps Premier account, you earn 
$10 for each user license purchased.
Your Payment History page is where you see the monthly totals for all the 
referral fees that you earn — from both Google and non-Google products. 
The payment schedule for referral fees is just as it is with other AdSense ads. 
You’re paid once per month after your account reaches a $100 balance. Note 
that the exception to this is the AdSense referral bonus. If you earn $100 in 
AdSense referral fees, those fees don’t count toward your account minimum 
for payment, so you have to earn an additional $100 in AdSense revenues to 
receive that payment.
Also, the $600 bonus that’s paid when you reach the outlined requirements 
for AdWords is a once a year bonus. You can only receive it one time per 
year, so if you earn it more than one time in a given year and you’ve already 
received the bonus, you won’t receive that payment.
In general, AdSense referral ads are a pretty smart addition to your Web site 
if you have room to add them. Referrals are a relatively easy way to boost 
your AdSense income, but keep in mind that you do have to meet the con-
version requirements for each ad that you show, so choose your ads wisely. 
Also keep in mind that the better targeted your ads are, the better they’ll 
perform.

nformation is the purpose of the Internet. People use the Internet to share 
the information that they have and to find the information that they need. 
It doesn’t matter whether you’re an individual or whether you’re part of a 
company with thousands of employees. If you or your company has a Web 
site, the sole purpose of that site should be to share information with site 
visitors.
Those site visitors might just be seeking information, or they might be seek-
ing products or services. The products and services, however, are secondary 
to the information because before someone purchases your products or con-
tracts your services, he wants to know that his money will be well-spent. He 
wants something and he wants to know he’s getting the best deal possible.
Constantly updated information comes in handy here. Content — information — 
on your Web site needs to be regularly updated to get people’s attention. Equally 
important for you as a site owner, regular updates are what it takes to keep a 
search engine interested — and rating your site highly.
The Blog Explosion
Even as little as five years ago, search engines were loaded with information 
that had been the same for years. Many people never bothered to update 
the material on their Web site because there was no penalty for not doing 
so. Today, however, search engines look at information freshness as part 
of the formula to determine where a Web site ranks in search results. Web 
sites with highly relevant and regularly updated information rank higher than 
those sites that have had the same content for 3 (or 2 or 15) years.

240
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
To increase their ratings, most companies as well as many individuals now 
employ blogs as a way to put the most current and most relevant informa-
tional tidbits in front of people as quickly as possible. Blogs, by their very 
nature, are publishing on demand. Writers no longer have to put together a 
piece just to wait three to six weeks, or even months, to have that informa-
tion in front of people. Blogs allow writers — whether personally or corpo-
rately driven — to put their thoughts and collected facts in front of a reader 
in an instant.
For example, consider the Web site and blog Woot.com. Woot’s concept is to 
provide potential customers with a single product of high value every day. 
The company doesn’t keep a huge back stock of products stored in a ware-
house somewhere. Woot gets a limited number of a single product every day. 
That product gets announced and placed on the Web site at a very special 
price, but when it’s gone, it’s gone. No more. You’re out of luck.
The concept only works, however, because the company’s established a 
system of constant contact with its customers by using blogs. Notice the plu-
rality there — blogs. More than one blog and multiple blog posts per day.
The value in having multiple blogs — and having multiple blog posts each 
day — is that there’s more information you can keep in front of your site visi-
tors. The assumption is that it’s relevant information. Now, add AdSense to 
that, and you can see that the potential for income is amazing. All you have 
to do is create a high-demand blog, populate it with relevant information, 
and add AdSense to the mix.
Creating Blog Buzz
Blogs are everywhere. I subscribe to more than 24 blogs and I skim the posts 
every single day. When I find useful information, I take the time to read the 
entire posts, to follow links in the posts, and in general to gather as much 
information as I can from the snippets of daily information I find in the blogo-
sphere. Those snippets are the very information that makes blogs of all kinds 
useful to me and to a large percentage of the world’s population.
Without useful information, blogs are worthless. Sure, you can blog about 
your daily antics with Aunt Betty and her hairless pugs, but what’s useful 
about that? Not a darn thing. That translates to three whole subscribers — 
your mom, your Aunt Betty, and maybe your best friend. The chances of gen-
erating any kind of cash from those endeavors are exactly zero.
But, say you blog about how to use technology to generate big bucks in busi-
ness. Now, that topic will garner you some traffic. If you don’t believe me, 
check out all the blogs that come up in the results when you search for some-
thing like making money in technology. Astounding what’s out there.

241
 Chapter 13: AdSense Your Blog
Hot topics work because they mean something to subscribers, they cover 
valuable information that people are looking for, and they create buzz. Think 
of buzz like the conversations that take place in a bee hive. One worker bee 
goes out to gather nectar. Along the way, he comes across a field of the 
most flavorful flowers of the season. Mr. Worker Bee gathers his share of the 
nectar and returns to the hive to share his good fortune.
Upon his return, Mr. Worker Bee tells everyone he comes in contact with 
what a great field he’s found and provides directions to the other bees in 
the community. Within seconds, there’s buzz of both sound and activity. 
Welcome to Internet buzz, which works exactly the same way.
You generate a post on the Web that contains secrets for how to make real, 
living, growing slugs in your bathtub, and then along comes a visitor who was 
searching for that very thing on the Internet. He reads your post, decides it’s 
worthy, and immediately shoots off an e-mail to everyone he knows who has 
the same interests. Those people then visit your site, and they share the news 
with all their friends. Before you know it, buzz about your post is everywhere.
Buzz only works though if the information that you’re sharing is valuable to 
more people than your immediate family. Your first step in creating blog buzz 
is to choose a topic that other people find useful — and there are thousands 
of such topics. You can write about nearly anything and find an audience for 
it, but the idea is to find a topic that interests a large number of people over a 
long period of time.
A good way to figure out a great topic is to pay attention to the media. Yes, 
you have to wade through all the blather about the latest hot celebrity, but 
the media doesn’t spend all it’s time on the newest starlet’s latest psycho-
drama. For example, you’ll probably find a lot of economic issues and trends. 
When you break down economic topics, you come up with everything from 
making money to saving money and investing money.
Now, take that topic and divide it a little further. What do you do that helps 
you make money, save money, or invest money? For me, I could write a blog 
about making a very good living writing about technology. And I have, in fact, 
written such a blog in the past, which was quite successful, thank you very 
much. I don’t write it anymore because of time constraints, but it was a topic 
that I know well and could help others with.
 
Choosing a topic that other people want to know about is relatively easy. 
(Hey, getting rich off the stock market sounds like it might be a popular topic!) 
The hard part comes when you have to figure out enough about that topic so 
that you’re in a position to give useful advice to other people. That doesn’t 
mean you have to be the best-known expert on the topic. You do have to know 
enough to share useful information and to figure out what you don’t know 
though.

Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
After you have a blog in mind, all you have to do is create it. Fortunately, 
creating a blog is easy. Dozens of services allow you to create a blog for free, 
and it takes just a few minutes to set up one. Look at several different ser-
vices to find the one that’s right for you. The top three are
 
 Blogger: Blogger is Google’s answer to blogging. It also happens to be 
the easiest way to add AdSense to your blog. If you’re going to start a 
blog, I suggest you start here.
 
 WordPress: WordPress is also a pretty powerful blogging tool with free 
accounts. Here’s the rub though — if you want to have AdSense on your 
account, you have to pay for the premium account and even then it can 
be a difficult chore to put the code in the right place.
 
 TypePad: TypePad is a hugely popular blogging application that allows 
you to use AdSense ads in the footer of blog posts. It’s also not difficult 
to use, which makes it another good option for a blog that includes 
AdSense ads.
As I mention earlier, dozens of other blogging services are out there that you 
can try. Some companies offer business-specific blogs, and others offer blogs 
as part of a larger community of users. But for your purpose, I look at blogs 
that you can use AdSense with, and the service that’s most AdSense-friendly 
(of course) is Blogger. So, the remainder of this chapter focuses on how to 
put AdSense on your Blogger blog.
Adding AdSense to Your Blogger Blog
Okay, so you signed on to Blogger, set up your blog, and got the word out. 
You’re getting some visitors, and the great response you’re getting makes 
you think it might be time to put AdSense on that blog. Let the fun begin.
 
The one drawback with adding AdSense to your Blogger account is that you 
can show only three AdSense units on your blog at any given time. So, when 
you’re placing ads on your blog, be very selective about where you place 
them. Now, if you paid attention in Chapter 3, you know that your most effec-
tive ad placement is above the fold, at the very top of the page, on the right-
hand side (preferably in a sidebar), or within the text on the page. With these 
guidelines, you can place your ads for the most attention and the best results.
AdSense as a page element
You can place AdSense in your blog in one of two ways. The first (and prob-
ably easiest) way to add it is as a page element. Page elements are like the 

243
 Chapter 13: AdSense Your Blog
building blocks of your Web site. You can choose which elements you want 
to appear in your blog template by pointing and clicking the desired element.
Here’s how to ad AdSense with this method:
 
1. Point your browser to www.blogger.com and log on to your Blogger 
account with your username and password.
 
 You’re automatically taken to the dashboard — essentially the Control 
Panel — for the blog.
 
2. From the Dashboard, select the Layout tab for the blog that you want 
to add AdSense to.
 
 You can have more than one blog with Blogger.
 
3. On the Page Elements page (see Figure 13-1), click the Add a Page 
Element link.
 
 The Choose a New Page Element dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.

4. Locate AdSense in the list of available elements — or widgets — and 
click the accompanying Add to Blog button.
 
 The Configure AdSense dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
5. Make your selections in the Configure AdSense dialog box and click 
Save Changes.
 
 Here’s where you can tweak things like ad size or colors. You can even 
change your publisher ID, the number that identifies your AdSense 
account so that you’re properly compensated when visitors click your 
ads.
 
 Clicking Save Changes closes the Configure AdSense dialog box and 
you’re returned to the Blogger layout page. You can see your new 
AdSense widget immediately below the Add a Page Element link.
After you create the widget, you can move it around by clicking and drag-
ging it anywhere — anywhere on the sidebar, above the footer, or below the 
header, that is. You can’t move the widget to the main post area of your blog.

245

ited options 
available.
 
If you want to place ads within the area that’s reserved for your blog posts, 
you have to do it through the settings for the post page. Here’s how:
 
1. Log in to your Blogger dashboard (see the previous steps) and select 
the Layout tab under the blog you want to change.
 
 You’re taken to the Page Elements page of your blog layout.
 
2. Locate the Blog Posts section of the layout page and select the blue 
Edit link, as shown in Figure 13-4.
 
 The Configure Blog Posts dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Show Ads between Posts check box, see Figure 13-5.
 
 Additional options for configuring inline ads become visible immediately 
below the check box, as shown in Figure 13-6.
 
4. Configure your ad preferences — size, color, and publisher ID — and 
then scroll to the bottom of the dialog box and click Save Changes.
 
 Ads now appear between your blog posts, according to the preferences 
that you selected.

You can’t use these gadgets to put ads directly in the text of your posts, but 
you can use them to put ads between your posts.
One other method for adding AdSense code using widgets that gives you a 
little more flexibility is to add the code using the HTML/JavaScript widget. 
The HTML/JavaScript widget works in much the same way as the AdSense-
specific widget.
 
1. On the Layout tab, make sure you’re in the Page Elements view and 
then select Add a Page Element.
 
2. Select HTML/JavaScript from the list of available widgets.
 
 The dialog box changes to a text editor, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
3. Open AdSense and generate the code for a new ad.
 
 If you need a reminder on how to create ads, I covered that in Chapters 6, 
7, and 8.
 
4. Copy the ad code.

248
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
 
5. Return to the Blogger HTML/JavaScript editor, enter a name for the 
ad — this can be whatever name makes sense to you — then paste 
the ad code from Step 4 into the Content text box.
 
6. Click the Save Changes button.
 
 The dialog box disappears and you’re returned to the Page Elements 
view of your blog, except now you should see an element labeled HTML/
JavaScript.
 
 You can move this element around the header, footer, or sidebar of your 
blog, just as you would any other element, by clicking and dragging it to 
the desired location.
That’s all there is to it. The big difference between using the HTML capabili-
ties and Blogger’s built-in AdSense capabilities is what you can do with the 
ads. Blogger’s AdSense customization elements are pretty slim. By using 
Blogger’s HTML capabilities, on the other hand, you can create more custom-
ized ads on the AdSense Web site and then paste them into your blog.
Monkeying with the code
Plopping down an AdSense ad right in the middle of a blog post — rather 
than between posts — is a little more involved than just adding it using the 
widget feature, but it can be done. The result is an ad that floats off the left 
side of the post, above the fold.
I may as well come right out and say it: Getting an ad to float off to the side 
of your blog post requires that you monkey-around with the HTML template 
of your blog. Sounds a bit dicey, I know, and if you’re not careful, you could 
really mess up your blog, but I’m here to show you the way.
 
Before you make any changes at all to your blog, save a copy of the template 
to your hard drive, in case you mess up royally. I messed up the first time I 
tried to put the code into my blog. Fortunately, I had saved the template, so all 
I had to do was upload it and nothing was lost.
To save your template to your hard drive, follow these instructions:
 
1. Log in to your Blogger account and go to the Layout tab.
 
2. Click the Edit HTML link below the tab, as shown in Figure 13-8.
 
 The Edit HTML screen appears.
 
3. In the Edit HTML screen, click the Download Full Template link.
 
 A Save As dialog box appears.
 
4. Using the Save As dialog box, save the template to a place on your 
hard drive where you can find it.

After you’ve saved the file to your hard drive, you can play around with the 
template without fear of irreparably damaging your hard drive. Time to get 
elbow deep in HTML!

250
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
The HTML page that’s displayed when you click the Edit HTML link is every-
thing that makes up your blog. It’s a monster document that could keep you 
busy for hours if you don’t know what you’re looking for. Don’t worry though; 
I know what’s what. Follow me and you won’t lose your way.
 
1. Go to AdSense and generate the code for the ad unit you want to place 
in your posts.
 
 For the purposes of this illustration, I use the 125x125 square format.
 
 By the way, Chapter 5 gives you all the gory details on generating code.
 
2. Open NotePad (or any other text editor) and paste this code into a 
new document:
<div style=’float:left;’>
AdSense Code
</div>
 
3. Copy the code generated by AdSense and paste it into the document 
in place of AdSense Code.
 
 Replace those two words completely. When you’re finished, the com-
plete piece of code looks something like this:
<div style=’float:left;’>
<script type=”text/javascript”><!--
google_ad_client = “pub-00000000000000”;
/* 125x125, created 2/25/08 */
google_ad_slot = “000095560”;
google_ad_width = 125;
google_ad_height = 125;
//-->
</script>
<script type=”text/javascript”
src=”http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_
ads.js”>
</script>
</div>
 
 Your code won’t look exactly like that, but it should be very similar. In 
particular, some of the numbers will be different, and the design of the 
ad may also be different.
 
4. Open a Web browser, surf over to your Blogger account, and log in.
 
 This should be second nature by now.
 
5. Go to the Layout tab and then click the Edit HTML link below the tab.
 
 The Edit HTML screen makes an appearance.

251
 Chapter 13: AdSense Your Blog
 
6. In the Edit HTML view of your blog, search for the following line of 
code with the search function on your browser:
<div class=’post-header-line-1’/>
 
 You could scroll through pages and pages of HTML code to find what 
you need, but here’s an easier way. In Firefox and Internet Explorer 
browsers, press Ctrl+F to open a search box on your browser. When it 
appears, search for the line of code above.
 
7. When you find your little snippet of code, go back to your text editor, 
copy the code that you put together, and then paste that code immedi-
ately below the line you located.
 
 When you’re finished, your code looks like this:
  <div class=’post-header-line-1’/>
<div style=’float:left;’>
<script type=”text/javascript”><!--
google_ad_client = “pub-6630304584312230”;
/* 125x125, created 2/25/08 */
google_ad_slot = “9092795560”;
google_ad_width = 125;
google_ad_height = 125;
//-->
</script>
<script type=”text/javascript”
src=”http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_
ads.js”>
</script>
</div>
  <div class=’post-body entry-content’>
 
 Notice in this code that the first and last lines are exactly what you 
see in your template. That’s because those two lines were pre-existing. 
Everything in between is what you’ve pasted from your text editor.
 
8. Before you save the template, click the blue Preview button.
 
 This opens a new window that displays the results of the changes you 
made to the template.
 
9. After you preview the results of your cut-and-paste job and you’re 
satisfied with the results, click the Save Template button to make the 
changes to your blog permanent.
With the code in the previous steps list, you’re adding AdSense to all the 
posts that are displayed on your main page. The only problems that you 
might encounter are if you have more than two or three posts displayed on 
the page, or if you have multiple ad units displayed in different places on 
your site. AdSense allows only three ad units to be displayed on any one 

252
Part III: Other Types of AdSense  
page, so if your configuration puts you over that golden number, some of the 
ads won’t display properly.
For example, if you have an AdSense widget in your sidebar and at the top 
of the page, when you use this method to add AdSense to your posts, some 
posts will have blank spaces where the ads should be. To combat this blank 
space, either remove AdSense widgets or reduce the number of posts that 
you show on the main page of your blog.

AdSense 
Administration

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book is dedicated to helping you under-
stand the administrative functions of AdSense. These 
functions are essential to helping you visualize and 
increase your AdSense income.
Here you’ll find out how to track AdSense responses with 
programs like AWStats or Google Analytics. I also cover 
setting up channels — a great way to figure out what’s 
working with your AdSense ads. I then walk you through 
the reports that AdSense provides and how to better man-
age your account. I wind things up by detailing everything 
you need to know in order to get paid — how to set up 
your payment account, make changes to it, or put your 
payments on hold.

Chapter 14
Tracking AdSense Responses
In This Chapter
 Dealing with server logs
 Analyzing site traffic with Google Analytics
 Using AdSense channels effectively
A
nytime you track how well your AdSense strategy is actually doing, 
you’re relying a little bit on science and a little bit on magic. True, the 
only surefire way to determine what your AdSense revenues will be is to wait 
until they’re processed and show up on the AdSense administration pages. 
But that doesn’t tell you what works (and what doesn’t work) with the way 
that you’ve set up your ads or the placement that you’re using for the ads. 
If you want to know what trends seem to be influencing your revenue, here’s 
another way to go about it. Tracking your Web site traffic — more specifi-
cally, tracking what brings people to your site, what takes them away, and 
what they do while they’re on your site — is the best way to get a feel for the 
trends that affect your AdSense revenues. To track all that, you have to put in 
some work or find a really good program.
Which of those options you decide to use is determined by you. What are 
you more comfortable with? You can track everything and extract all that 
information from the logs that are available on your server, or you can let 
someone else do all the hard work for you so that all you have to do is take 
a look at the data that’s been gathered.
 
Both ways have advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately what it comes 
down to is whether a service (like Google Analytics) can provide all the data 
that you need. Such a service might not, and if that’s the case, you have only 
one option: Roll up your sleeves and do it on your lonesome.
Understanding Server Logs
Let me put it to you straight: The most difficult way to track traffic on your 
Web site is through your server logs. Server logs are also the only way to get 

256
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
certain types of in-depth detail about your site. I guess you need to know what 
sever logs are though before I get too deep into what you can do with them.
A server log — more accurately a Web server log — is a group of files auto-
matically generated by a server that tracks statistics about the traffic on your 
Web site. This group of files might contain information on where a user came 
to your site from, what pages on your site she visited, how long she spent on 
each site, and even more detailed information like what country she lives in 
(or the country her Internet access account is registered in) and some of the 
specifications about the browser she’s using.
Server logs are a complicated mess of facts and information that most people 
just can’t read. Seriously. You have to be one step above a NASA geek to 
understand all the gibberish contained in a server log.
Because most people won’t ever reach that level of geekiness, some pro-
grams — log analyzers or log parsers — take all that data, analyze it, and then 
spit out more understandable statistics. Programs like AWStats (which is 
free, available at www.awstats.sourceforge.net) and Summary (which is 
free to try but can be costly to own, available at www.summary.net) can give 
you the information you seek from the raw data that the server collects.
Even though these programs are easier to use than trying to figure out server 
logs on your own, they’re still not the easiest programs available. With 
AWStats, for example, you get to track your Web site statistics, but you have 
to have access to your Web server to use it. It’s also requires a little more 
technical knowledge than some of the other Web site statistics programs 
that are available — like Google Analytics. Still, if you’re ready to take on this 
program, it can potentially provide very in-depth analyses of the data that is 
collected in your server logs. I’m not ready to jump too deep into this pool 
right now, though. You’ll find more information on AWStats in the “Installing 
AWStats” section, later in this chapter.
I’ll be honest with you. Working with log analyzers can sometimes seem 
nearly as complicated as just trying to use the raw data coming from the 
server. Most log analyzers require that code be added to your Web site or 
Web server and then the reports have to be programmed before you can 
receive them.
On the flip side, server log analyzers can allow you to parse server data in 
ways that some other programs won’t let you. With this technology, you can 
design reports that meet very specific needs (if you know how). For example, 
if you need a report that not only tells you what page of your Web site that 
visitors entered on but also what time of day they came to your site most 
often, you can program a report to divulge that kind of information.

257
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
If you’re using a program like AWStats, the first thing to understand is that 
log analyzers count visitors differently than analytics programs do — one like 
Google Analytics, for example. AWStats looks at the IP address — the unique 
numerical address of a computer on the Internet, kind of like a street address 
for your house — of each site visitor. If one person visits your site a number 
of different times, AWStats counts that as only a single visitor. By compari-
son, a program like Google Analytics tracks computers by placing a cookie 
on the hard drive. That means that if a user clears out his browser cache — 
that’s a record of the sites the user visited using that computer — or if the 
user logs in from another computer, Google Analytics counts him as more 
than one visitor. Looking at IP addresses is a little more accurate because 
even if a user clears his cache, the IP address for his computer remains the 
same. (Logging in from a different computer is still a problem, but as far as I 
know, there’s no way around that kind of user being counted more than once 
with any stats program.)
Next, understand that programs like AWStats are more about the numbers 
than what can actually be extrapolated from those numbers. For example, 
with AWStats, Web crawlers are identified according to a list of crawlers 
defined by the log analyzer. Usually, a person creates the list, and the pro-
gram then compares data against that list to determine which visits are 
from Web crawlers and which are from real people. The problem with this 
approach is that if the list of Web crawlers is not all-inclusive, a crawler could 
be counted as a visitor. The result, then, is that the number of visitors can be 
skewed. Because AWStats doesn’t look at things like where a visitor comes 
from, it’s hard to tell what’s a crawler and what’s a visitor if the crawler 
doesn’t appear on the list of excluded IP addresses.
On the other hand, Google Analytics does look at where visitors come from. 
And Web crawlers have very specific origins, so it’s usually pretty easy to tell 
which of your visitors are people and which are programs that are designed 
to crawl a Web site.
Installing AWStats
AWStats is a free program that’s available from SourceForge. To download 
the program, go to http://awstats.sourceforge.net. After you down-
load it, install it.
 
If you’re planning to use AWStats to track your Web site traffic statistics, you 
must have access to your Web server. Unless you own that server (or your 
company owns the server), you probably don’t have that access. If you’re 
purchasing a hosting package from a Web site host, AWStats isn’t the right 
program for you to track your statistics. If that’s the case, you need to use a 
program, such as Google Analytics, that tracks your statistics without you 
having to get access to your Web server.

258
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
Assuming you do have access to your Web server, here’s what you’d do to 
install AWStats:
 
1. After you download AWStats (from http://awstats.sourceforge.
net), find the file and extract the AWStats package.
 
 Whatever extraction program (for example, WinZip — available at www.
winzip.com) you use will have different instructions for the extraction 
process, so refer to that program’s documentation if you’re not sure 
how to use it.
 
2. If the installation process doesn’t start automatically (it should with 
Windows Installer but it won’t with any other operating system), 
locate the AWStats Tools Directory and double-click the awstats_
configure.pl script to begin the installation process.
 
 Awstats_configure.pl tries to determine your current log format 
from your Apache Web server configuration file, httpd.conf. (The 
script asks for the path if it can’t find the file.)
 
3. If you use a common log, awstats_configure.pl suggests changing 
that log to the NCSA combined/XLF/ELF format.
 
 You can use your own custom log format, but this pre-defined log format 
is often the best choice and makes setup easier.
 
 If you answer yes, awstats_configure.pl modifies your httpd.
conf file, restarts Apache to apply the changes, and then creates a 
new file called awstats.mysite.conf by copying the template file 
awstats.model.conf.
 
 These actions should occur automatically (though they may require 
your confirmation in some areas).
 
4. To verify that the main parameters of your new configuration file 
match your needs, open awstats.mysite.conf in your favorite text 
editor — the file should be located on your hard drive and you can 
use the search function of your computer to locate it — and make the 
following changes, as required:
 
 Verify the LogFile value. It should be the full path of your server 
log file.
 
 Verify the LogType value. It should be W for analyzing Web log files.
 
 Check the LogFormat. It should be set to 1, although you can use a 
custom log format if you don’t use the combined log format.
 
 Set the SiteDomain parameter: It should be set to the main domain 
name or the intranet Web server name used to reach the Web site 
you want to analyze (for example: www.mysite.com). If you have 
several possible names for the same site, use the main domain 
name and add the others to the list in the HostAlias parameter.

259
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
 
5. When you’ve finished editing these elements, save the file to its origi-
nal location.
 
 Installation and configuration are now finished and the wizard should 
close automatically.
You may have to wait a couple days to see results from the log analyzer — 
and you still have to figure out how the program works if you want to get 
your results! After a couple days, however, you can begin creating stats 
reports by going to www.myserver.mydomain/awstats/awstats.pl — it’s 
a Web-based program. Just remember to replace myserver and mydomain 
with your own server and domain information. It’s a pretty complicated pro-
cess, though, so I suggest that you read more about using the program by 
going to http://awstats.sourceforge.net/docs/awstats_setup.
html.
 
Because Web crawlers change, a log analyzer can occasionally misinterpret a 
Web crawler as a real person. It’s not a major mistake, but one of which you 
should be aware.
Tracking Stats with Google Analytics
If you’re asking my opinion about the best programs to use for tracking Web 
site statistics — go ahead! Ask. — Google Analytics is definitely #1 on my list. 
It’s easy to use, it’s free, you don’t need access to your Web server, and you 
don’t have to be an ubergeek to use it. Google Analytics also provides all the 
statistics that I think you need. (I’ve been known to be wrong a time or two, 
but just keep that between you and me.)
Google Analytics started life as Urchin Analytics. Urchin was one of the 
premier Web site traffic statistics programs available on the Web — at an 
expensive price. Then Google bought Urchin and made the program available 
for free. The number of people who adopted it during the first few days of 
release was overwhelming. Google actually had to close the program to new 
users for a time to catch up with demand.
It’s no surprise that demand for such a powerful stats program was very 
high, especially at a cost of exactly nothing. The statistics that are available 
through Google Analytics will satisfy almost everyone looking for Web site 
stats and are certainly enough to help you understand how your AdSense ads 
are performing.

Part IV: AdSense Administration 
Understanding Google Analytics quirks
The thing about Google Analytics that’s different from a log analyzer like 
AWStats is the way that visitors on your site are tracked. Log analyzers tend 
to track visitors by IP address. Google Analytics actually tracks visitors by 
placing a cookie — a small snippet of code that acts as a kind of software ID 
collar — on the visitor’s hard drive. Then, each time the visitor comes to 
your site, that cookie is recognized by Google Analytics.
 
The more Web-savvy among readers will immediately see the problem with 
relying on cookies to get the job done. A cookie is only trackable as long as 
it’s on the visitor’s hard drive. So, if a visitor comes to your site, clears out 
his Internet history, and then returns to the site in the same day, that user is 
tracked as two different users. Numbers can get a little screwy.
Most people don’t clean out Internet histories on a daily basis — some never 
clean out them at all — but that’s one of the issues you should be aware of.
Google Analytics also can be fooled by people who set their browsers to 
not accept cookies at all. It’s a privacy issue. Some believe that when a com-
pany (any company) is tracking their movements on the Web, their privacy 
is invaded. On principle, they edit their browser preferences so that the 
browser won’t accept any cookies. (Editing your preferences is a snap to do, 
in case you’re wondering.) I don’t necessarily buy into that school of thought, 
but I can understand why some people would feel that way.
Regardless of whether you understand the anti-cookie stand of some folks, 
the fact still remains that a percentage of your site visitors may have set up 
their browsers to reject cookies. If that’s the case, Google Analytics can’t 
track those people. It’s a small percentage, but again, enough that you should 
be aware it’s a possibility.
Even with these issues, Google Analytics remains my favorite Web site traf-
fic statistics program. Because it’s free and easy to install, I recommend that 
everyone at least try it for a month or two. If you don’t like it, you can always 
move on to something else.
Intrinsically, the difference between log analyzers and programs like Google 
Analytics mostly involves methodology. Which program you use is deter-
mined by what you’re looking for. I much prefer programs like Google 
Analytics over log analyzers because, as far as I’m concerned, the informa-
tion that I need is covered by Google Analytics. You may not feel that way, 
and that’s okay. Just choose the program that works best to meet your spe-
cific tracking needs.

261
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
Installing Google Analytics
Google Analytics, like all Google programs, is easy to install. It requires that 
you register for the program and then install the tracking code. Easy-peasy. 
Here are the basics for getting started with the program:
 
1. Point your browser to www.google.com/analytics.
 
 The Google Analytics home page appears.
 
2. Click the Sign Up Now link.
 
 A sign-up page appears.
 
3. If you already have a Google account, sign into Google Analytics with 
that account. If you don’t have an account, register a new account 
with Google.
 
4. After you sign in, click the Sign Up button (as shown in Figure 14-1).
 
 You’re taken to the New Account Signup page.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Even after 
you sign 
in with a 
Google 
account, 
you need 
to set up an 
analytics 
account.
 
Click here to sign up.
 
5. In the New Account Signup page, enter your Web site’s URL, an 
account name (this can be any name you choose), your time zone loca-
tion, and your actual time zone into the appropriate text fields and 
then click Continue.
 
6. In the new page that appears, enter your contact information (includ-
ing name, telephone number, and country) and then click Continue.
 
 The User Agreement page appears.

262
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
7. Read through the user agreement, and if you agree with the terms of 
service, select the Yes, I Agree to the Above Terms and Conditions 
check box and then click Create New Account.
 
 You now have an Analytics account, but you’re still not quite done. A new 
page appears, displaying your tracking code, as shown in Figure 14-2. This 
snippet of code is how Google Analytics tracks the visitors to your Web 
pages.
 
8. Copy the code provided and paste it into the HTML of your Web site 
immediately before the </body> tag of the site.
 
 Now, you’re really finished.
After you place the tracking code on your Web site, it could take a couple days 
before you begin to see any statistics about the site on Google Analytics — 
stuff like number of visitors, where they came from, and how long they stayed 
on your site. Even then, the statistics aren’t really valuable beyond telling you 
who’s been to your site. There’s nothing historical to compare the statistics 
against.
Getting the real value of Google Analytics takes at least 30 days — long 
enough to have enough information to compare timeframes and see what a 
normal baseline for your site is.
After you allow enough time to establish a baseline, you can really tell what 
tweaks are valuable in terms of bringing in more site traffic — and seeing 
what may be pushing traffic off your site. For example, if you have a high per-
centage of your visitors leaving your site on a specific page, you know that 
there’s something about that page that could be turning your visitors off, so 
you can tweak the page to try to hold them on the site longer.

Analyzing Analytics
After you set up your Google Analytics account and have a few days to col-
lect numbers, the true value of the program starts to shine through. This sec-
tion shows you how to put that value to use.
When you log on to your account from the www.google.com/analytics/ 
page, the first screen that you see is a Dashboard overview of your available 
stats, as shown in Figure 14-3.

Google Analytics with Google AdWords
One very cool feature of Google Analytics is that 
it has reports that are specifically created for 
people who use AdWords to advertise. If you 
use AdWords (and many people who publish 
AdSense ads do), you can take advantage of 
reports, such as AdWords Campaigns, Keyword 
Positions, and Audio Campaigns, which allow 
you to specifically track your AdWords results.
AdWords is all about drawing new traffic to 
your site, so there’s no better way to track your 
success with AdWords than to use a Web site 
traffic statistics program. Google Analytics, 
being a Google program, is a natural choice. 
(If AdWords sounds intriguing, check out 
AdWords For Dummies by Howie Jacobson 
[Wiley Publishing].)

264
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
These stats are, by default, the stats most folks consider important when it 
comes to Web site traffic numbers. You may not be like most folks though, 
which is why you’re free to add other snapshots to the Dashboard if you’d 
rather see something there. One thing you can’t do, however, is remove or 
replace the Site Usage stats that you see at the top of the page. These are 
fixed permanently in place.
 
You can change the dates shown in the Site Usage section — the default dates 
always show the previous month.
You’ll find a handy navigation menu on the left side of the page, right under 
the Dashboard heading. This menu collapses and expands, according to 
where you click it. As shown in Figure 14-4, clicking one of the headings in the 
menu expands the menu so you can see additional reports that are available 
under that heading.

Headings expand to 
show additonal reports.
Of all the reports that are available to you, the most useful ones in terms 
of tracking AdSense info are found under the Traffic Sources and Content 
headings. Under Traffic Sources, for example, you can access the following 
reports:

265
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
 
 Referring Sites: This report, as shown in Figure 14-5, shows which 
other Web sites referred visitors to your site. This is important to your 
AdSense earnings because in addition to placing the ads on your page, 
you should also be marketing your site. One way to market your site 
is through other Web sites. This report tells you how successful those 
marketing efforts have been.
 
 Search Engines: The Search Engines report shows you which search 
engines sent visitors to your site. Because you know that your site is 
search engine optimized by keyword, this gives you a glimpse into how 
well your keywords are helping search engines list your site in search 
results.
 
 Keywords: The Keywords report shows which are the most popular 
keywords that bring visitors to your site. No better tool is out there for 
finding out if you’ve chosen the right keywords for your site. You can 
then use this information to ensure that your site is targeted accurately 
to the keywords that bring people in. In turn, your AdSense ads will be 
further optimized to the correct keywords.
 
Figure 14-5: 
See where 
visitors 
to your 
site come 
from in this 
report.
 

266
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
In addition to the Traffic Sources reports, the Content reports also contain 
some useful insights. All these reports are related to the content on your site, 
so if you want to know what’s working and what’s not, this is where to find 
out. The most useful reports from this section include
 
 Top Content: This report lists the most viewed content on your site. Do 
you want to know what visitors to your site are looking at or how long 
they’re spending on specific pages? This report tells you. The report, as 
shown in Figure 14-6, lists the top URLs. You can then click each of the 
URLs to view more in-depth information, such as the time users spend 
on the page and the number of visitors that exit from that page.
 
 Top Landing Pages: Landing pages are where a visitor first “touches 
down” on your site. The Top Landing Pages report shows you exactly 
which of your pages those are. This is useful in a couple different ways. 
First, if you’re conducting marketing with a specific entry page, you can 
track how effective that marketing is. Second, this information is helpful 
when you want to know what pages users seem to be finding on their 
own, especially if you’re not conducting any marketing campaigns.
 
Figure 14-6: 
See the 
most viewed 
pages of 
your Web 
site in this 
report.
 

267
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
 
 Top Exit Pages: Similar to the Top Landing Pages, this report shows you 
information about how users move about your site. The Top Exit Pages 
report shows you where users jump away from your site. If you’re an 
AdSense user, this information can be invaluable. Most AdSense users 
don’t put ads on every page on their site. Instead, they place ads on 
certain, optimized pages. This report, as shown in Figure 14-7, lets you 
know if those pages are where visitors are leaving your site. It’s not a 
guarantee that your ads are working, but it’s definitely an indicator that 
your ads could be performing well. You can use this information along 
with the data provided in AdSense reports to see which pages seem to 
be working better for ads.
 
 Site Overlay: For AdSense information, the Site Overlay is my favorite 
of all Google Analytics reports. The Site Overlay report literally overlays 
your Web site with a graphic that shows you which links on the site are 
most clicked, as shown in Figure 14-8. Above all other reports, this one 
is the most telling of how well your AdSense ads actually work.
 
Figure 14-7:

pages visi-
tors leave

this report.

Site Overlay
Each of these reports is presented in graphical format. At a glance, you can 
see the most basic information for the report. You can also dig deeper into 
the report and further segment the data by using drop-down menus (when 
provided) and by clicking blue, linked text. Each report has a different set of 
capabilities, so take some time to get to know the finer side of each report.
Remember that Google Analytics alone won’t tell you everything you need to 
know about how your AdSense ads perform. Combine your AdSense stats — 
the ones found in your AdSense reports, which I cover in Chapter 15 — with 
your Google Analytics stats and then you can get a clear picture of what’s 
working and what’s not.
 
Keep in mind that it takes some time to establish a baseline from which you 
can determine which efforts seem to be working and which don’t.
Channeling with AdSense
When you’re tracking what works and what doesn’t in AdSense, you soon 
discover that no single tracking method works best. Instead, a combination 
of tracking technologies helps you gather all the data you need. In addition 
to a Web site traffic statistics program, such as those I discuss earlier in this 
chapter, AdSense offers another method of tracking that can help you deter-
mine which ads perform best — channels.

269
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
Google explains channels this way:
Channels enable you to view detailed reporting about the performance of 
specific pages and ad units. By assigning a channel to a combination of 
pages or ad units, you could track the performance of a leaderboard versus 
a banner, or compare your motorcycle pages to your automobile pages. You 
can even create a channel to track each of your separate domains, so you 
can see where your clicks are coming from. While channels can be used to 
track performance and revenue, they won’t have any effect on your earnings 
or ad targeting.
The way you use channels is determined by how you want to track your ads 
and by the revenues generated from those ads. You can track them by ad, 
page, and even Web site — whatever works best for you. When you have that 
information, you can cross-compare it to your Web site traffic statistics to 
figure out even more about what’s working and what’s not.
Understanding AdSense channels
AdSense offers two different types of channels: URL channels and custom 
channels. URL channels track your AdSense ads by URL. You can track either 
single pages or you can use the top URL (www.sitename.com) to track every 
page within a Web site.
Custom channels allow you to track specific ads, according to parameters that 
you define. You can use a single custom channel to track multiple ads on mul-
tiple Web sites, as well.
 
When using channels to track your AdSense ads, the code that’s generated 
for your ad differs slightly from what would be generated if you weren’t track-
ing the ads with a specific channel. However, the code should still be pasted 
into your Web site or blog in the same manner that you added code that isn’t 
tracked by channels.
Creating effective channels
One very useful facet of using channels is that these differentiators allow you 
to track the effectiveness of changes that you might be testing in your ads. 
For example, if you’re running two sets of ads on your page, one with borders 
and one without, you can assign different channels to these ads to see which 
performs better.

270
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
Here’s a hint: Ads without borders nearly always perform better than ads with 
borders. Taking the border away seems to make some site visitors more will-
ing to give an AdSense ad a try — maybe because it doesn’t really look much 
like an ad.
The first thing you need to do when you decide to use channels is to figure 
out exactly what purpose the channels have. Why do you want to use chan-
nels? Do you want to see how well a specific ad design is performing? Or do 
you want to track how effective ads on a specific page of your site are?
After you determine what you want to track with channels, you can begin to 
create the channels that will serve your needs. You can create up to 200 dif-
ferent channels in your AdSense account, and after you create a channel, you 
can rename, deactivate, or delete it completely if you’re no longer using it. 
The next few sections give you all the details.
 
When you start to create a new channel, the process is set to create chan-
nels for AdSense for Content ads. You have the option to create channels for 
Referrals and Mobile Content, too. If you choose to create a channel for one of 
the other types of AdSense, click the blue linked tab for that option. AdSense 
for Search is the only type of ad that you can’t create a URL channel for.
Creating URL channels
Creating AdSense channels is an easy enough procedure. When you’re creat-
ing URL channels, have the specific URL that you want to track. If you want 
to track a whole site under a single URL, the top-level Web address is the one 
that you need to use. If you’re tracking a specific page on your Web site, be 
sure you have the exact URL for the page that you want to track. With that 
information in hand, here’s how you can create your first URL channel:
 
1. Log in to your AdSense account and go to the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. Click the Channels link on the AdSense Setup tab.
 
 You’re taken to the Channels overview page, as shown in Figure 14-9.
 
3. Click the URL Channels link.
 
 The page view refreshes to show URL channels that have been previ-
ously created (if there are any).
 
4. Click the + Add New URL Channels link.
 
 The page refreshes to show a form for entering URLs, as shown in 
Figure 14-10.

5. Enter the URLs that you want to track in the text box provided.
 
 Make sure you only enter one URL per line.
 
 To track a single page: Enter the full URL (example.com/sample.
html)
 
 To track a script that generates multiple pages: Enter the full 
path of the script, without the ? (example.com/sample.
asp?keyword=one)

272
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
 To track all pages below a specific directory: Enter a partial URL 
(example.com/sample)
 
 To track only pages across a specific subdomain: Enter the subdo-
main (sports.example.com)
 
 To track all pages on a domain: Enter the domain name (www.
example.com)
 
 To track all impressions and clicks across the domain (including 
any existing subdomains): Enter the domain name without the www 
(example.com)
 
6. After you enter the desired URLs, click the Add Channels button.
 
 Now you have URL channels available to you if you want to use them to 
track your ads.
Adding older ads to a channel
After you create a channel to use for tracking, the ads that already exist on 
your Web site aren’t automatically tracked. Instead, you have to update those 
ads or create new ones. To edit ads:
 
1. Log in to your AdSense account and go to the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. Click the Manage Ads link.
 
3. On the Manage Ads page, select the ad that you would like to edit.
 
 You’re taken to a page that looks like the original setup wizard for the 
ad except that it’s all contained on a single page, rather than on several 
pages.
 
4. Make the changes that you want to make — in this case, you’re choos-
ing a channel from the drop-down menu.
 
5. When you’re finished, click the Save button at the bottom of the page.
That’s it. Editing your ads really is that easy. And if it’s new ads that you’re 
working with, you can find more information about creating a new ad in 
Chapter 2.
Creating custom channels
You create custom channels pretty much the same way you create URL chan-
nels. The difference is that with custom channels, you use a specific chan-
nel name rather than a URL. When you’re creating your custom channels, 
use descriptive names for the channel. For example, if you’re testing large 

273
 Chapter 14: Tracking AdSense Responses
rectangles against link units, you can create two channels, naming one Large 
Rectangles and one Link Units. When it’s time to see the reports broken down 
by channel, there’s no doubt what each channel refers to.
Here are the steps for creating custom channels:
 
1. Log in to your AdSense account and go to the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. Click the Channels link at the top of the tab.
 
 You should be taken automatically to the Custom Channels page, but if 
you’re not, click the Custom Channels link.
 
3. Click the + Add New Custom Channels link.
 
 You’re taken to a channel creation page, like the one shown in 
Figure 14-11.
 
4. Enter the desired name for the channel and then select whether to 
allow the channel to be shown to advertisers as an ad placement.
 
 If you choose to allow the ad placement option, the channel is shown as 
available for advertisers to place cost-per-impression ads — ads for which 
you’ll be paid based on the number of people who see the ads.
 
5. If you choose to show the channel to advertisers, the form you’re fill-
ing out expands, as shown in Figure 14-12. Enter the requested infor-
mation and then click the Add Channel button.
 
 If you don’t choose to show the channel to advertisers, you can move on 
to the next step.
 
 You’re returned to the front channel page where you began, but now 
you see the channel you created listed below the + Add New Custom 
Channels option.

After you create a custom channel, you can go through the same process you 
used for URL channels to add ads customized to the channel or to edit exist-
ing ads. (See the preceding section, “Creating URL channels,” for more info.)
Tracking your AdSense results should be a regular part of your AdSense 
activities. Through tracking these results, you discover your successes — 
and failures. As with any technology, throwing it on the Web without thought 
of what works and what doesn’t isn’t likely to get you anywhere. But with 
some consistent effort, and tracking, you’ll figure out what works and what 
doesn’t. Then you can make the most of your AdSense efforts.

 Managing your AdSense account
W
eb site owners who publish AdSense ads on their sites tend to be 
obsessive about checking their numbers to see what levels their rev-
enue is reaching. If you find yourself logging in to AdSense 15 times a day to 
see how many people have clicked your ads, there’s an easier way to keep 
track of things.
With Google’s set of AdSense reports, Google provides you with the tools you 
need to see exactly where you stand — all in just a few minutes. Some of the 
reports can even be automated, so you don’t even have to log on to the Web 
site. Setting up these automated reports can save you time; time that you can 
spend creating better content, adding pages to your site, or tweaking the key-
words that you use to help the AdSense crawler target ads to your site.
The Overview
Google makes it easy for you to automatically know how much you’re earning 
on any given day, just by signing in to your AdSense account — you know, 
that little gold mine you keep at www.adsense.com. When you log in to the 
account, the first page you see is the Overview report, which provides you 
with a quick look at your daily earnings. In fact, right there in bold print (and 
it’s probably the very first thing you see) is the Today’s Earnings heading. In 
green, next to the heading, you see the amount of money that you’ve earned 
that day.

276
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
A little farther down the page, you see a table with details about how you’ve 
earned that money. The table lists the different types of AdSense ads you’re 
showing as well as the following statistics, all designed to help you under-
stand quickly what’s working and what’s not:
 
 Page Impressions: This is the number of people who have viewed your 
ads on a given day. This number represents all the visitors to your site, 
whether they stayed on the site or bounced right back off.
 
 Clicks: This column adds the number of times folks have clicked one of 
your ads.
 
 Page CTR: Short for Page Click-Thru-Rate, Page CTR shows the percent-
age of people who came to your site and then clicked through your 
AdSense ads to the advertiser’s page. The higher your percentage, the 
better your ads are performing.
 
 Page eCPM: Don’t ask me how they get Effect Clicks Per Thousand out 
of eCPM. (The acronym has something to do with the metric version of 
measurement, which really doesn’t matter to you one bit.) What you do 
need to know is that this figure is arrived at by dividing your total earn-
ings by the number of impressions in thousands. For example, if your 
site earns $100 from 10,000 impressions, your eCPM is $100/10 or $10. 
This represents the amount that you’re making per thousand impres-
sions, however, and doesn’t represent exactly how much you’re making. 
Instead, it’s a measurement that you can use to compare results across 
channels or advertising programs.
 
 Earnings: The actual amount that you’ve earned over a given timeframe 
is shown in this column. Specify the timeframe you want to examine with 
the View drop-down menu, shown in Figure 15-1. You can view results 
by Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, This Month, Last Month, and All Time.

277
 Chapter 15: Using AdSense Reports
 
The Overview page shows more than just how much money you’re making. 
This page also contains notes from the AdSense team, messages that you 
can view — stuff like the monthly optimization report that’s sent to AdSense 
advertisers — as well as links to quick reports. “What are they?” you ask. Read 
on and become enlightened.
Understanding Quick Reports
AdSense calls reports that you’ve preset certain variables for — dates, for 
example — Quick Reports. These reports are easy to get to. When you log 
in to your AdSense account, the page that you land on is the Main Report 
page. You’ll find the Quick Reports section at the bottom of that page. 
These reports are already set up for you — basically —, so all you need to 
do is click the link for the report, and a new page loads with those variables 
already in place.
 
When a new report loads, notice the customization options shown at the top 
of the page. (They’re above the fold; you actually have to scroll down the page 
to see the report data.) These customization options allow you to change 
dates, products, and even ad unit information to further customize your 
report view. I give you more information on how to use custom and advanced 
reports a little later in this chapter.
Figure 15-2 shows your Quick Report options for AdSense for Content ads. 
Here’s what each report entails:
 
 This Month, By Day: If you select the This Month, By Day report, you 
get pretty much the same information as shown in the Overview report, 
such as page impressions, clicks, and earnings, but you get that info for 
each day of the current month.
 
 Last Month, By Day: Instead of displaying the current month’s data, 
this report lets you look a bit deeper into the historical data to see what 
trends might be emerging. (Okay, deep here is a relative term; I’m only 
talking last month.) For example, are certain days better for generating 
AdSense income? If you can see those patterns and use them to develop 
useful theories and scenarios, you can test those theories in an effort to 
further increase your AdSense earnings.
If you use AdSense for Search on your site, additional reports may provide fur-
ther statistics about your AdSense revenues. Even though AdSense for Search 
is a little different than AdSense for Content, the reports should have the same 
outward appearance. The functions of ads are different than the functions 

278
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
of searches, but you end up tracking the same information — clicks, impres-
sions, earnings, and so on. Like AdSense for Content, you have reports for 
This Month, By Day and Last Month, By Day, This Month, By Channel & Day, 
Last Month, By Channel & Day, but you also have an additional report — Top 
Queries.

Remember, channels are just tracking capabilities. In the reports listed 
above, By Channel just means that each different channel — or tracking 
group — you’ve created will have its own section on the reports.
All the remaining report options are pretty self-explanatory, except for the 
Top Queries report. That report actually shows the same information as the 
other reports, but the information is ranked from most popular to least popu-
lar, based on search queries that visitors conduct from your site with the 
search box that you placed on your site.
 
If you don’t use AdSense for Search on your Web site, these reports just return 
empty, without any data.
Keep in mind that all such reports, whether they’re for AdSense for Content 
ads or AdSense for Search ads, come to you already pre-defined. You still 
have the option to change any of the variables in the report so that you can 
further segment (or separate) data that concerns your AdSense activities. 
That’s where custom and advanced reports are useful — so useful, in fact, 
that they deserve their own section.

 Chapter 15: Using AdSense Reports
Using Custom and Advanced Reports
Custom and advanced reports start out just like any other report that you 
run from AdSense Quick Reports except no data is preset for display.
When you select the Advanced Reports link on the Reports tab — remember, 
that’s where you land when you log in to your AdSense account — a page 
loads displaying your options when it comes to creating reports, as shown 
in Figure 15-3. These options allow you to define custom reports that feature 
the information that you actually need at the moment, rather than informa-
tion that someone else decides you might need.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Create 
custom and 
advanced 
reports with 
the options 
provided.
 
By picking and choosing among the various options, you can tailor a report 
to your precise needs. Your options are as follows:
 
 Product: With the Choose Product drop-down menu, you can specify 
which AdSense product you want to use as the basis for your report. 
Products here include AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, Video 
Units, Referral Programs, and any other type of AdSense ads that you’ve 
allowed.
 
 Only those products you’ve enabled in your AdSense account show up 
as options in the drop-down menu. Your Choose Product drop-down 
menu, therefore, may be different from mine.
 
 Date range: If you use this section’s first radio button, you get to choose 
from preset date ranges that mirror those available in the quick reports 
(Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, This Month, Last Month, and All Time).
 
 But hey, why go with the standard date range? I don’t run my weeks 
according to Google’s schedule, so I take advantage of the customized 
date ranges associated with the second radio button. The drop-down 
menus there allow you to specify the exact date range you want to use. 
If you need a report for a three-day period or a three-week period, or if 
you just want a report from Monday through Sunday, you can create it.

280
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
 View options: Another feature of the advanced reporting capabilities that 
you might find useful is the ability to change the way your data is shown. 
By default, the Show Data By drop-down menu is set to Page, which means 
that your data is sorted according to page impressions — the number of 
times your page is viewed, whether users click links on the page or not. 
Only there’s a catch — isn’t there always? It doesn’t matter how many dif-
ferent ads or types of ads are shown on your page; each page counts as 
only one impression. If you’re thinking about your impression figures in 
terms of having multiple ads on your page, they may seem low.
 
 Another choice here is to show data by Ad Unit. This data display shows 
your page impressions according to the number of ads that are on your 
page. So, if one visitor comes to your site and clicks all the 15 ads that 
you have on your page, you’ll see 15 page views for that single visitor. 
Now you have the opposite problem from the Page option. Instead of 
having page impressions that appear low because each visit counts only 
for one impression — no matter how many ads you have — now only 
one visit can create multiple impressions.
 
 Using both of these Show Data By measurements can be useful in that 
you can see how many visitors have seen your ads as well as how many 
ads your visitors have seen. If, for some reason, AdSense is displaying 
a single ad in the place of a large rectangle, for example, you can see 
immediately what’s happening. And it does happen from time to time 
when AdSense doesn’t have enough matching ads to fill the rectangle, 
which can usually hold several ads.
 
 A final option in the Show Data By drop-down menu — the Individual 
Ad option — changes your view of the data even more. When you use 
this display, you see how many impressions your site gets according 
to the number of actual ads that are displayed. Some ad displays show 
only a single ad — banners are one; you get one ad in a banner, nothing 
else — but others, like rectangles or link units, show more than one ad. 
When you view your report data with the Individual Ad option, you see 
multiples of impressions, based on the number of actual ads that are on 
your site.
 
 At the Individual Ad level, you can see your ads by what type of ad tar-
geting is used: contextual or placement targeting. Contextual ad place-
ment is when ads are placed within your content because the ad jibes 
in some way with the subject of the content. Placement targeted ads are 
those ads that are placed on your site because the advertiser chooses to 
have its ads shown on your page. This is an additional detail you don’t 
see in any other view.
 
 You also have the option to show aggregate data or channel data. 
Aggregate data is just a collection of the tracking information for all 
your ads. Channel data is a collection of the tracking information for ads 
broken down into the channels that you have selected to use to track 
individual ads or groups of ads.

281
 Chapter 15: Using AdSense Reports
When you’ve finished selecting the options that you would like to display for 
your ads, then all you have to do to see the report is click the Display Report 
button. The page reloads, and your desired information is displayed.
Each different data display shows the impressions on your site slightly dif-
ferently. Because the data is considered differently in each view, you see 
changes in your eCPM measurements as well. The fewer impressions shown, 
the higher your eCPM is.
Page impressions, clicks, and other report data, along with these different 
data views, allow you to compare ads and see which ones perform better 
than others. It takes some time to gather enough stats to be able to make any 
real determinations — if you have plenty of people visiting your site, a week 
might be enough; low traffic requires a little longer. With this data readily 
available to you, you can test different ad placements and types to discover 
what works best on your Web site.
Using Report Templates
The basic reports AdSense provides are useful enough for most purposes, 
but at times — recurring times — you need a report with a specific set of 
information and you don’t want to have to re-create it every time you want 
to run that report. No sense in reinventing the wheel, right?
Report templates allow you to set up reports, based on your specific needs. 
Each time you want to run that specific report, all you have to do is select the 
template, rather than re-creating the report each time that you need it.
Here’s the rub: You can’t create reports that are any more sophisticated than 
what you can do with the advanced reporting capabilities I talk about in the 
previous section. What you can do, however, is create the report once, fash-
ion a template based on that report, save the template, and reuse it whenever 
you want. (The idea here is to keep the template on hand so you don’t have 
to go through setting up the report every time you need it.) Here’s how you 
save a report as a template:
 
1. Log on to your AdSense account.
 
 The Reports page appears, with your Today’s Earnings prominently dis-
played.
 
2. On the Reports tab, select the Advanced Reports link.
 
 Your report options appear. (Refer to Figure 15-3.)

282
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
3. Create the report that you want to use as a template.
 
 Set date ranges, choose the type of report — aggregate or channel data 
display — and choose the product (AdSense for Content, AdSense for 
Search, Referrals, and so on).
 
4. Click the Display Report button to run the report.
 
 When the report has processed, you see a Save as Report Template text 
box at the top of the report, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
5. Enter a name in the Save as Report Template text box and then click 
Save.
 
 You see an orange confirmation box displayed if the report was success-
fully saved. If the confirmation box doesn’t appear, go through the cre-
ation process again in case you’ve forgotten steps or there’s a problem 
with the service.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Enter a 
name in the 
provided 
text box to 
save the 
report as a 
template.
 
That’s really all there is to it. After you create an advanced report, it’s saved 
as a template in case you want to run it again in the future. When you’re 
ready to run the same report again, select it from the Advanced Reports sec-
tion on the Quick Reports screen. You still have to change the date range, but 
your other selections are automatic.
Working with the Report Manager
Each time you generate a report, it’s automatically saved to a little corner 
of the AdSense world — the Report Manager. To get your hands on reports 
saved to the Report Manager, click the Reports Manager link on the Reports 
tab. Reports are collected here so that you can view them online or download 
them in CSV (Comma Separated Value) format, the standard used by most 
spreadsheet programs. To download the report, just click the CSV link, and 

283
 Chapter 15: Using AdSense Reports
use the Save As dialog box that appears to choose the location you want the 
report saved to and to choose a name for the report. When you’ve entered 
this information, click Save.
After you download a report and save the file to your hard drive, you can 
open it in Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet program that opens CSV 
files — Google Docs & Spreadsheets, for example.
For example, here’s how to open the file in Microsoft Excel:
 
1. Launch Excel and then choose File➪Open.
 
 The Open dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Open dialog box, browse to the file you saved to your hard 
drive, select the file, and then click Open.
 
 Excel’s Text Import Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 15-5.
 
 The file that’s provided by AdSense is a delimited file — the columns of 
data are literally separated. On the first screen of the wizard, you don’t 
need to change anything.
 
Figure 15-5: 
The Text 
Import 
Wizard 
walks you 
through 
opening the 
file properly.
 
 
3. Click Next.
 
 The second page of the wizard appears.
 
4. In Step 2 of the wizard, select the delimiter — what separates each 
column of the spreadsheet you’re importing — and then click Next.
 
 In this case, the delimiter is a tab (because you usually tab from one 
column to the next). That’s probably already selected in the wizard.

284
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
5. (Optional) In the final page of the wizard, feel free to change the for-
matting of the columns that you’re importing by clicking anywhere in 
the column and then selecting the proper formatting from the options 
in the upper-left corner of the wizard.
 
 For this file, the formatting for all the columns should be General.
 
 You can see your formatting without clicking each column by looking at 
the very first cell at the top of each column. This cell doesn’t appear on 
the spreadsheet, but in this wizard view, it shows you what type of for-
matting is already in place.
 
6. After you check or adjust the formatting, click Finish to complete the 
importing process.
 
 The Excel spreadsheet opens. If you want to keep it in Excel format, you 
have to resave the file as an Excel workbook.
 
If you really don’t want an offline copy of the report, you don’t have to save 
the file to your hard drive. Truth is, you can access your reports from the 
AdSense Web site for quite a while — about a year, in fact. After that period of 
time, reports get deleted from the site.
Scheduling Automatic Reports
One real timesaving feature of AdSense reports is the ability to schedule 
said reports to run automatically, rather than having to manually set up the 
report and run it on the site each time you need it. To take advantage of 
automatic scheduling of reports, though, you have to create a report tem-
plate before you can schedule it to run automatically. (If the whole idea of 
templates sounds a bit fuzzy to you, check out the “Using Report Templates” 
section, earlier in the chapter.)
After you create a report template, you should see it as an option in your 
Report Manager. (If it’s not there, then the template wasn’t successfully cre-
ated and you need to go through the creation process outlined earlier again.) 
Follow these steps to schedule the report to run automatically:
 
1. Log on to your AdSense account.
 
 The Reports page appears.
 
2. On the Reports tab, click the Report Manager link.
 
3. On the Reports Manager page, scroll down until you see the Saved 
Report Templates section.
 
 The Saved Report Templates section shows you all the reports that 
you’ve saved as templates. Next to each report is a Frequency column, 
a Send To column, and a Format column, as shown in Figure 15-6. (More 
about these columns in a bit.)

4. Using the Frequency drop-down menu, select how often you want the 
report to run.
 
 Your choices are Never, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.
 
 After you select a frequency, the default e-mail address is displayed for 
your account in the Send To column. That’s where the report will be 
sent unless you change it.
 
5. To change the default e-mail address, select an address from the Send 
To drop-down menu.
 
 If the address you want to send the report to isn’t listed in the drop-
down menu, do the following:
 
a. Click Edit Addresses.
 
 You’re prompted to save your changes before you continue.
 
b. Save the changes or click OK.
 
 A form opens into which you can type new addresses.
 
c. Add the new e-mail address.
 
 You can add multiple addresses, too. Enter the addresses one per 
line.
 
d. Click Save Addresses.
 
 The new e-mail address(es) appear in the Send To drop-down 
menu.
 
6. From the Format drop-down menu, select the format for the report 
that you want to send.
 
 Your choices here are CSV or CSV-Excel. (CSV Excel is just a report 
format that’s specifically set for Microsoft Excel.)
 
7. Click Save Changes.
 
 You’re done!

286
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
Your report is set to run automatically, but here’s a disappointing fact: You 
can’t automatically send the report to more than one person. You could 
set up multiple reports that are the same and send each one to a different 
person, but it’s much easier just to forward the report after you get it to 
those who need to see it. Maybe Google will add a Multiple Addresses feature 
in the future, but for now, you’re stuck with one address per report.
Using Site Diagnostics
In order to track down all the data needed for ad placement — as well as track-
ing down all the data that goes into the reports I talk about in this chapter — 
AdSense needs to be able to crawl your Web site. The crawler — not the same 
crawler that Google uses to include your site in search results, by the way — 
visits your site once each week to check for content, design, and usage informa-
tion. I cover how this works in a lot of detail in Chapters 2–4, so if you need a 
refresher, you can flip there. I’ll wait.
Done? Good. The AdSense crawler visits your site once each week. During 
that visit, the crawler looks at all the pages on your Web site to ensure that 
your ads are properly targeted. If the crawler encounters a problem, such as 
a page that’s redirecting unexpectedly (and without the proper redirect infor-
mation in place), or if the crawler is denied access to the site, it flags that 
issue in the Site Diagnostic area of your AdSense account.
To get to the Site Diagnostic area, do the following:
 
1. Sign in to your AdSense account.
 
2. From the Reports tab, choose the Site Diagnostics link.
 
 When that page opens, a list of problems that were encountered with 
your site is displayed.
 
 If the crawler didn’t encounter any problems, the list is mostly blank, 
displaying only the You Currently Have No Blocked URLs message in 
light gray.
 
 If you do have issues — if the crawler can’t get to your site for some 
reason — the reason is displayed in the table provided along with the 
date of the last crawl attempt on your Web site.
 
It’s possible (though highly unlikely) that when you updated your site, Google 
was trying to crawl your site at the exact same time. Sometimes, if you’re 
uploading files, the crawler can’t access the site at the same time. If that’s the 
case, the date of the last crawl reflects that.

287
 Chapter 15: Using AdSense Reports
Far more likely, however, is that a flaw in the site design or some other prob-
lem is keeping the crawler off your site. If that’s the case, the error displayed 
helps you to figure out what needs to be done to allow the crawler to have 
access.
In a lot of cases, the problem is simply that you have a robots.txt file that 
denies access to certain portions of your page. (Remember this little bugger? 
I tell you all about him in Chapter 3.)
Sometimes, you deny a crawler access to a page on your Web site for good 
reason. For example, if you have several pages that are essentially the same, 
you might not want a crawler to look at all the pages. The redundancy could 
cause your search result rankings to drop. Usually, if you’ve designed your 
site well and with the Google Webmaster Guidelines in mind, you have no 
reason to keep the crawler off any pages of your site.
Sometimes, though, the errors that the crawler encounters aren’t directly 
related to that robots.txt file. If that’s the case, you see the exact error 
listed on this diagnostics form. You can then repair the error. After you do, 
however, it might take up to a week for the crawler to hit your site again. 
You may have to be patient to see the results of your repair.
A good example here is when a crawler can’t navigate your site because 
of broken links. If the crawler can’t follow the site navigational links, it 
will leave your site and come back at another time. If you fix the broken 
links, the next time the crawler comes through you shouldn’t have any 
problems.
Managing Your Account
No two ways about: Part of your day-to-day site administration involves man-
aging your AdSense account. Now, with any Google application out there, 
managing the application or program is pretty straightforward. AdSense is no 
exception.
To manage your account, log in to AdSense and then select the My Account 
tab. From this tab, you have several options for account maintenance, 
including: Account Settings, Account Access, Payment History, and Tax 
Information, as shown in Figure 15-7. I cover each option in greater detail in 
the next sections.

288
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
Figure 15-7: 
Use the My 
Account 
tab to man-
age your 
account 
information.
 
Your account settings
The Account Settings section of the My Account tab lets you add or change 
e-mail addresses and passwords, update your address and payment informa-
tion, and/or change your ad type preference.
To change any of the settings here, click the blue Edit link next to the header 
for that section. When you click this link, a new page opens from which you 
can change the information that’s pertinent to that segment of the Account 
Settings section. After you make whatever changes you want to make, click 
Save to update your account settings.

289
 Chapter 15: Using AdSense Reports
 
The Account Settings section has a Property Information area. The numbers 
shown here are your account IDs for each area of AdSense that you choose 
to use. For example, if you’re using AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, 
and AdSense Referrals, you have three different IDs shown. In most cases, you 
don’t need to know these IDs. Google keeps up with them for you and includes 
them in the code that’s generated for the ads you display.
However, if you ever do need to know them (say, if you’re having trouble 
with your AdSense account and you call tech support), this is where they’re 
located. Don’t share those ID numbers with anyone, though. They’re specific 
to your account, and if you give them out, someone else could gain access to 
your account.
Granting and denying access
The Account Access area on the My Account tab is where you can see who 
else has access to your AdSense account. Unless you specifically grant an 
organization or another person access to the account, you should have no 
one else listed here.
 
If you’re using Blogger or some other applications (such as FeedBurner) 
with AdSense, that organization needs to have access. Keep in mind that the 
company can’t see your earning statements or make changes to your account 
beyond the changes that you authorize while setting up or changing ads. 
They’re still listed as hosts in your Account Access area — someone who is 
hosting your blog, RSS feed, or other aspect of the Web site on which you 
have ads displayed.
You can disable any and all hosting applications at any time by clicking the 
blue Disable Access link to the right of the hosting company’s name. After 
you click that link, however, the account no longer has access to the ele-
ments of your account needed to allow you to show ads through that service; 
so the ads that you have active no longer display, or if they do, they display 
with errors.
Unless you’ve changed your mind about having ads on your blog or in your 
RSS feed, you shouldn’t adjust the status of these hosts. Allow them to have 
the access they need to ensure that your ads continue to display properly.
 
You can’t add multiple users to an AdSense account. You can share your user-
name and password with others but you can’t physically add an additional 
user to your account. If you have an account that you want to share with your 
spouse or partner (or some other member of your staff), he must use your 
login.

290
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
When you allow someone to use your username and password to access your 
AdSense account, she has all the same privileges that you do, meaning she can 
change your account in any way she chooses. She can change ad types and 
placement, she can change reports, and she can even change your password 
and lock you out of the account.
Use caution if you plan to share your account with someone. Make sure it’s 
someone you trust. Better yet, don’t share. I know, you’ve been told all your 
life that sharing is good. In this case though, go ahead and share reports and 
information gleaned from your AdSense account, but keep actual access to 
the account to yourself, just to be on the safe side.
Reading your payment history
The Payment History section of the My Account tab is where you can see 
what your current balance is or what payments have been made to you in the 
past. AdSense doesn’t send out payments until you reach $100, so if you’re 
below that level, the balance carries forward each month until you hit the 
$100 level. Payments can then be issued through check or direct deposit.
 
The View drop-down menu in the Payment History section lets you change the 
months for which you’re viewing your payment history. Your options are Last 
3 Months, Last 12 Months, or All Time.
You should’ve set up your payment method on the Account Settings page 
when you first opened your AdSense account. If you didn’t, AdSense can’t 
pay you, but you can’t change those details on this page, either. This page 
is strictly a reporting page. You have to go to your Account Settings page to 
make changes to your payment method and information.
Next to each month listed on the Payment History page is a blue Details link. 
Click this link to go to a page that details how your earnings are categorized 
(AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, and so on), what the subtotal is, 
and how much your monthly earnings are. You can also download this infor-
mation to a CSV file by clicking the Download CSV File link at the top of the 
Details report (or next to the View drop-down menu on the previous page, as 
shown in Figure 15-8).
Farther down the Payment History page, you also see a payment schedule. 
AdSense payments are sent at the end of each month and are sent either 
by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), Express Secured Delivery, or Standard 
Delivery. The Account Settings area is where you make changes to your pay-
ment delivery method and account numbers if you’re having payments deliv-
ered via EFT.

Giving Uncle Sam his due
I don’t know about you, but I hate paying taxes. I could get on a major soap-
box about the whole tax system, but this isn’t the forum for it. Unfortunately, 
AdSense income, like every other type of income, is taxable. That means 
Google has to have tax-withholding information for you, so before you can be 
paid, you have to fill out an IRS Form W-9.
The first time that you log in to the Tax Information section of the My 
Account tab, you’re prompted to fill out a Form W-9. After you fill it out and 
submit it, you need to worry about it only if there are major changes in your 
life (such as a name change caused by getting married or a change in with-
holding status).
I’m no accountant, so I can’t tell you exactly how you should fill out this form, 
but I can tell you that any time you need to update it, log in to your account, 
go to the Tax Information page, click the blue Change Your Tax Information 
link, and you’re taken to the Tax Information Wizard.
The wizard asks questions about your citizenship, your filing status, and your 
personal information. It’s really a simple process and not nearly as confusing 
as filling out a Form W-9 for your employer.
Walk through the wizard, answer the questions, and then click Finished. Your 
information is updated automatically, and you’ll stay on Uncle Sam’s good 
side, at least where AdSense is concerned. Easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.

 Setting up payments
 Making changes to your payment account
 Adding Web sites to your AdSense account
 Understanding revenue sharing
A
dSense is all about the money, right? As far as I know, that’s the only 
reason to lease advertising space on your Web site or blog. Because 
that’s the case, it’d be nice if you could get paid.
Assuming you’re generating enough income from your AdSense ads, pay-
ments should be sent to you on a monthly basis — after you’ve set up your 
account to receive payments, that is.
Setting Up AdSense Payments
Setting up your AdSense payments is easier now than it used to be. In the 
bad old days, you couldn’t effectively set up your AdSense payments until 
you reached $50 or $100 in revenues. Now, you can set up your payment 
account and payment type almost immediately after you create your AdSense 
account.
Everything you need to do is found on the My Account tab in your AdSense 
account. The first thing you need to do is set up your payment account, so 
follow these steps:
 
1. Point your browser to the AdSense Web site at www.adsense.com.
 
2. Sign in to your AdSense account and then click the My Account tab.
 
 The tab should open to Account Settings, but if it doesn’t, select 
Account Settings from the links below the tab.

3. In the third section of the Account Settings page — the Payee 
Information section — as shown in Figure 16-1, click the Edit link next 
to the Payee Information title.
 
 You’re taken to a page where you can change or update account infor-
mation, such as your name and address. (See Figure 16-2.)

4. Enter your information or make changes to the existing information.
 
 You’re asked to provide your name, address, phone, and fax informa-
tion. You can also choose the best time for someone from AdSense to 
call you. AdSense employees don’t usually call, but this information is 
requested in case a situation develops where the company needs to con-
tact you fast.
 
5. When you’re finished entering your contact information, click the 
Save Changes button.
After you set up your payment account, you still have to verify the account. 
For that, you need a PIN (personal identification number) from AdSense, 
which isn’t sent out to you until you have at least $10 in AdSense revenue. 
(AdSense used to send the PIN out when an account reached $50, but the 
process struck AdSense users as a tad slow — hmm . . . maybe AdSense 
wanted to keep the money for as long as possible? — so the company 
reduced the amount to $10.) When you reach the $100 level, use the PIN to 
authorize a payment to you.
I hear the grumbles already. You have to wait until you make $100 to get 
paid? Yep. The cost of processing payments is pretty high, and in an effort 
to make it less costly, AdSense doesn’t process smaller payments. Think of 
it this way: If they were sending out checks to everyone who made under 
$100 each month, the cost of issuing those checks would explode exponen-
tially. To cover the cost, AdSense would have to cut the percentage that you 
receive for showing their ads, which means you’d make less money.
 
Rather than being aggravated because you aren’t getting paid immediately, 
work to optimize your site and your AdSense income so that you’re generating 
enough revenue to actually get paid as quickly as possible. If you’re not sure 
what you need to do to optimize your Web site to gain the most traffic, flip to 
Chapter 4. I provide a thorough explanation of optimization there.
Selecting how you get paid
Setting up your account for payment is only half of what needs to be done. 
You also have to choose how you want to get paid. With AdSense, you have 
three choices:
 
 Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT): Your AdSense payments can be 
directly deposited into your (U.S.) bank account — after you’re set up to 
receive electronic payments, of course.

296
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
 
 Check-Standard Delivery: Standard delivery checks go out around the 
15th of the month and could take two to three weeks to arrive in your 
mailbox.
 
 Check-Secured Express Delivery: Checks sent Secured Express Delivery 
go out about the 15th of the month, but they’re guaranteed to arrive at 
your doorstep within a week. The rub? It costs you $30 for the privilege.
No matter which form of payment you receive, you still have to make $100 in 
revenues before the payment’s sent to you. If you select EFT, however, you 
can set that up before you reach the $100 cut-off point.
If you’re an International user, you may have two options for payment. 
AdSense will send checks to all supported countries — if you’re not in the 
U.S. and you can use AdSense, then you’re in a supported country — or in 
some countries you can receive an EFT payment. The countries in which EFT 
is available are
Australia
Austria
Belgium
Canada
Czech Republic
Denmark
Finland
France
Germany
Ireland
Israel
Italy
Japan
Mexico
The Netherlands
New Zealand
Norway
Poland
Portugal
Slovakia
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Turkey
United States
United Kingdom
In all of the countries, payment is available in that country’s national currency.
Setting up the EFT account is pretty simple. Follow these steps:
 
1. Point your browser to the AdSense Web site at www.adsense.com.
 
2. Log in to your AdSense account and go to the My Account tab.
 
 If you’re not automatically taken to the Account Settings page, select 
that link below the My Account tab.

297

3. Scroll down to the Payment Details section of the page and click the 
Edit link.
 
4. In the new page that appears, choose the Add a New Bank radio 
button and click Continue.
 
 You are taken to the Bank Account Information page, as shown in 
Figure 16-3.
 
5. In the Bank Account Information page, enter your bank account infor-
mation and then click Continue.
 
 Your account information is checked automatically to ensure that it’s 
accurate. If everything is correct, you receive a confirmation message.
 
6. Wait.
 
 You have to wait a few days — four to ten days to be exact — for 
AdSense to make a small deposit — the amount varies, but it could be 
anything up to about $1 — into your account.
 
7. After you receive your initial deposit, log back in to your account and 
return to the Payment Details section of the Account Settings page.
 
8. Enter the deposit amount in the Deposit Amount field and then click 
the Confirm button.
 
 That last click does it; you’re set up for direct deposits.

Part IV: AdSense Administration 
If you prefer to have your payments made the old-fashioned way — by 
check — all you have to do is log on to the Payment Details section of the 
Account Settings page and select one of the check options. If you happen to 
live outside the U.S., you don’t have any choice but to receive your payment 
by check.
Hold, please . . .
My life is nuts. I’ve moved every couple years for most of my life, and even as 
an adult, I still find myself moving more often than anyone I know. We’re not 
talking little moves, either. If I’m moving, it’s across state lines.
Moving across state lines means things have to change — addresses, tele-
phone numbers, and even bank accounts. When it’s time for me to make 
these kinds of moves, I have to put direct payments on hold. My agency is 
accustomed to it, but sometimes I have to juggle other payments (or bills). 
AdSense isn’t one of those companies that I have to worry about.
AdSense gives you the ability to place your payments on hold indefinitely. 
“Indefinitely” could mean a lot of different things to you, but during that time 
you don’t have to worry about your payments bouncing around cyberspace 
while you’re getting your banking details under control (or while you’re on 
vacation or whatever).
To put your payments on hold, do the following:
 
1. Log in to your Account Settings page.
 
2. Click the Edit link next to the Payment Holding section of the page.
 
3. On the new page that appears, select the Hold Payment check box.
 
4. Click the Save Changes button.
Now your payments are on hold until you return to the page and deselect the 
Hold Payment check box.
Your money doesn’t disappear into no-man’s land, either. While on hold, pay-
ments simply accrue. Then, when you reactivate payments, you’re paid the 
full amount during the next regular billing cycle.
The exception to how these holds and payments work (there’s always an 
exception, isn’t there?) is around the 15th of the month. If you make changes 
to your payment status, payment account, or payment type around the 15th 
of the month, everything gets a little squirrelly.

299
 Chapter 16: AdSense Revenues 
According to the AdSense Web site, holds placed or released around the 15th 
of the month may or may not process that month. The best thing you can do 
is try to make adjustments to your payment details around the beginning or 
end of the month. If you have to make adjustments after about the 10th or 
before the 20th, watch your account to make sure the changes take effect.
Changing your payment account
Changing your EFT payment account, unlike changing your underwear, isn’t 
something that you’ll do every day. However, you will have situations (like 
getting a new account or getting married) when you’ll need to change the 
account that your deposits are made to. Changing the account is easy:
 
1. Log in to your AdSense account and go to the My Account tab to be 
taken to the Account Settings page.
 
2. Scroll down to Payment Details.
 
3. Click the Edit link, enter the details for your new account, and then 
click the Save Changes button.
 
 You’re good to go.
You have to go through the same verification process — waiting for a deposit 
from AdSense and then entering the deposit amount on the verification page — 
but then your account will be active, and you can delete the old account. Just 
like setting up your first account, though, the process can take four to ten days.
To delete an account:
 
1. Log in to your AdSense account and click the My Account tab to be 
taken to the Account Settings page.
 
2. On the Account Setting page, scroll down to Payment Details and click 
the Edit link.
 
 This will take you to the Choose Form of Payment page.
 
3. Select the radio button next to the account that you want to delete and 
click the Continue button.
 
 Doing so takes you to the Account Editing page.
 
4. On the Account Editing page, click the Delete this account button.
 
 You may be prompted to confirm your desire to delete the account. 
Then the page reloads and you see a confirmation message.
That’s all there is to it. Just remember that if you delete an account that you 
don’t really want to delete, you have to go through the confirmation process 
all over again.

Part IV: AdSense Administration 
Adding Sites to Your AdSense Account
As uptight as Google can be about the sites that display AdSense ads, you’ll 
find this next little bit hard to believe — I did.
Many people (myself included) have more than one Web site or blog. 
Because AdSense only allows you to have one account, if you want ads on all 
your sites, you need to have multiple sites listed on your AdSense account, 
right? Wrong. You only need to have the one site that you listed when you 
first created your AdSense account.
Then, all you have to do is create your ads and copy and paste the code 
onto whatever Web site you choose. Really. Of course, that makes it a little 
confusing if you want to track your earnings by site, but AdSense even has an 
answer to that conundrum.
Use channels. (If you read Chapter 15, you might remember the details I gave 
you about channels.) Well, this is where channels are really the most useful. 
When you have multiple Web sites that you want to place AdSense ads on — 
but you want to be able to track them all separately — use different channels 
for each site.
Creating channels is easy:
 
1. Log in to your AdSense account and go to the AdSense Setup tab.
 
2. Select Channels and then select the type of ad that you want to create 
a channel for (AdSense for Content, Search, Referrals, and so on).
 
3. Click the Add New Custom Channels link, type the desired name for 
your channel, and click Add Channel.
See? I told you it’s easy.
After you have channels set up and you create an ad, choose the channel that 
you want to use to track it, and then that linkage is built into the code. When 
you’re ready to track your ads, you can view reports by channel.
 
Don’t feel compelled to add multiple Web sites to your AdSense account to 
keep your revenues separate. All you have to do is create channels that let 
you track which site generates which revenue. To make it a little easier, you 
can also track everything together so you have a consolidated view of how 
much you’re making.

301
 Chapter 16: AdSense Revenues 
Sharing AdSense Revenues
People who publish AdSense ads on their Web sites are always working to 
find new ways to increase their earnings from AdSense ads. Usually, that 
means creating new Web sites and blogs and then populating them with con-
tent. That’s followed by upkeep on those sites, and over time it becomes a 
full-time j-o-b.
Not everyone has time to keep up with all that, so some people who publish 
AdSense ads on their Web sites have come up with an innovative way to 
show AdSense ads without investing so much time and effort. This innovative 
way is AdSense Revenue Sharing, and it’s just this side of legal, according to 
the AdSense Program Policy.
AdSense Revenue Sharing is usually accomplished by setting up a forum in 
which different people from around the world can contribute. Forums are 
the message board systems you find all over the Web, and they tend to rank 
pretty well in Google search results because they’re usually very narrowly 
focused, and they change their content often, which is why so many sites 
now have them.
The forum owners set up the forums so that users who also publish AdSense ads 
can enter their AdSense account number to show their AdSense ads — based on 
the number of times that the person wanting to publish their AdSense ads starts 
and responds to threads within the forum.
For example, if you were to sign up to participate in the forum on Flixya.
com — a video-, photo-, and blog-sharing service — you could include your 
AdSense Publisher ID during the sign-up process. Then, each time you post 
on the site, AdSense ads could potentially be shown in association with your 
post. The percentage of times your ads are shown is usually determined by 
the forum owner and is dependent upon how you post — meaning how rele-
vant your posts are to the topic that you’re posting in — how often you post, 
and what your status is — or how much you contribute to the community.
When your ads are shown on these sites, and other site visitors click through 
them, you receive either a percentage of the earnings or all the earnings, 
depending on how the site is set up. Flixya.com actually allows AdSense pub-
lishers to keep all their AdSense revenues.
Of course, if you’re using this method to show your AdSense ads, you’re also 
showing them against the site owner’s ads. The site owner will most certainly 
run her own ads the majority of the time. If you’re looking for a way to boost 
your income though, this might help — a little.

302
Part IV: AdSense Administration 
Your earnings from these types of AdSense Revenue Sharing schemes aren’t 
high. The earnings might be enough to buy you a sandwich from the Dollar 
Menu now and again, but you certainly won’t get rich with ad-sharing pro-
grams. For starters, posting often enough to keep your ads in front of visitors 
is a full-time job. Second, you’re not the only person showing ads at any given 
time, so the competition for visitors’ clicks is pretty high.
The thin, red line
Another small problem with the AdSense Revenue Sharing scheme is the 
whole concept of you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours that comes along with 
it. What I mean is that, in most of these forums, it’s implied that if you click 
my ads, I’ll click yours. That’s skating very close to the thin ice warnings that 
Google puts out about enticing others to click your ads.
Google expressly forbids in their program policies asking other people to 
click your ads or anything on your site that could be construed as trying to 
coerce others to click your ads. Placing your ads in these forums could be 
construed as that kind of activity.
Google doesn’t have any policy about your ads not appearing on other 
people’s Web sites, though. As long as nothing’s implicit on the site that 
instructs users to click ads, you’re safe.
Participating in revenue sharing
You can participate in revenue sharing in two ways. You can sign up with 
a site that already offers a revenue sharing program and then provide your 
AdSense Publisher ID and start posting to forums, or you can create your 
own site and revenue sharing program that other people sign up for.
Option A is a cinch. All you have to do is sign up. Option B, however, is 
another matter, which is why I spend a bit more time discussing it. Option B 
requires that you first create the Web site and then add forums to that site. 
If you’re a Web site designer, it might not be as difficult for you as it’d be for 
me because I’m no Web designer. I can do just enough to get me by.
If you’re like me, you’re best served by hiring someone to create the forums 
for your site. In the process of designing them, you need to put into place 
an AdSense serving application that rotates through the Web sites of people 
who publish AdSense ads according to how they post on your site.

303
 Chapter 16: AdSense Revenues 
If you’re creating this type of site, I suggest saving your AdSense ads for the 
main body of your site. Include them in your site content but keep them off 
the forum, which is where your posters’ ads are running.
After you have the forum up and running, get word out. Plenty of other 
people who publish AdSense ads are all too happy to post in your forum for 
the chance to have their ads shown. Just make sure you have your program 
policies, outlining how and when ads are shown, posted clearly for publish-
ers to find. If you’re not sure what to include, check out some of the other 
AdSense Revenue Sharing programs on the Web. A quick Google search turns 
up hundreds of them.
Just remember that the point of having forums isn’t necessarily just to pub-
lish your AdSense ads or to allow others to publish theirs. It’s to provide a 
place where your site visitors can go to find the answers they seek on a spe-
cific topic. Set up your forums with that goal in mind, and you’ll be able to 
create a whole new way to generate income.
In general, though, what should be included in your program policies are 
guidelines on how often forum posters need to post, where and how they 
should post, and how long they must be a member or how many posts 
they must have before their ads start showing. Spell out these policies very 
clearly. For example, some forum owners require that forum posters who 
want to have their AdSense ads shown should have been a member of the 
forum for three months or have at least 50 high-quality posts — posts that 
were on-topic and that provided useful information to a majority of the users 
for that message board — before their ads are shown. These owners also 
divide (by percentage) how much of a chance posters have of their ads show-
ing if they start a thread, end a thread, or are topic administrators.
In general, the AdSense Revenue Sharing plan could be a good idea for driv-
ing traffic to your site, but I don’t see it as being a good way to generate a lot 
of AdSense revenue. I really think it’s a waste of time for you to spend that 
much time either building a forum and drawing publishers to it or participat-
ing on message boards where your ads may or may not be shown.
Personally, I spend more of my time generating great content for my own 
sites, building a community of users who know they can find what they need 
on my site, and tweaking my AdSense ads on my own site. That’s my personal 
preference, but if you prefer to participate in an AdSense Revenue Sharing 
program, I wish you luck. I hope that it turns out to be lucrative for you.

Why would you want to though? You have dozens of great tools available to 
you that can help shortcut the learning process and jumpstart the earning

AdSense Sandbox
www.labnol.org/google-adsense-sandbox
The AdSense Sandbox is a great preview tool. If you want to see what types of 
Google AdSense ads will appear on a page — based on the type of content on 
that page — this tool does a pretty good job of showing you, even if it’s not 
100 percent accurate.
To get AdSense Sandbox to work for you, go to their Web site and enter the 
URL of the page you want to see ads for. Alternatively, you could just enter 
specific keywords that you have in mind.
The result is a list of up to 20 AdSense ads that relate to that URL or keyword.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
AdSense Preview Tool
www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.
py?answer=10005&topic=160
AdSense Sandbox (see the preceding section) is third-party software, unaffili-
ated with Google AdSense. The AdSense preview tool, however, is an official 
Google application that, like AdSense Sandbox, allows you to see what types 
of ads might appear on new Web pages that you’ve created. You can then use 
this information to decide whether you want to add AdSense to that page.
With the AdSense preview tool, you can also check the destination of ads 
that are on any of your Web pages, view how the formats and colors of ads 
will appear on your page, and see what ads users in other countries will see.
The preview tool requires that you install a registry file on your computer. To 
do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Web page listed at the beginning of this section and find the 
AdSense Preview Tool link.
 
2. Right-click the link and choose Save Target As from the menu that 
appears.
 
3. Save the registry file to a location where you can find it on your hard 
drive.
 
 I suggest saving it to your My Document file or to your Desktop.
 
4. Double-click the file after the download completes.
 
 A confirmation window appears.
 
5. Select Yes in the confirmation window to update the registry.
 
 The registry file is a self-installing file, so you don’t have to search for 
the correct place in the registry to place the file.
 
6. After the installation is complete, restart your Internet Explorer 
window so the installation can take effect.
That’s all there is to installing the preview tool. After the tool’s installed, you 
can use it by right-clicking in any Web page. From the menu that appears, 
choose Google AdSense Preview Tool to launch the preview tool. When it’s 
launched, you can see the ads in the new window and even click your own 
ads without fear of inciting Google’s ire. As long as you’re in the Preview 
window, clicks don’t count.

309
 Chapter 17: Ten (Plus Two) Must-Have Tools for AdSense
Note, however, that should you ever decide to uninstall the preview tool, 
the best way to do it is with the AdSense Preview Tool Uninstaller, available 
through the AdSense Help Center (www.google.com/adsense/support). 
Also note that the AdSense preview tool only works with Microsoft Windows 
Internet Explorer 6.0 and higher.
AdSense Calculator
www.seochat.com/seo-tools/adsense-calculator
If you’ve ever wondered how statistics, such as daily page impressions, 
click-through-rates (CTR), or cost-per-clicks (CPC), affect the amount of your 
AdSense earnings, here’s a tool that helps you figure it all out.
To use the AdSense Calculator, enter any or all of the values and then click 
Calculate. For example, I entered the following values:
Daily page impressions: 1000
Click-through-rate: 1.5%
Cost-per-click: $.06
These are numbers that I mostly pulled from the air for an example. The excep-
tion is the 1.5 percent click-through-rate. Experts estimate that 1.5 percent is 
the average CTR for AdSense ads.
My results are
Daily earnings: $.90
Monthly earnings: $27.00
Yearly earnings: $328.50
Daily clicks: 15
Monthly clicks: 450
Yearly clicks: 5,475
In other words, if I have an average of 1,000 daily impressions and an aver-
age cost-per-click of $.06, I would see the results in this list as the average 
amount of clicks and earnings that I could receive in the given amount of 
time. Figuring this out isn’t an exact science, but it gives you a pretty good 
idea of what you could earn on your Web site if certain conditions are met.

on the status bar of your browser and updates those stats automatically.
To install the Notifier, go to the Web address in the beginning of this sec-
tion and click Install Now. A software installation dialog box pops up. Allow 
the dialog box to load completely and then click Install Now. The installa-
tion takes a few seconds and then you’re prompted to restart your Firefox

AdSense Heat Maps

py?answer=17954&topic=8970
Heat maps, like the one shown in Figure 17-1, are maps that show the 
best placement for your ads on a given Web site. The link here leads to 
Google’s suggested best placement. However, it only takes certain factors 
into consideration. For example, this site has no consideration for scrolling 
Web pages.
Another resource for heat maps that might be more useful is
www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/internet/google-heatmap-2.htm
These heat maps show some of the different variations that you might need 
to take into consideration due to the unique nature of your Web pages — 
variations like scrolling pages and different navigational structures. Just 
remember, this isn’t an exact science. Test everything before you make any 
final decisions about what works best on your particular site for your particu-
lar audience.

AdSense Accelerator
www.adsenseaccelerator.com
This is the first tool featured here that’s not free. At $47 a month, this may be 
more than you’re ready to invest in if you’re just getting started in AdSense. 
However, if you’re looking for ways to build a Web site based on high-paying 
keywords, you may want to make the investment.
The AdSense Accelerator shows the bids for the top-ten placement ads on 
Google. You can then use this information to ensure that you’re targeting the 
right keywords — which aren’t necessarily the top ten. Keep this in mind: 
Just because a keyword is in the top ten doesn’t mean that it’s the right key-
word for you to target.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Basing your Web pages on the highest-paying keywords is a constant frus-
tration because those keywords change daily. However, you can use the 
AdSense Accelerator to figure out which keywords consistently pay out at 
higher rates.
No contract’s involved, so I suggest trying it out for at least a month to dis-
cover more about what you could do to improve keyword targeting for the 
ads that you want to display on your Web pages.
AdWords Traffic Estimator and Bid Tool
https://adwords.google.com/select/trafficEstimatorSandbox
Remember AdWords? That’s the advertising side of AdSense. AdWords is 
the program that advertisers use to place the ads that you show on your 
Web site using the AdSense program. The AdWords Traffic Estimator and 
Bid Tool is actually an AdWords tool, but because AdSense is the other side 
of AdWords, you may find it useful to help determine which high-paying key-
words you should be targeting with your Web site.
It works simply enough. Enter a few bits of information into the form 
provided — information like keywords, bid amount, and targeting location — 
and then the program generates a report that shows you how much traffic can 
be expected for an ad based around the keywords you provided. Here’s how 
to use it:
 
1. Log in to the Web site listed at the beginning of this section.
 
2. Enter a list of keywords that you want to target in the text box pro-
vided, as shown in Figure 17-2.
 
3. Enter a maximum cost-per-click in the Choose a Currency section.
 
 You may have to use your imagination here, but don’t choose a cost-
per-click that’s too low or too high. Instead, think in terms of an average 
cost. There are no averages for what users can expect to pay for the use 
of a keyword, but my suggestion is to use a figure that’s no less than $1 
per click and no more than $10 per click. You want to keep your options 
as wide open as possible, but you can also experiment with the numbers 
to see what you find.
 
4. (Optional) Enter a daily budget.
 
 I don’t usually bother with this. I leave this blank so that I’m not limited 
by the hypothetical budget because a daily budget is really only relevant 
if you’re planning to use the AdWords service where you pay to have 
your ads placed on Web sites.

You’ll see Average CPC, Estimated Clicks Per Day, and Estimated Cost

Use the statistics that are returned to get a feel for which keywords you have 
under consideration that will pay the highest in terms of CPC and cost-per-
impression. Again, it’s not an exact science, but getting a feel for what adver-
tisers are paying helps you better understand what you can expect (very 
roughly) as far as earnings are concerned.

Keyword Tools
https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal
The AdWords Keyword Tool is designed to help you generate new keywords, 
based on the words or phrases that you enter into the keyword generator. 
This is another of those tools that, although it was built specifically with 
AdWords in mind, might also prove useful for AdSense types as well.
One particularly useful feature of the Keyword Tool is that it lets you enter 
the URL of a specific Web site to see what keywords are generated, according 
to the content of the site. With it, you can enter the URL of the page you’re 
optimizing for AdSense ads to see what keywords are being recognized on 
that page.
The Keyword Tool is a great way to make sure that your page is being recog-
nized for the keyword ads you’re targeting. As an added bonus, it has a neat 
little progress meter at the bottom that processes while it’s examining the 
page that you entered. I know . . . small things for small minds, which mine 
definitely is at times!
The results that are returned when the page is finished processing are pretty 
comprehensive. You’ll probably see the keywords you’re targeting as well as 
some that you hadn’t thought of. All in all, a very useful tool.
Keyword-Ranking Tools
http://freekeywords.wordtracker.com
If you’re looking for something to complement the Google AdWords Keyword 
Tool, try the keyword-ranking tool from WordTracker. This keyword-ranking 
tool works much like the Google tool with a few minor differences.
The most noticeable difference between the WordTracker version and the 
AdWords Keyword Tool are that WordTracker only lets you generate key-
words by plugging in a word or phrase — it doesn’t allow you to generate 
keywords based on a Web site URL, in other words. WordTracker does, how-
ever, show you the estimated daily search volume for the keywords shown.
Oh, WordTracker also doesn’t offer a cool progress meter. WordTracker 
makes up for this, though, by knowing how many times each day a certain 
keyword is searched for because the number of daily searches is a clear indi-
cator of what’s popular. If your site’s based on a set of keywords that ranks 
low in the results, a simple change of keywords might bring more success for 
your AdSense ads.

Sitemaps
https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/docs/en/
sitemapgenerator.html
The Google sitemap generator is an application that examines your Web site 
and creates a sitemap based on the structure of the site. “But why do I need a 
sitemap?” you ask.
Simple. A sitemap is the easiest way to get Google to crawl all the nooks and 
crannies of your site. The problem is that the sitemap generator is a little dif-
ficult to use.
First, you have to download the sitemap generator from the Web site listed 
at the top of this section, and then you have to create a configuration file for 
the sitemap. After that, you need to upload specific files to your Web site, run 
the sitemap generator program, add the sitemap to your Google Webmaster 
account, and set the process up to be repeated.
Those steps are a tough process to get through. If you’re really relying on 
Google when it comes to your search engine ranking, though, this sitemap 
generator is worth the time and effort.
If you’re okay with using a different sitemap generator, however, you might find 
the XML Sitemap Generator (www.xml-sitemaps.com) a little easier to use.
All you have to do with the XML Sitemap Generator is enter the URL, wait for 
the program to process, and then download the resulting file to your com-
puter. After that’s done, log in to your Google Webmaster account, add the 
sitemap URL, and you’re good to go.
The sitemap is a tool — not a requirement. If you have a large site, you may 
find that your AdSense results for deep pages are much better if you have a 
sitemap in place to lead search engines to the pages.
AdSense Blog
http://adsense.blogspot.com
If you want to stay on top of what’s happening with AdSense, the AdSense 
blog is the place to do it. This blog is updated a couple times a week (some-
times more) with tips about using AdSense smarter or with news about 
AdSense that might affect you.
Several people from the AdSense team work on the blog, so the voices are as 
varied as the information that you get.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Add it to your RSS — this usually requires adding the blog URL to your RSS 
reader, but the steps vary depending on the reader that you’re using — 
because it’s always nice to know what’s going on in AdSense Land.
AdSense Help Group
http://groups.google.com/group/adsense-help
The AdSense Help files add up to a pretty comprehensive document. Like 
other aspects of Google Help, the Help files can be a little circular at times, 
and it’s certain that it won’t answer all your questions. When you need 
an answer that you can’t find, the AdSense Help Group — through Google 
Groups — is a useful list to be involved in.
Post your questions to the list, and other listers — or sometimes the modera-
tors themselves — provide answers if they’re out there to be had. Don’t be 
discouraged if it takes a little time to get an answer, though. Everyone on the 
list seems a little busy, so answers can occasionally take days or even weeks 
to come by. Most of the time, though, you’ll have your answer in a much 
shorter time.

Ten AdSense Don’ts
In This Chapter
 Creating Web sites for people — not for ads
 Avoiding less-than-ethical practices
 Distinguishing best practices from deceptive actions
T
he list of activities that you can use to improve your AdSense revenues is 
long and involved, but so is the list of strategies that you should avoid. In 
that list, however, some stand out far more than others.
What follows is a list of the top-ten practices that you should avoid when cre-
ating your Web site and implementing your AdSense ads. Somewhere along 
the line someone likely told you that you should try one of the practices 
listed here.
Don’t do it. The results might be nice for a while. You could temporarily 
bump up your AdSense revenues. However, over time, the risks become 
much higher, and ultimately, you’ll probably end up getting caught by 
Google, which results in losing the privilege to show AdSense ads — and the 
right to earn AdSense revenues.
Ultimately, it’s just not worth the risk.
Don’t Build Your Web Site for AdSense
If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a dozen times in this book: Don’t build your 
Web site for AdSense. AdSense is about getting advertisements in front of 
users. Google has to get those ads out there because the advertisers that are 
using AdWords — the advertising arm of Google, where advertisers can place 
their ads to be shown on Web sites like yours — are paying the company to 
do so. If you build your Web site exclusively for AdSense, the only thing that 
sees the ads is the crawler that periodically takes stock of your pages.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Build your site for actual, real, live visitors instead. You know, those people 
sitting on the other side of the computer screen? They play with the key-
board and mouse, and they’re looking for something that they hope to find 
on your Web site. They’re visitors, and they’re your site’s target. The more 
specific the type of visitor, the better.
When you build your site for visitors, you have to put serious thought into 
how the visitor will use the site. Think about what draws him to your site 
first. If he’s searching for information or products, what keywords will he use 
to search? If he’s randomly typing in a Web address, what address will he 
use? (Don’t laugh. It happens. I usually try the direct URL method of search-
ing before I go to a search engine.)
After you get the user to your site, the next consideration is what he’ll do 
while he’s there. This is where your AdSense considerations come into play, 
because when the user’s on the site, you want AdSense to be a natural part of 
the site for him. Only when you build a site this way — for the visitor first 
and foremost — will you find that you have success with AdSense.
 
When you build the site exclusively for AdSense, you’re also in the position of 
being banned from the AdSense program. Google wants visitors to click ads. 
Your job, as someone who publishes AdSense ads, is to ensure that AdSense 
ads are displayed to as many potential clicks — that would be visitors — as 
possible. That means putting visitors first, always.
Don’t Cut Corners
This rule is sort of a fall-back to don’t build your site for AdSense. When you 
cut corners on your site, you take out all the elements that make people want 
to visit the site. For example, cutting a corner would be using the same tired 
articles that many other Web site owners are also using. Don’t do it. Users 
quickly figure out that your site doesn’t contain quality content, and they’ll 
move on to the next site.
Instead, take your time to create the best possible Web site to meet the need 
your site was designed to meet. If you’re peddling information about kanga-
roo farms, be the most comprehensive site on the Web about the topic. If 
you’re selling pogo sticks, not only should you include a variety of different 
models, but you should also include information that’s of value to your cus-
tomers, including how to care for the pogo stick, what types of tournaments 
there might be, what associations there are, and what kind of creative activi-
ties involve pogo sticks.
Give your visitors everything they’re looking for. This creates return visitors and 
great word-of-mouth traffic (or buzz), which work together to increase the 
amount of exposure for your AdSense ads. The more times people look at those 
ads, the more likely they are to click them and increase your revenue stream.

319
 Chapter 18: Ten AdSense Don’ts
Don’t Hide Your Ads
I know it sounds crazy, but some people do hide their ads. What they do is 
hide the text of the ad, leaving only the URL visible in an attempt to make vis-
itors think that the URL is part of a list of links or a blog roll — the list of links 
to other blogs that you (as a blog owner) recommend. Do I need to tell you 
that Google frowns on this practice?
You might think hiding the nature of your links sounds like a great idea, espe-
cially in the context of blending your ads into your Web pages as much as 
possible, but it’s not. Don’t be fooled if someone tells you she’s done this and 
it worked well for her.
If you try it and Google catches any indications that you’re doing something 
deceptive like this, you’ll be banned from the AdSense program. What’s 
more, you could also be excluded from search results generated by the 
Google search engine.
If you intend to show AdSense ads on your Web site, let them be seen. You 
can blend them with the other text on the page or even make the back-
grounds the same color as your page background. Don’t hide the text leaving 
only the link visible. It might garner you a few clicks in the beginning, but the 
end results could be disastrous.
Don’t Click Your Own Ads
Of all the no-nos you hear about AdSense, this is the most important one. 
Don’t click your own ads. Clicking your own ads might seem like just the thing 
to do. After all, you don’t want ads on your site that you don’t know where 
they lead, and it wouldn’t hurt to bump your income just a touch.
Hold it just a minute! That’s completely the wrong way to think about it. If 
everyone could just click their own ads and run up their profits, life would 
indeed be grand, but clicking your own ads is a form of click fraud. Click fraud 
is when you fraudulently drive up the number of ad clicks from people (your-
self included) who aren’t actually interested in whatever the ad promises.
See, AdSense only works if AdWords works, and AdWords only works if 
people are truly interested in the ads that AdWords users create. AdWords 
users place their ads for people to see, and Web site owners who use 
AdSense then publish the ads for their Web site visitors to view and (hope-
fully) click. If no one clicks the ads, AdWords users aren’t charged a fee for 
placing the ad and AdSense users aren’t paid for placing the ads. If someone 
does click through the ads but never makes a purchase or completes a trans-
action with the advertiser, advertisers will quit using AdWords and people 

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
like you who want to make money from showing ads will have no ads to dis-
play. Make sense?
When you click your own ads, you’re not usually interested in the content of 
the ad. That said, I admit that I’ve clicked one of my own ads because I truly 
was interested in what it was advertising. Of course, I realized my mistake 
almost instantly, and I never clicked one again. If I see an ad I’m interested in, 
I go directly to the URL that’s provided.
I understand that you probably want to know where your ads lead. I don’t 
blame you, and neither does Google. That’s why there are tools, such as the 
AdSense preview tool — the AdSense extension for Firefox that lets you pre-
view how ads appear on your page and where those ads lead to. (For more 
on the AdSense preview tool, see Chapter 17.)
The AdSense preview tool is a free tool, and when you use it as directed, you 
can click the ads on your own pages without fear of repercussions. What 
repercussions you might ask? Getting banned from AdSense, of course!
Don’t Change the AdSense Code
This one is right up there with the AdSense Don’t in the preceding section. 
Don’t change the AdSense code. Google takes creating AdSense code very 
seriously. Although a program generates the code for your Web site, that 
program is constantly tweaked and improved (just like everything Google).
The code AdSense generates for you is exactly what Google needs to provide 
the ads that will appear on your Web page as well as to track the results to 
those ads, which are important factors.
Keep in mind that AdSense works only because AdWords works (or it could be 
that AdWords works because AdSense works; which came first, the chicken or 
the egg?). The only way to prove that either one of them works is in the track-
ing that Google does. For that tracking to be accurate, the code provided to 
make ads appear on your Web site must remain intact, as written.
The only exceptions to this are changing style elements of the code, such as 
colors, and that should be done only with the AdSense code generator. If you 
create an ad and then re-design your site to have different colors, you can 
always go back to AdSense and edit the ad that you’ve created. If you’re 
thinking of messing with anything that’s not style related, however, don’t — 
it’s just not worth the grief that you get.
What is that grief? Say it with me: Getting banned from the AdSense program.

321
 Chapter 18: Ten AdSense Don’ts
Don’t Use Clickbots
Remember click fraud from a few paragraphs ago? Clickbots are another way 
to commit click fraud. A clickbot is a script or program that’s designed to 
click the ads on your page, and they’re readily available on the Web, usually 
inexpensively.
Just because clickbots are there doesn’t mean you should use them, though. 
Clickbots do the same thing that you’d do if you were clicking your own ads, 
except on a much larger scale. They inflate the revenue that’s generated with-
out increasing the interest in the product or service that’s being advertised.
Now, a common misconception is that people only use clickbots to click their 
own ads — not true. Some people have been caught using clickbots to click 
other people’s ads, too. These people are usually AdWords advertisers who 
are trying to push their competition out of the way.
See, each time someone clicks an ad, it costs the advertiser a set amount of 
money. A clickbot can click an ad dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of 
times, driving up the cost of the ad. This can affect how many times an ad is 
shown in a given period of time, and it can also cost an advertiser a large 
amount of money. After the budget limit is reached, that advertiser is out of 
the way until the next billing cycle, allowing the next highest bidders to have 
their ads shown more often.
Clickbots form a vicious cycle that can be very costly for the person or com-
pany that falls victim to this type of click fraud. If you’re the one committing 
it, both AdSense and AdWords will ban you from their programs.
Don’t Get Banned for Taboo Content
Taboo content — content that Google’s deemed inappropriate for all 
audiences — is another way to end up on the bad side of AdSense. 
Examples include content that refers to
 
 Certain weapons, including guns
 
 Illegal drugs
 
 Alcohol
 
 Tobacco
 
 Pornography
 
 Designer knock-offs

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If your Web site contains these types of content, AdSense doesn’t want ads 
displayed on it for one simple reason — image. Google, AdWords, AdSense, 
and all the other arms of Google have an image to uphold. Placing ads for 
goods or services on inappropriate sites isn’t the way to do that.
Google has to screen some of the Web sites on which AdSense ads will 
appear. If you have a site that’s likely to be offensive to a large number of 
people because it contains any of the content listed earlier, AdSense denies 
your request to put ads there.
Some folks think it’s smart to put the ads on their site and then later change 
the site and add disagreeable content to it — bad move. If you’re using 
AdSense and the crawler finds this type of content on your site, you’re asked to 
remove the content, and if you don’t, you can be banned from the program.
If your site contains any of the topics listed in this section, you might want to 
look to other affiliate and advertising programs for ways to generate a reve-
nue stream.
Don’t Hold Clicking Contests
Here’s another facet of click fraud. Clicking contests are conducted when 
someone who publishes AdSense ads creates a contest for which site visitors 
must click an ad to qualify. The contest is usually monitored with a second-
ary script that the Web site owner creates.
This artificially inflates the number of clicks that you receive on your 
AdSense ads, driving up the revenues that your site generates. This is bad for 
two reasons.
First, you’re creating an artificial bump in revenues. That means to maintain 
that level of revenue, you have to come up with increasingly creative ways to 
get people to click your AdSense ads until you’ve reached the point of out-
right fraud. Never good.
Second, artificially inflating the number of times that someone clicks one of 
your ads causes the system to be skewed on the Google side, too. The adver-
tisers have to pay more for advertising. Even more troublesome though is 
that your site could be taken as a site that generates a lot of traffic and so 
might benefit from a cost-per-impression ad.
Great news for you if you have a ton of traffic, but if you don’t, you could end 
up on the losing end of that proposition. Being limited to cost-per-impression 
ads also means that the advertisers that are specifically targeting your site 
lose out. In turn, Google loses out on potential revenues.

323
 Chapter 18: Ten AdSense Don’ts
Now, you may not give a flying flip about the other people and companies in 
the mix, but you should care that if you get caught using this kind of tactic to 
increase your AdSense revenues, you’ll lose your AdSense privileges.
Don’t Pay Others to Click Your Ads
Here’s another one that falls into the same category as not using clickbots or 
holding clicking contests. Don’t pay other people to click your ads.
These kinds of programs are sometimes billed as affiliate programs. People 
who put them together offer a portion of their revenues to a person or group 
of people who in turn click their AdSense ads. That’s all great, and it might 
even work for a little while, but eventually someone will squeal or Google will 
catch on.
The penalties for falsely inflating your AdSense revenues can be stiff. You can 
(of course) possibly lose your AdSense privileges, but there’s a darker side to 
click fraud if you get caught with your hand deep enough in the cookie jar. 
Google has been known to prosecute people who commit click fraud, espe-
cially in cases that are considered extreme.
The best strategy for increasing your AdSense revenue and maintaining that 
revenue long-term is to do it by-the-book. Use the strategies I talk about in 
this book — all the chapters include some kind of strategy that should help 
you increase your revenues — and avoid anything that can get you into hot 
water with Google. Because you’ve gone about building your AdSense busi-
ness the right way, you’ll continue to see returns on your AdSense efforts for 
a long time to come.
Don’t Use Any Other Underhanded 
Methods
Click fraud is just one of the underhanded methods that some people use to 
increase their AdSense revenues. Whether you’re using click fraud or some 
other deceptive practice doesn’t matter though. If you’re trying to get the 
upper-hand on Google, you’ll probably fail.
That doesn’t keep some people from recommending the wrong methods of 
increasing Web site traffic and therefore increasing AdSense revenues. What 
do these people care if you’re kicked out of the AdSense program? You get-
ting kicked out doesn’t affect them at all.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
It’s much smarter to avoid anything that seems less than honest. I talk about 
some of the methods that you might see recommended — but that you 
should never try — in the list here:
 
 Cloaking: By putting one set of content in front of a search engine 
crawler and then presenting users with another set of content, cloaking 
deceives potential site visitors into believing they’re entering one type 
of site when in fact they’re entering another.
 
 Cloaking can apply to AdSense, too. If you’re using cloaking techniques, 
you could be baiting AdSense ads for extremely high-paying keywords, 
but the content on your site doesn’t relate to those keywords at all. Site 
visitors click into your site, but because they don’t find what they’re 
looking for, they often click the ads that are displayed instead.
 
 Cloaking is a bad practice that Google figures out very quickly. When 
they do, you pay the price for your deception — as in, kiss your mem-
bership in the AdSense program goodbye.
 
 Duplicate content: No one wants to see the same boring stuff all over 
again — just like no one wants to watch reruns on TV — which is why 
I’m always recommending that you use as much unique, fresh content as 
you can generate, rather than loading up your site with content found 
elsewhere.
 
 What makes duplicate content so troublesome for AdSense is that if 
dozens of sites all carry the same content, a limited number of relevant 
ads can be shown on those sites. Duplicate content can also indicate 
that a Web site isn’t regularly updated, meaning that it won’t have as 
much traffic as a site that maintains dynamic content.
 
 Google wants AdSense (and AdWords) to be successful. So, naturally, the 
more diverse the sites are within a topic, the more ads that can be shown. 
Although duplicate content probably won’t get you banned from AdSense, 
it certainly reduces the effectiveness of your site and value of the ads that 
are shown on the site. You know what that means: less revenue.
 
 Hidden text: This is yet another “helpful hint” you may have suggested 
to you in the context of improving the AdSense ads that appear on your 
site. Hidden text involves text that, while present on your site, is colored 
the same as the background so that it blends into the site and isn’t seen 
by site visitors — only Web crawlers can read the text.
 
 Most of the time, hidden text is used to target a specific keyword that’s 
unrelated to the actual content of the site. People use this tactic to draw 
ads for higher-paying keywords because these ads are likely to pay 
better than the ads that appear based on the actual content that the visi-
tor sees.

325
 Chapter 18: Ten AdSense Don’ts
 
 The problem here is that the ads that can be influenced by hidden text 
aren’t likely to be as relevant to your site visitors, which means that 
they’re likely to get clicked less. That means a reduction in your revenue 
volume, even if the payment-per-click is higher. In the end, hidden text 
doesn’t work because it’s usually more effective to have more clicks at a 
slightly lower payout than it is to have fewer clicks at a higher payout.
 
 Having relevant ads also means that your site will be more useful to your 
visitors, making it more likely that they’ll come back in the future and 
click your ads again.
 
 Spreading malware: Malware involves applications that are created spe-
cifically for some malicious intent. These days, most malware is created 
to help the process of identity theft. It’s not at all uncommon for crimi-
nals to pay Web site owners to spread malware, even though it’s not 
exactly a nice thing to do. If you’re distributing that malware on your 
Web site, Google wants no part of your activities.
 
 Besides, spreading malware is illegal, and the pay-off could be jail time. 
Is it really worth the risk?
 
 Using false tactics: Any kind of false tactics that you might employ to 
trick users into clicking your AdSense ads is forbidden. I know, when 
you’re looking at click revenues of pennies a day, a lot of different strate-
gies look appealing — especially if they increase the amount of money 
that you’re making.
 
 Just remember, it’s only more profitable if it helps you to build a long-
term AdSense revenue stream. If not, and if it seems even the slightest 
bit out of line, don’t do it. Any risk to your good standing with AdSense 
means that you could lose whatever revenue stream you’ve legitimately 
created.

Ten Ways to Improve 
Web Site Traffic
In This Chapter
 Drawing site visitors with great content
 Taking advantage of publicity opportunities
 Marketing your Web site offline
I
mproving your Web site traffic is a tricky business. You can take advan-
tage of quite a few different strategies — many won’t cost you much 
whereas some won’t even cost you a dime. The trick is to find the right bal-
ance of strategies and then be consistent in your efforts to draw people to 
your Web site.
Consistency is also a very important factor in improving the traffic to your 
Web site. Every day you should be plugging away at your marketing efforts, 
in whatever form works best for your site. Web site marketing does require 
constant attention, however. Pushing for a short period of time to improve 
your traffic but then letting the efforts fall by the wayside does no good. 
Doing so might get you a temporary increase in traffic, but as soon as you 
stop your efforts to bring people to your site, you’ll see your traffic statistics 
begin to fall again.
What follows are some of the strategies that you can use to improve your 
Web site traffic. No single strategy works by itself, but a combination of those 
shown here — and others that you figure out on your own along the way — 
gets you moving in the right direction.
Great, Dynamic Content
Everyone seems to be seeking the key to more Web site content. In today’s 
information-driven society, great, dynamic content is the key. People are usu-
ally online because they’re looking for something — relationships, information, 
products, or services. Content is the way they find what they’re looking for.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Think about it. A decade or so ago, if you wanted to find information on any-
thing, you had to go to the library or the bookstore to find that information. 
Today, finding what you seek is as close as your computer. Just open a Web 
browser, type a few words, and what you’re looking for is sitting right in front 
of you. Very little information can’t be found online these days.
Here’s what makes one site better than another though. When I’m looking for 
information online, I click into and out of a site in the time it takes most 
people to take a sip of coffee. That’s because I know exactly what I’m looking 
for, and when I don’t see it, I move on to the next search result.
When I do find what I’m looking for, though, I tend to stick around. I’ll read 
the article that brought me to the site and then I’ll click through all the arti-
cles that are linked to it, and I might even click some of the ads shown on the 
page if they seem interesting. When I’m done, I bookmark the page to come 
back later and see what’s new.
That is what good content does for a Web site — it buys you time with your site 
visitors and it buys you return visits. If you don’t have content with that kind of 
stickiness, the first thing you can do to improve your Web site is to create that 
content. Just remember, don’t try buying it from a content broker — someone 
who commissions content from writers and then resells it to Web site or publi-
cation owners — if you really want something fresh and new because everyone 
else in your area is using the same content broker.
Referral Programs
Referral programs have a couple different sides. One side of a referral pro-
gram is the side on which you make money. That’s for putting referral but-
tons on your Web site.
What if you flip that around and create your own referral program where you 
pay visitors to share your site with others? You can do that — and should — 
if you really want to build a sizable flow of traffic to your site.
Creating a referral program isn’t too difficult. The first thing you need to do is 
determine what you can afford to invest in the program. Typically, those who 
refer your site are paid anywhere from about a penny-a-click to as much as $5 
per click or more. Some referral programs promise a flat fee for any referral 
that results in a purchase.
Your budget is the determining factor here, but remember this: The more 
you pay, the more likely others will want to refer your site to their site visi-
tors. They’re sending traffic away from their site to yours, so you must make 
it worth the referrers’ efforts.

329
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Improve Web Site Traffic
Remember that for a referral program to be effective, it should also be 
simple. If you’re telling people you’ll only pay them a referral fee if they send 
someone to your site who then makes two purchases over a 60-day period, 
unless your site is truly amazing or the products that you offer are com-
pletely unique, not too many people will refer their visitors to you. It’s just 
too hard for them to earn a reward for that referral.
A referral program also has to make it easy for referrers to be connected to 
the people that they refer. A simple form that includes a Referred By box is 
okay, but it’s only as effective as the memory of the person filling out the 
form. A link that connects referrers to your referral program so that you can 
track who they refer is much more effective for the people who are spreading 
your name around.
Setting up an easy-to-use referral program might be more difficult on your 
end, but it’s worth the investment. The less work that someone has to do to 
refer people to you and collect a reward for that referral, the more likely he’ll 
use your referral program.
Amazon.com has a referral program that’s an excellent example of what 
really works. They provide all the tools that users need to refer others to 
Amazon products. All the user has to do is plug a piece of code into her blog 
or Web site. Amazon and the visitors clicking through the referrals do the 
rest of the work.
Now, I know you don’t have the budget that Amazon has, but you should be 
able to get the technology you need without having to break the bank. A 
quick search on Google turns up referral marketing systems that are fairly 
cost effective. For example, ReferralBlast (www.referralblast.com) is an 
easy to use program that offers four different levels of referral programs — 
from a basic program to a highly customized program — that range from $99 
per year to $999 per year. Another program that’s available, and that is fairly 
easy to use, is ReferralSoftware.com (www.referralsoftware.com). This 
software — unlike ReferralBlast — allows you to set up referral programs for 
a one-time fee of $299, after which you never pay another fee.
Links and Linking Strategies
You wouldn’t think that the links on your site would make too much differ-
ence to the traffic on your site, but they do. The Web is an interconnected 
group of pages. The connection from one page to another comes in the form 
of a link. So, both on your site and from others’ sites, links are an essential 
part of drawing people in.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
One of the easiest ways to begin building a linking strategy is to contact the 
owners of Web sites that you like and ask them for a reciprocal link. Reciprocal 
links are when you put a link to that site on your page in exchange for a link 
back to your Web site. Reciprocal linking strategies are very common on 
the Web.
Another way to get people to link to you is to offer something completely 
unique on your Web site. For some, that means adding a special download 
to the site that’s not available anywhere; for others, it means adding videos, 
podcasts, or some other element that’s completely unique. Whatever your 
draw is, keep it unique and fresh. A podcast or video can be effective for a 
few days, but after a while, it loses its effectiveness and needs to be replaced 
with something new.
When you have an intricate linking strategy in place (one that leads to other 
sites of interest and back to you from other sites), you start seeing the 
results of the strategy — more traffic. The linking strategy takes a little time 
to create, but it’s well worth the effort.
Advertisements
If you haven’t already done it, check out AdWords. AdWords is the advertis-
er’s arm of AdSense. With AdWords, you can bid to show your advertise-
ments based on keywords that you select. Remember: Although AdWords 
is an advertising program, it’s not good just for products. You can use 
AdWords with your services or even content Web sites, too. The point of 
using AdWords is to advertise your site to users who might not otherwise 
find you. What you sell or provide on that site is up to you.
The cool thing about AdWords is that you can set a budget that keeps you 
from spending way more than you have available to spend on advertising 
your site.
Of course, AdWords isn’t the only game in the advertising world. You can 
also consider banner ads or even other pay-per-click advertising options. 
What’s important is that you get your Web site in front of as many people 
as possible.
Advertising probably isn’t the most effective method of getting your name 
out there — positive word of mouth and great content are your best shot — 
but if you have some cash to spend on getting your name known, it’s defi-
nitely a strategy that you should consider.

Blog Promotions
If you have a blog, you simply have to have a blog promotion (or 12). Really. 
Blogs are cool, but if you’re not out there promoting your blog every single 
day, your numbers will suck pond scum. One of the most effective types of 
blog promotion is simply to read and post on other people’s blogs. When you 
post on other people’s blogs, their readers see your post. They can click 
through any links that you have connected to your display name or within 
your comments to see your blog — in fact, you have the opportunity to 
include your blog URL when you post on most blogs, and you should always 
include it. Including your blog address gives you free exposure, just for shar-
ing your opinion.
Blogs have become so popular that even corporations now use them to 
advertise products, services, and events or just to keep readers updated on 
what’s happening with the company. The downside though is that blogs have 
become so popular that every person who even thinks they might possibly 
have something of interest to say has a blog.
Making your blog stand out from the rest of the pack is a very difficult pro-
cess. Start with a truly interesting blog — will it captivate every person on 
the Web? No. If you can make your blog fresh though, you can potentially 
gain a huge mindshare in the area in which you specialize.
After you come up with that perfect blog, you have to get the word out. Start 
by posting comments on other blogs, but don’t stop there. Spread the word 
through your friends and ask them to spread the word, too. Join mailing lists 
and make sure your blog address appears in the signature line for every post 
that you make to the list (and you do have to post to the list — preferably 
interesting, useful posts).
Consider other promotions, such as blog tours (where a blog author appears 
on several different blogs as a guest blogger), giveaways, and other contests.
Be creative, but also think in terms of what appeals to potential blog readers. 
If your blog is about a group of teens that are band groupies, a contest where 
the giveaway is a copy of War and Peace might not be the best idea. If the 
prize in your contest is a $25 iTunes card, the response could be much more 
than you even dare to hope for.
As with all types of promotions, think outside the box. Better yet, think of a 
way to create a whole new box.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Publicity and Public Relations
All too often, publicity and public relations are all lumped into the same cate-
gory of advertising. From where I sit, publicity and public relations are two 
different things. Publicity is free, and it includes coverage from other media 
sources, including newsletters, newspapers, radio stations, television, or 
whoever else may pick up word of what you’re doing.
On the Web, publicity usually takes the form of word-of-mouth type publicity. 
Someone sees your Web site and then tells someone else who happens to 
have a blog, so that person writes a blog post about it, which is then picked 
up by other bloggers, and it then catches the eye of some radio host or news-
paper journalist who then runs a brief article or makes mention of your site 
to their audience.
You get the picture — and that’s really a best-case scenario.
Did you know that you can influence publicity, too? You can — by getting the 
name of your Web site in front of as many people as possible. One way to do 
that is to write articles that are complete and ready to run, and then distrib-
ute them to news outlets, newsletter owners, other Web site owners, or 
anyone else who has a publication and might be interested in your site. The 
catch is that to run the article you provide (for free), the publication must 
also run a short blurb about you, including your Web site address.
That takes care of publicity. Public relations, on the other hand, deals with 
how you handle people, especially in a public setting. You can put that to 
work for your Web site, too. Public relations can be the donations that you 
make (in the name of your Web site) to charity organizations, or it can be you 
taking the time to teach about your topic within your community. Guess 
what? Just putting your knowledge to use by answering questions posed by 
folks in search of answers can count as public relations.
Creating a relationship with the public is what public relations is all about. 
When you use public relations — along with publicity — to get your Web site 
in front of people, you’re building your traffic levels (which in turn helps 
build your AdSense revenues). Creating public relations and publicity is a 
time-consuming process, though, so don’t make the mistake of thinking that 
you can spend ten minutes here and there and immediately see results.
Professionals set aside several hours each week to devote to public relations 
and publicity efforts. You should do the same if you’re truly serious about 
creating a real brand with your Web site that people will think of and recog-
nize when they consider topics related to your site and products. (Creating a 
brand simply means making your Web site or blog immediately recognizable, 
just like other products [Pepsi, Kleenex, Saran Wrap] are immediately recog-
nizable. The goal is to be the first site or blog that comes to mind when your 
topic or product is considered.)

333
 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Improve Web Site Traffic
Lead Generation and Follow-Up
One thing that Web site owners don’t often think of in terms of driving traffic 
to their sites is lead generation. Lead generation in this context is nothing 
more than the process by which you gather the names and e-mail addresses 
of people who may be interested in your Web site or blog — these are all 
potential visitors. And following up on those leads is how you convert those 
potential visitors into actual visitors. Lead generation takes place in several 
different ways. For some sites, it’s a newsletter sign-up, but for others, it’s a 
contest or promotion that you e-mail to a mailing list you purchased from a 
marketing company.
How can generating leads help you build traffic on your site? It’s easy, really. 
If you’re collecting leads, you can keep your site in front of potential visitors 
more often.
That does require follow-up, though. Although some Web site owners are 
great at collecting leads, they don’t do much with them — you should. If you 
have a collection of people who have willingly given you their e-mail address, 
you should be using that address as often as you can to keep in touch with 
those potential visitors.
Many Web site owners do collect e-mail addresses (which in this case are 
your leads). Having folks sign up for a newsletter is one of the most popular 
harvesting methods out there. You can also collect the e-mail addresses of 
visitors when they register for your site or when they purchase goods or 
services from you.
However you collect the addresses, they’re no good to you if they just sit on 
a list doing nothing. After you have your e-mail addresses, use them to put 
your name in front of those people — and the more helpful you can be in the 
process, the better it is for your Web site.
Here’s an example: One Web site owner collects people’s e-mail addresses 
for a newsletter. The newsletter goes out without fail (consistency is key 
with newsletters) every two weeks. That same Web site owner also sends 
out a message about once a month that contains tips that the readers can 
use immediately to improve their business.
This type of extra information — service above and beyond the call of duty — 
is what helps build traffic for the Web site. When potential visitors turn to the 
area that the site addresses, that site is of course the first site to come to mind 
because the Web site owner has kept the site’s name in front of them as often 
as possible.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Keep in mind this fact though: It’s absolutely essential that the communica-
tions you have with your potential visitors be useful. Sales, extra information, 
even contest announcements are useful. Just sending a note to say hello? 
Nothing useful about that at all, and users won’t appreciate it.
The idea is to create a feeling of appreciation so that you’re first in the visi-
tor’s mind when she thinks of the area that you serve. Being first means more 
Web site traffic for you.
Contests
I briefly mention contests a little earlier in this chapter. I bring them up here 
because contests are a great way to bring traffic to your Web site. Everyone 
loves a good contest, especially when the prizes are neat.
Deciding what the prizes are for your contest is very important. Think of 
what appeals to people who would be interested in your site. I mention ear-
lier in the chapter that if your site’s about music, giving away copies of War 
and Peace just won’t cut it because such a contest wouldn’t target the spe-
cific people that you want to see your site.
When you’re considering the prizes that you should give away, consider what 
type of prize would draw the kind of person that would be interested in your 
site. If the purpose of the contest is to draw visitors to your site, the wrong 
prizes won’t help you at all.
Devising the type of contest to have is the next step. What is it people need 
to do to get the prize? One thing that many Web site owners do is require 
that users register for a newsletter, and then the winner is drawn from those 
who signed up for the newsletter. Bloggers often run contests where visitors 
are required to leave a comment on the blog.
After you create your contest, all you have to do is get the word out. 
Announce the contest on your Web site, blog, and any mailing lists that you 
have. Tell your friends and ask them to tell their friends. If the contest’s 
good, word gets around quickly.
You’ll see a spike in the amount of traffic that you have to your site during 
the contest period, but if you conduct it right, an overall increase will remain 
after the contest is over. Take the time to design your contest to meet the 
specific goal of creating traffic (especially return traffic) to your site, and 
you’ll see the benefits of this strategy the first time you try it.

 Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Improve Web Site Traffic
Social Media Marketing
Social marketing is a relatively new concept that’s based on a phenomenon 
that’s grown despite the fact that no marketing experts saw it coming, and 
it’s all based on social networks, such as those brought into being by 
MySpace and Facebook.
The idea with social networks is that you have an online community where 
you can connect and share with people who have the same interests that you 
do. For some, that might be an interest in specific people or hobbies. For 
others, the interest could surround employment or education. What’s impor-
tant is that a social network lets you create a circle of like-minded friends and 
acquaintances — also called a community. For example, with MySpace, the 
concept is to build a home page where you and your friends can connect. 
You can also connect with others who are potential friends because they can 
view your MySpace page and learn about you and your interests.
If you’re marketing with social networking, create your network, and as you have 
something to market, share it with that group of friends in your community. 
They then share it with their friends, and before you know it, a network that’s 
far beyond the group you could reach on your own knows what you’re doing.
Here’s the catch with social media marketing though: If you develop a social 
network specifically to sell something to the people in that network, you’ll fall 
right on your face. Really. Social networks are created by people who have 
something to share with other people who think like them. If you barge into the 
network with a sales pitch and nothing more, you’ll be completely ostracized.
To be truly effective, you have to actually participate in the communities that 
you join. That means interacting with people and offering up something that 
others can use most of the time without expecting anything in return.
If you really want to see how social media marketing works, check out some 
of the organizations that have successful sites on MySpace or Facebook — 
Christian bands like Three Days Grace, for example. To get to the point 
where a social media marketing strategy is successful requires a lot of effort 
and attention, but the results can be very much worth the time you put into 
developing your place on the network.
Offline Marketing Strategies
Offline marketing strategies are probably the last type of marketing you’d 
expect me to address when it comes to Web sites, but sometimes the offline 
strategies can really work — it does depend on how you go about it, though.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Offline marketing strategies can be anything from press releases to T-shirts 
to direct mailings. Think about all the commercials that you see during the 
Super Bowl. How many of those commercials had Web site addresses 
attached to them? Did you know that those companies paid millions of dol-
lars to have those commercials shown?
You may not be in a position to pay millions of dollars to have your Web 
address plastered all over the television, but that doesn’t mean you should 
avoid offline advertising methods. Some of the things that you can do on a 
very small budget include putting magnetic signs on the side of your car, 
wearing T-shirts with your Web address on them, doing radio interviews, 
sending out press releases, sponsoring a little-league sports team, and the 
list goes on nearly forever.
The trick with making offline advertising work is to make sure that you’re not 
investing too much into it, and that it appears in front of the widest audience 
possible. I wouldn’t suggest that you spend thousands of dollars on offline 
advertisements, but spending a few hundred here and there could increase 
your traffic in small, but valuable increments.
Ultimately, the best way to draw more traffic to your Web site isn’t a single 
way but is more a combination of all the ways listed here. You have to work 
to find the right balance of what works, but with enough time and effort, you 
can get the word out there and draw in visitors.
