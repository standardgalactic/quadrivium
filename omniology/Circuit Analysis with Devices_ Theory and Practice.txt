A
n electrical circuit is a system of interconnected components such as resis-
tors, capacitors, inductors, voltage sources, and so on. The electrical behav-
ior of these components is described by a few basic experimental laws. These
laws and the principles, concepts, mathematical relationships, and methods of
analysis that have evolved from them are known as circuit theory.
Much of circuit theory deals with problem solving and numerical analysis.
When you analyze a problem or design a circuit, for example, you are typically
required to compute values for voltage, current, and power. In addition to a
numerical value, your answer must include a unit. The system of units used for
this purpose is the SI system (Systéme International). The SI system is a unified
system of metric measurement; it encompasses not only the familiar MKS
(meters, kilograms, seconds) units for length, mass, and time, but also units for
electrical and magnetic quantities as well.
Quite frequently, however, the SI units yield numbers that are either too
large or too small for convenient use. To handle these, engineering notation and
a set of standard prefixes have been developed. Their use in representation and
computation is described and illustrated. The question of significant digits is also
investigated.
Since circuit theory is somewhat abstract, diagrams are used to help present
ideas. We look at several types—schematic, pictorial, and block diagrams—and
show how to use them to represent circuits and systems.
We conclude the chapter with a brief look at computer usage in circuit analy-
sis and design. Several popular application packages and programming languages
are described. Special emphasis is placed on OrCAD PSpice and Electronics
Workbench, the two principal software packages used throughout this book.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
Hints on Problem Solving
DURING THEANALYSIS of electric circuits, you will find yourself solving quite a few
problems.An organized approach helps. Listed belowaresome useful guidelines:
1. Make a sketch (e.g., a circuit diagram), mark on it what you know, then iden-
tify what it is that you are trying to determine. Watch for “implied data” such
as the phrase “the capacitor is initially uncharged”. (As you will find out
later, this means that the initial voltage on the capacitor is zero.) Be sure to
convert all implied data to explicit data.
2. Think through the problem to identify the principles involved, then look for
relationships that tie together the unknown and known quantities.
3. Substitute the known information into the selected equation(s) and solve for
the unknown. (For complex problems, the solution may require a series of
steps involving several concepts. If you cannot identify the complete set of
steps before you start, start anyway. As each piece of the solution emerges, you
are one step closer to the answer. You may make false starts. However, even
experienced people do not get it right on the first try every time. Note also that
there is seldom one “right” way to solve a problem. You may therefore come
up with an entirely different correct solution method than the authors do.)
4. Check the answer to see that it is sensible—that is, is it in the “right ball-
park”? Does it have the correct sign? Do the units match?

Introduction
Technology is rapidly changing the way we do things; we now have comput-
ers in our homes, electronic control systems in our cars, cellular phones that
can be used just about anywhere, robots that assemble products on produc-
tion lines, and so on.
A first step to understanding these technologies is electric circuit theory.
Circuit theory provides you with the knowledge of basic principles that you
need to understand the behavior of electric and electronic devices, circuits,
and systems. In this book, we develop and explore its basic ideas.
Before We Begin
Before we begin, let us look at a few examples of the technology at work.
(As you go through these, you will see devices, components, and ideas that
have not yet been discussed.You will learn about these later. For the moment,
just concentrate on the general ideas.)
As a first example, consider Figure 1–1, which shows a VCR. Its design
is based on electrical, electronic, and magnetic circuit principles. For exam-
ple, resistors, capacitors, transistors, and integrated circuits are used to con-
trol the voltages and currents that operate its motors and amplify the audio
and video signals that are the heart of the system. A magnetic circuit (the
read/write system) performs the actual tape reads and writes. It creates,
shapes, and controls the magnetic field that records audio and video signals
on the tape. Another magnetic circuit, the power transformer, transforms the
ac voltage from the 120-volt wall outlet voltage to the lower voltages required
by the system.

Chapter 1 I Introduction
FIGURE 1–1
A VCR is a familiar example of an electrical/electronic system.

Figure 1–2 shows another example. In this case, a designer, using a per-
sonal computer, is analyzing the performance of a power transformer. The
transformer must meet not only the voltage and current requirements of the
application, but safety- and efficiency-related concerns as well. A software
application package, programmed with basic electrical and magnetic circuit
fundamentals, helps the user perform this task.
Figure 1–3 shows another application, a manufacturing facility where
fine pitch surface-mount (SMT) components are placed on printed circuit
boards at high speed using laser centering and optical verification. The bot-
tom row of Figure 1–4 shows how small these components are. Computer
control provides the high precision needed to accurately position parts as
tiny as these.
Before We Move On
Before we move on, we should note that, as diverse as these applications are,
they all have one thing in common: all are rooted in the principles of circuit
theory.

The SI System of Units
The solution of technical problems requires the use of units. At present, two
major systems—the English (US Customary) and the metric—are in everyday
use. For scientific and technical purposes, however, the English system has
been largely superseded. In its place the SI system is used. Table 1–1 shows a
few frequently encountered quantities with units expressed in both systems.
The SI system combines the MKS metric units and the electrical units
into one unified system: See Tables 1–2 and 1–3. (Do not worry about the
electrical units yet. We define them later, starting in Chapter 2.) The units in
Table 1–2 are defined units, while the units in Table 1–3 are derived units,
obtained by combining units from Table 1–2. Note that some symbols and
abbreviations use capital letters while others use lowercase letters.
A few non-SI units are still in use. For example, electric motors are
commonly rated in horsepower, and wires are frequently specified in AWG
sizes (American Wire Gage, Section 3.2). On occasion, you will need to con-
vert non-SI units to SI units. Table 1–4 may be used for this purpose.
Definition of Units
When the metric system came into being in 1792, the meter was defined as
one ten-millionth of the distance from the north pole to the equator and the
second as 1/60  1/60  1/24 of the mean solar day. Later, more accurate def-
initions based on physical laws of nature were adopted. The meter is now

defined as the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a
second, while the second is defined in terms of the period of a cesium-based
atomic clock. The definition of the kilogram is the mass of a specific plat-
inum-iridium cylinder (the international prototype), preserved at the Interna-
tional Bureau of Weights and Measures in France.
Relative Size of the Units*
To gain a feel for the SI units and their relative size, refer to Tables 1–1 and
1–4. Note that 1 meter is equal to 39.37 inches; thus, 1 inch equals 1/39.37 
0.0254 meter or 2.54 centimeters. A force of one pound is equal to 4.448
newtons; thus, 1 newton is equal to 1/4.448  0.225 pound of force, which
is about the force required to lift a 1⁄4-pound weight. One joule is the work
done in moving a distance of one meter against a force of one newton. This
is about equal to the work required to raise a quarter-pound weight one
meter. Raising the weight one meter in one second requires about one watt
of power.
The watt is also the SI unit for electrical power. A typical electric lamp,
for example, dissipates power at the rate of 60 watts, and a toaster at a rate of
about 1000 watts.
The link between electrical and mechanical units can be easily estab-
lished. Consider an electrical generator. Mechanical power input produces
electrical power output. If the generator were 100% efficient, then one watt
of mechanical power input would yield one watt of electrical power output.
This clearly ties the electrical and mechanical systems of units together.
However, just how big is a watt? While the above examples suggest that
the watt is quite small, in terms of the rate at which a human can work it is
actually quite large. For example, a person can do manual labor at a rate of
about 60 watts when averaged over an 8-hour day—just enough to power a
standard 60-watt electric lamp continuously over this time! A horse can do
considerably better. Based on experiment, Isaac Watt determined that a strong
dray horse could average 746 watts. From this, he defined the horsepower (hp)
as 1 horsepower  746 watts. This is the figure that we still use today.

Converting Units
Often quantities expressed in one unit must be converted to another. For
example, suppose you want to determine how many kilometers there are in
ten miles. Given that 1 mile is equal to 1.609 kilometers, Table 1–1, you can
write 1 mi  1.609 km, using the abbreviations in Table 1–4. Now multiply
both sides by 10. Thus, 10 mi  16.09 km.
This procedure is quite adequate for simple conversions. However, for
complex conversions, it may be difficult to keep track of units. The proce-
dure outlined next helps. It involves writing units into the conversion
sequence, cancelling where applicable, then gathering up the remaining units
to ensure that the final result has the correct units.
To get at the idea, suppose you want to convert 12 centimeters to
inches. From Table 1–1, 2.54 cm  1 in. Since these are equivalent, you can
write

2.5
1
4
in
cm
  1
or 
2.5
1
4
in
cm
  1
(1–1)
Now multiply 12 cm by the second ratio and note that unwanted units can-
cel. Thus,
12 cm  
2.5
1
4
in
cm
  4.72 in
The quantities in equation 1–1 are called conversion factors. Conver-
sion factors have a value of 1 and you can multiply by them without chang-
ing the value of an expression. When you have a chain of conversions, select
factors so that all unwanted units cancel. This provides an automatic check
on the final result as illustrated in part (b) of Example 1–1.

You can also solve this problem by treating the numerator and denomi-
nator separately. For example, you can convert miles to meters and hours to
seconds, then divide (see Example 1–2). In the final analysis, both methods
are equivalent.

Power of Ten Notation
Electrical values vary tremendously in size. In electronic systems, for example,
voltages may range from a few millionths of a volt to several thousand volts,
while in power systems, voltages of up to several hundred thousand are com-
mon.Tohandle thislargerange, thepower of tennotation (Table 1–5)is used.
To express a number in power of ten notation, move the decimal point to
where you want it, then multiply the result by the power of ten needed to
restore the number to its original value. Thus, 247 000  2.47  105. (The
number 10 is called the base, and its power is called the exponent.) An easy
way to determine the exponent is to count the number of places (right or left)
that you moved the decimal point. Thus,
247 000  2 4 7 0 0 0  2.47  105
5 4 3 2 1

Similarly, the number 0.003 69 may be expressed as 3.69  103 as illus-
trated below.
0.003 69  0.0 0 3 6 9  3.69  103

Multiplication and Division Using Powers of Ten
To multiply numbers in power of ten notation, multiply their base numbers,
then add their exponents. Thus,
(1.2  103)(1.5  104)  (1.2)(1.5)  10(34)  1.8  107
For division, subtract the exponents in the denominator from those in the
numerator. Thus,

Addition and Subtraction Using Powers of Ten
To add or subtract, first adjust all numbers to the same power of ten. It does
not matter what exponent you choose, as long as all are the same.

Powers
Raising a number to a power is a form of multiplication (or division if the
exponent is negative). For example,
(2  103)2  (2  103)(2  103)  4  106
In general, (N  10n)m  Nm  10nm. In this notation, (2  103)2  22 
1032  4  106 as before.
Integer fractional powers represent roots. Thus, 41/2  4  2 and
271/3  
3 27  3.

b. 3.25  102  0.325  103. Thus, 0.325  103  5  103  5.325  103,
which is the same as 53.25  102
Use common sense when han-
dling numbers. With calculators,
for example, it is often easier to
work directly with numbers in
their original form than to con-
vert them to power of ten nota-
tion. (As an example, it is more
sensible to multiply 276 
0.009 directly than to convert to
power of ten notation as we did
in Example 1–3(a).) If the final
result is needed as a power of
ten, you can convert as a last
step.

Prefixes
Scientific and Engineering Notation
If power of ten numbers are written with one digit to the left of the decimal
place, they are said to be in scientific notation. Thus, 2.47  105 is in sci-
entific notation, while 24.7  104 and 0.247  106 are not. However, we
are more interested in engineering notation. In engineering notation, pre-
fixes are used to represent certain powers of ten; see Table 1–6. Thus, a
quantity such as 0.045 A (amperes) can be expressed as 45  103 A, but it
is preferable to express it as 45 mA. Here, we have substituted the prefix
milli for the multiplier 103. It is usual to select a prefix that results in a
base number between 0.1 and 999. Thus, 1.5  105 s would be expressed
as 15 ms.

Solution
0.1 MV  0.1  106 V  (0.1  103)  103 V  100 kV
Remember that a prefix represents a power of ten and thus the rules for
power of ten computation apply. For example, when adding or subtracting,
adjust to a common base, as illustrated in Example 1–8.
EXAMPLE 1–8
Compute the sum of 1 ampere (amp) and 100 milli-
amperes.
Solution
Adjust to a common base, either amps (A) or milliamps (mA).
Thus,
1 A  100 mA  1 A  100  103 A  1 A  0.1 A  1.1 A
Alternatively, 1 A  100 mA  1000 mA  100 mA  1100 mA.

1.6
Significant Digits and Numerical Accuracy
The number of digits in a number that carry actual information are termed
significant digits. Thus, if we say a piece of wire is 3.57 meters long, we
mean that its length is closer to 3.57 m than it is to 3.56 m or 3.58 m and we
have three significant digits. (The number of significant digits includes the
first estimated digit.) If we say that it is 3.570 m, we mean that it is closer to

When determining significant digits, zeros used to locate the decimal point
are not counted. Thus, 0.004 57 has three significant digits; this can be seen
if you express it as 4.57  103.

Section 1.6 I Significant Digits and Numerical Accuracy
15
When working with numbers,
you will encounter exact num-
bers and approximate numbers.
Exact numbers are numbers that
we know for certain, while
approximate numbers are num-
bers that have some uncertainty.
For example, when we say that
there are 60 minutes in one hour,
the 60 here is exact. However, if
we measure the length of a wire
and state it as 60 m, the 60 in
this case carries some uncer-
tainty (depending on how good
our measurement is), and is thus
an approximate number. When
an exact number is included in a
calculation, there is no limit to
how many decimal places you
can associate with it—the accu-
racy of the result is affected only
by the approximate numbers
involved in the calculation.
Many numbers encountered in
technical work are approximate,
as they have been obtained by
measurement.
NOTES...
In this book, given numbers are
assumed to be exact unless oth-
erwise noted. Thus, when a
value is given as 3 volts, take it
to mean exactly 3 volts, not sim-
ply that it has one significant
figure. Since our numbers are
assumed to be exact, all digits
are significant, and we use as
many digits as are convenient in
examples and problems. Final
answers are usually rounded to 3
digits.
NOTES...
Most calculations that you will do in circuit theory will be done using a
hand calculator. An error that has become quite common is to show more
digits of “accuracy” in an answer than are warranted, simply because the
numbers appear on the calculator display. The number of digits that you
should show is related to the number of significant digits in the numbers
used in the calculation.
To illustrate, suppose you have two numbers, A  3.76 and B  3.7, to
be multiplied. Their product is 13.912. If the numbers 3.76 and 3.7 are exact
this answer is correct. However, if the numbers have been obtained by mea-
surement where values cannot be determined exactly, they will have some
uncertainty and the product must reflect this uncertainty. For example, sup-
pose A and B have an uncertainty of 1 in their first estimated digit—that is,
A  3.76  0.01 and B  3.7  0.1. This means that A can be as small as
3.75 or as large as 3.77, while B can be as small as 3.6 or as large as 3.8.
Thus, their product can be as small as 3.75  3.6  13.50 or as large as
3.77  3.8  14.326. The best that we can say about the product is that it is
14, i.e., that you know it only to the nearest whole number. You cannot even
say that it is 14.0 since this implies that you know the answer to the nearest
tenth, which, as you can see from the above, you do not.
We can now give a “rule of thumb” for determining significant digits.
The number of significant digits in a result due to multiplication or division
is the same as the number of significant digits in the number with the least
number of significant digits. In the previous calculation, for example, 3.7 has
two significant digits so that the answer can have only two significant digits
as well. This agrees with our earlier observation that the answer is 14, not
14.0 (which has three).
When adding or subtracting, you must also use common sense. For
example, suppose two currents are measured as 24.7 A (one place known
after the decimal point) and 123 mA (i.e., 0.123 A). Their sum is 24.823 A.
However, the right-hand digits 23 in the answer are not significant. They
cannot be, since, if you don’t know what the second digit after the decimal
point is for the first current, it is senseless to claim that you know their sum
to the third decimal place! The best that you can say about the sum is that it
also has one significant digit after the decimal place, that is,
24.7
A
(One place after decimal)
 0.123 A
24.823 A →24.8 A (One place after decimal)
Therefore, when adding numbers, add the given data, then round the result to
the last column where all given numbers have significant digits. The process
is similar for subtraction.

1.7
Circuit Diagrams
Electric circuits are constructed using components such as batteries, switches,
resistors, capacitors, transistors, interconnecting wires, etc. To represent these
circuits on paper, diagrams are used. In this book, we use three types: block
diagrams, schematic diagrams, and pictorials.
Block Diagrams
Block diagrams describe a circuit or system in simplified form. The overall
problem is broken into blocks, each representing a portion of the system or
circuit. Blocks are labelled to indicate what they do or what they contain,
then interconnected to show their relationship to each other. General signal
flow is usually from left to right and top to bottom. Figure 1–5, for example,
represents an audio amplifier. Although you have not covered any of its cir-
cuits yet, you should be able to follow the general idea quite easily—sound
is picked up by the microphone, converted to an electrical signal, amplified
by a pair of amplifiers, then output to the speaker, where it is converted back
to sound. A power supply energizes the system. The advantage of a block
diagram is that it gives you the overall picture and helps you understand the
general nature of a problem. However, it does not provide detail.

audio amplification system.

Pictorial Diagrams
Pictorial diagrams are one of the types of diagrams that provide detail.
They help you visualize circuits and their operation by showing components
as they actually appear. For example, the circuit of Figure 1–6 consists of a
battery, a switch, and an electric lamp, all interconnected by wire. Operation
is easy to visualize—when the switch is closed, the battery causes current in
the circuit, which lights the lamp. The battery is referred to as the source and
the lamp as the load.
Schematic Diagrams
While pictorial diagrams help you visualize circuits, they are cumbersome to
draw. Schematic diagrams get around this by using simplified, standard
symbols to represent components; see Table 1–7. (The meaning of these
symbols will be made clear as you progress through the book.) In Figure
1–7(a), for example, we have used some of these symbols to create a
schematic for the circuit of Figure 1–6. Each component has been replaced
by its corresponding circuit symbol.
When choosing symbols, choose those that are appropriate to the occa-
sion. Consider the lamp of Figure 1–7(a). As we will show later, the lamp
possesses a property called resistance that causes it to resist the passage of
charge. When you wish to emphasize this property, use the resistance symbol
rather than the lamp symbol, as in Figure 1–7(b).

When you draw schematic diagrams, draw them with horizontal and ver-
tical lines joined at right angles as in Figure 1–7. This is standard practice.
(At this point you should glance through some later chapters, e.g., Chapter 7,
and study additional examples.)
1.8
Circuit Analysis Using Computers
Personal computers are used extensively for analysis and design. Software
tools available for such tasks fall into two broad categories: prepackaged
application programs (application packages) and programming languages.
Application packages solve problems without requiring programming on
the part of the user, while programming languages require the user to write
code for each type of problem to be solved.
Circuit Simulation Software
Simulation software is application software; it solves problems by simulating
the behavior of electrical and electronic circuits rather than by solving sets of
equations. To analyze a circuit, you “build” it on your screen by selecting
components (resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.) from a library of parts,
which you then position and interconnect to form the desired circuit. You can

the click of a mouse. Figures 1–8 and 1–9 show two examples.
Most simulation packages use a software engine called SPICE, an acro-
nym for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis. Popular
products are PSpice, Electronics Workbench® (EWB) and Circuit Maker. In
this text, we use Electronics Workbench and OrCAD PSpice, both of which
have either evaluation or student versions (see the Preface for more details).
Both products have their strong points. Electronics Workbench, for instance,
more closely models an actual workbench (complete with realistic meters)
than does PSpice and is a bit easier to learn. On the other hand, PSpice has a

more complete analysis capability; for example, it determines and displays
important information (such as phase angles in ac analyses and current
waveforms in transient analysis) that Electronics Workbench, as of this writ-
ing, does not.
Prepackaged Math Software
Math packages also require no programming. A popular product is Mathcad
from Mathsoft Inc. With Mathcad, you enter equations in standard mathe-
matical notation. For example, to find the first root of a quadratic equation,
you would use
x: 
Mathcad is a great aid for solving simultaneous equations such as those
encountered during mesh or nodal analysis (Chapters 8 and 19) and for plot-
ting waveforms. (You simply enter the formula.) In addition, Mathcad incor-
porates a built-in Electronic Handbook that contains hundreds of useful for-
mulas and circuit diagrams that can save you a great deal of time.
Programming Languages
Many problems can also be solved using programming languages such as
BASIC, C, or FORTRAN. To solve a problem using a programming lan-
guage, you code its solution, step by step. We do not consider programming
languages in this book.
A Word of Caution
With the widespread availability of inexpensive software tools, you may
wonder why you are asked to solve problems manually throughout this book.
The reason is that, as a student, your job is to learn principles and concepts.
Getting correct answers using prepackaged software does not necessarily
mean that you understand the theory—it may mean only that you know how
to enter data. Software tools should always be used wisely. Before you use
PSpice, Electronics Workbench, or any other application package, be sure
that you understand the basics of the subject that you are studying. This is
why you should solve problems manually with your calculator first. Follow-
ing this, try some of the application packages to explore ideas. Most chapters
(starting with Chapter 4) include a selection of worked-out examples and
problems to get you started.

A
basic electric circuit consisting of a source of electrical energy, a switch, a
load, and interconnecting wire is shown in Figure 2–1. When the switch is
closed, current in the circuit causes the light to come on. This circuit is represen-
tative of many common circuits found in practice, including those of flashlights
and automobile headlight systems. We will use it to help develop an understand-
ing of voltage and current.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
Elementary atomic theory shows that the current in Figure 2–1 is actually a
flow of charges. The cause of their movement is the “voltage” of the source.
While in Figure 2–1 this source is a battery, in practice it may be any one of a
number of practical sources including generators, power supplies, solar cells, and
so on.
In this chapter we look at the basic ideas of voltage and current. We begin
with a discussion of atomic theory. This leads us to free electrons and the idea of
current as a movement of charge. The fundamental definitions of voltage and
current are then developed. Following this, we look at a number of common volt-
age sources. The chapter concludes with a discussion of voltmeters and amme-
ters and the measurement of voltage and current in practice.

Atomic Theory Review
The basic structure of an atom is shown symbolically in Figure 2–2. It con-
sists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a group of orbiting
electrons. As you learned in physics, the electrons are negatively charged
(), while the protons are positively charged (). Each atom (in its normal
state) has an equal number of electrons and protons, and since their charges
are equal and opposite, they cancel, leaving the atom electrically neutral, i.e.,
with zero net charge. The nucleus, however, has a net positive charge, since
it consists of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons.

Chapter 2 I Voltage and Current
The Equations of Circuit Theory
IN THIS CHAPTER you meet the first of the equations and formulas that we use
to describe the relationships of circuit theory. Remembering formulas is made
easier if you clearly understand the principles and concepts on which they are
based. As you may recall from high school physics, formulas can come about
in only one of three ways, through experiment, by definition, or by mathemati-
cal manipulation.
Experimental Formulas
Circuit theory rests on a few basic experimental results. These are results that
can be proven in no other way; they are valid solely because experiment has
shown them to be true. The most fundamental of these are called “laws.” Four
examples are Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s current law, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, and
Faraday’s law. (These laws will be met in various chapters throughout the
book.) When you see a formula referred to as a law or an experimental result,
remember that it is based on experiment and cannot be obtained in any other
way.
Defined Formulas
Some formulas are created by definition, i.e., we make them up. For example,
there are 60 seconds in a minute because we define the second as 1/60 of a
minute. From this we get the formula tsec  60  tmin.
Derived Formulas
This type of formula or equation is created mathematically by combining or
manipulating other formulas. In contrast to the other two types of formulas, the
only way that a derived relationship can be obtained is by mathematics.
An awareness of where circuit theory formulas come from is important to
you. This awareness not only helps you understand and remember formulas, it
helps you understand the very foundations of the theory—the basic experimen-
tal premises upon which it rests, the important definitions that have been made,
and the methods by which these foundation ideas have been put together. This
can help enormously in understanding and remembering concepts.

FIGURE 2–2
Bohr model of the atom. Electrons travel around the nucleus at incredible
speeds, making billions of trips in a fraction of a second. The force of attraction between
the electrons and the protons in the nucleus keeps them in orbit.
The basic structure of Figure 2–2 applies to all elements, but each ele-
ment has its own unique combination of electrons, protons, and neutrons.
For example, the hydrogen atom, the simplest of all atoms, has one proton
and one electron, while the copper atom has 29 electrons, 29 protons, and 35
neutrons. Silicon, which is important because of its use in transistors and
other electronic devices, has 14 electrons, 14 protons, and 14 neutrons.
Electrons orbit the nucleus in spherical orbits called shells, designated
by letters K, L, M, N, and so on (Figure 2–3). Only certain numbers of elec-
trons can exist within any given shell. For example, there can be up to 2
electrons in the K shell, up to 8 in the L shell, up to 18 in the M shell, and up
to 32 in the N shell. The number in any shell depends on the element. For
instance, the copper atom, which has 29 electrons, has all three of its inner
shells completely filled but its outer shell (shell N) has only 1 electron, Fig-
ure 2–4. This outermost shell is called its valence shell, and the electron in it
is called its valence electron.
No element can have more than eight valence electrons; when a valence
shell has eight electrons, it is filled. As we shall see, the number of valence
electrons that an element has directly affects its electrical properties.

Electrical Charge
In the previous paragraphs, we mentioned the word “charge”. However, we
need to look at its meaning in more detail. First, we should note that electri-
cal charge is an intrinsic property of matter that manifests itself in the form
of forces—electrons repel other electrons but attract protons, while protons
repel each other but attract electrons. It was through studying these forces
that scientists determined that the charge on the electron is negative while
that on the proton is positive.
However, the way in which we use the term “charge” extends beyond
this. To illustrate, consider again the basic atom of Figure 2–2. It has equal
numbers of electrons and protons, and since their charges are equal and
opposite, they cancel, leaving the atom as a whole uncharged. However, if
the atom acquires additional electrons (leaving it with more electrons than
protons), we say that it (the atom) is negatively charged; conversely, if it
loses electrons and is left with fewer electrons than protons, we say that it is
positively charged. The term “charge” in this sense denotes an imbalance
between the number of electrons and protons present in the atom.
Now move up to the macroscopic level. Here, substances in their normal
state are also generally uncharged; that is, they have equal numbers of elec-
trons and protons. However, this balance is easily disturbed—electrons can
be stripped from their parent atoms by simple actions such as walking across
a carpet, sliding off a chair, or spinning clothes in a dryer. (Recall “static
cling”.) Consider two additional examples from physics. Suppose you rub an
ebonite (hard rubber) rod with fur. This action causes a transfer of electrons
from the fur to the rod. The rod therefore acquires an excess of electrons and
is thus negatively charged. Similarly, when a glass rod is rubbed with silk,
electrons are transferred from the glass rod to the silk, leaving the rod with a
deficiency and, consequently, a positive charge. Here again, charge refers to
an imbalance of electrons and protons.
As the above examples illustrate, “charge” can refer to the charge on an
individual electron or to the charge associated with a whole group of elec-
trons. In either case, this charge is denoted by the letter Q, and its unit of mea-
surement in the SI system is the coulomb. (The definition of the coulomb is
considered shortly.) In general, the charge Q associated with a group of elec-
trons is equal to the product of the number of electrons times the charge on
each individual electron. Since charge manifests itself in the form of forces,
charge is defined in terms of these forces. This is discussed next.

Coulomb’s Law
The force between charges was studied by the French scientist Charles
Coulomb (1736–1806). Coulomb determined experimentally that the force
between two charges Q1 and Q2 (Figure 2–5) is directly proportional to the
product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the dis-
tance between them. Mathematically, Coulomb’s law states


[newtons, N]
(2–1)
where Q1 and Q2 are the charges in coulombs, r is the center-to-center spac-
ing between them in meters, and k  9  109. Coulomb’s law applies to
aggregates of charges as in Figure 2–5(a) and (b), as well as to individual
electrons within the atom as in (c).
As Coulomb’s law indicates, force decreases inversely as the square of
distance; thus, if the distance between two charges is doubled, the force
decreases to (1⁄2)2  1⁄4 (i.e., one quarter) of its original value. Because of
this relationship, electrons in outer orbits are less strongly attracted to the
nucleus than those in inner orbits; that is, they are less tightly bound to the
nucleus than those close by. Valence electrons are the least tightly bound and
will, if they acquire sufficient energy, escape from their parent atoms.
Free Electrons
The amount of energy required to escape depends on the number of electrons
in the valence shell. If an atom has only a few valence electrons, only a small
amount of additional energy is needed. For example, for a metal like copper,
valence electrons can gain sufficient energy from heat alone (thermal energy),
even at room temperature, to escape from their parent atoms and wander from
atom to atom throughout the material as depicted in Figure 2–6. (Note that
these electrons do not leave the substance, they simply wander from the
valence shell of one atom to the valence shell of another. The material there-
fore remains electrically neutral.) Such electrons are called free electrons. In
copper, there are of the order of 1023 free electrons per cubic centimeter at
room temperature. As we shall see, it is the presence of this large number of
free electrons that makes copper such a good conductor of electric current. On
the other hand, if the valence shell is full (or nearly full), valence electrons are
much more tightly bound. Such materials have few (if any) free electrons.
Ions
As noted earlier, when a previously neutral atom gains or loses an electron, it
acquires a net electrical charge. The charged atom is referred to as an ion. If
the atom loses an electron, it is called a positive ion; if it gains an electron, it
is called a negative ion.
Conductors, Insulators, and Semiconductors
The atomic structure of matter affects how easily charges, i.e., electrons,
move through a substance and hence how it is used electrically. Electrically,
materials are classified as conductors, insulators, or semiconductors.

Conductors
Materials through which charges move easily are termed conductors. The
most familiar examples are metals. Good metal conductors have large num-
bers of free electrons that are able to move about easily. In particular, silver,
copper, gold, and aluminum are excellent conductors. Of these, copper is the
most widely used. Not only is it an excellent conductor, it is inexpensive and
easily formed into wire, making it suitable for a broad spectrum of applica-
tions ranging from common house wiring to sophisticated electronic equip-
ment. Aluminum, although it is only about 60% as good a conductor as cop-
per, is also used, mainly in applications where light weight is important,
such as in overhead power transmission lines. Silver and gold are too expen-
sive for general use. However, gold, because it oxidizes less than other mate-
rials, is used in specialized applications; for example, some critical electrical
connectors use it because it makes a more reliable connection than other
materials.
Insulators
Materials that do not conduct (e.g., glass, porcelain, plastic, rubber, and so
on) are termed insulators. The covering on electric lamp cords, for example,
is an insulator. It is used to prevent the wires from touching and to protect us
from electric shock.
Insulators do not conduct because they have full or nearly full valence
shells and thus their electrons are tightly bound. However, when high
enough voltage is applied, the force is so great that electrons are literally torn
from their parent atoms, causing the insulation to break down and conduc-
tion to occur. In air, you see this as an arc or flashover. In solids, charred
insulation usually results.
Semiconductors
Silicon and germanium (plus a few other materials) have half-filled valence
shells and are thus neither good conductors nor good insulators. Known as
semiconductors, they have unique electrical properties that make them
important to the electronics industry. The most important material is silicon.
It is used to make transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, and other electronic
devices. Semiconductors have made possible personal computers, VCRs,
portable CD players, calculators, and a host of other electronic products. You
will study them in great detail in your electronics courses.

The Unit of Electrical Charge: The Coulomb
As noted in the previous section, the unit of electrical charge is the coulomb
(C). The coulomb is defined as the charge carried by 6.24  1018 electrons.
Thus, if an electrically neutral (i.e., uncharged) body has 6.24  1018 elec-
trons removed, it will be left with a net positive charge of 1 coulomb, i.e.,
Q  1 C. Conversely, if an uncharged body has 6.24  1018 electrons added,
it will have a net negative charge of 1 coulomb, i.e., Q  1 C. Usually,
however, we are more interested in the charge moving through a wire. In this
regard, if 6.24  1018 electrons pass through a wire, we say that the charge
that passed through the wire is 1 C.
We can now determine the charge on one electron. It is Qe  1/(6.24 
1018)  1.60  1019 C.

EXAMPLE 2–1

charge?
Solution
Initially the body is neutral, i.e., Qinitial  0 C. When 1.7 mC of
electrons is removed, the body is left with a positive charge of 1.7 mC. Now,
18.7  1011 electrons are added back. This is equivalent to

2. 32.8 nC, both () or both ();
3. 14 mC ()

2.3
Voltage
When charges are detached from one body and transferred to another, a
potential difference or voltage results between them. A familiar example is
the voltage that develops when you walk across a carpet. Voltages in excess
of ten thousand volts can be created in this way. (We will define the volt rig-
orously very shortly.) This voltage is due entirely to the separation of posi-
tive and negative charges.
Figure 2–7 illustrates another example. During electrical storms, elec-
trons in thunderclouds are stripped from their parent atoms by the forces of
turbulence and carried to the bottom of the cloud, leaving a deficiency of
electrons (positive charge) at the top and an excess (negative charge) at the
bottom. The force of repulsion then drives electrons away beneath the cloud,
leaving the ground positively charged. Hundreds of millions of volts are cre-
ated in this way. (This is what causes the air to break down and a lightning
discharge to occur.)
Practical Voltage Sources
As the preceding examples show, voltage is created solely by the separation
of positive and negative charges. However, static discharges and lightning
strikes are not practical sources of electricity. We now look at practical
sources. A common example is the battery. In a battery, charges are sepa-
rated by chemical action. An ordinary flashlight battery (dry cell) illustrates
the concept in Figure 2–8. The inner electrode is a carbon rod and the outer
electrode is a zinc case. The chemical reaction between the ammonium-chlo-
ride/manganese-dioxide paste and the zinc case creates an excess of elec-

a battery, since “cell” refers to a

through common usage, such

In what follows, we will also
call them batteries.
NOTES...

trons; hence, the zinc carries a negative charge. An alternate reaction leaves
the carbon rod with a deficiency of electrons, causing it to be positively
charged. These separated charges create a voltage (1.5 V in this case)
between the two electrodes. The battery is useful as a source since its chemi-
cal action creates a continuous supply of energy that is able to do useful
work, such as light a lamp or run a motor.
Potential Energy
The concept of voltage is tied into the concept of potential energy. We there-
fore look briefly at energy.
In mechanics, potential energy is the energy that a body possesses
because of its position. For example, a bag of sand hoisted by a rope over a
pulley has the potential to do work when it is released. The amount of work
that went into giving it this potential energy is equal to the product of force
times the distance through which the bag was lifted (i.e., work equals force
times distance).
In a similar fashion, work is required to move positive and negative
charges apart. This gives them potential energy. To understand why, consider
again the cloud of Figure 2–7. Assume the cloud is initially uncharged. Now
assume a charge of Q electrons is moved from the top of the cloud to the
bottom. The positive charge left at the top of the cloud exerts a force on the
electrons that tries to pull them back as they are being moved away. Since
the electrons are being moved against this force, work (force times distance)
is required. Since the separated charges experience a force to return to the
top of the cloud, they have the potential to do work if released, i.e., they pos-
sess potential energy.
Definition of Voltage: The Volt
In electrical terms, a difference in potential energy is defined as voltage. In
general, the amount of energy required to separate charges depends on the
voltage developed and the amount of charge moved. By definition, the volt-
age between two points is one volt if it requires one joule of energy to move
one coulomb of charge from one point to the other. In equation form,
V  W
Q

[volts, V]
(2–2)
where W is energy in joules, Q is charge in coulombs, and V is the resulting
voltage in volts.
Note carefully that voltage is defined between points. For the case of the
battery, for example, voltage appears between its terminals. Thus, voltage
does not exist at a point by itself; it is always determined with respect to
some other point. (For this reason, voltage is also called potential differ-
ence. We often use the terms interchangeably.) Note also that, although we
considered static electricity in developing the energy argument, the same
conclusion results regardless of how you separate the charges; this may be
by chemical means as in a battery, by mechanical means as in a generator, by
photoelectric means as in a solar cell, and so on.
Section 2.3 I Voltage
37

Although Equation 2–2 is the formal definition of voltage, it is a bit
abstract. A more satisfying way to look at voltage is to view it as the force or
“push” that moves electrons around a circuit. This view is looked at in great
detail, starting in Chapter 4 where we consider Ohm’s law. For the moment,
however, we will stay with Equation 2–2, which is important because it pro-
vides the theoretical foundation for many of the important circuit relation-
ships that you will soon encounter.
Symbol for DC Voltage Sources
Consider again Figure 2–1. The battery is the source of electrical energy that
moves charges around the circuit. This movement of charges, as we will soon
see, is called an electric current. Because one of the battery’s terminals is
always positive and the other is always negative, current is always in the same
direction. Such a unidirectional current is called dc or direct current, and the
battery is called a dc source. Symbols for dc sources are shown in Figure 2–9.
The long bar denotes the positive terminal. On actual batteries, the positive
terminal is usually marked POS () and the negative terminal NEG ().
2.4
Current
Earlier, you learned that there are large numbers of free electrons in metals
like copper. These electrons move randomly throughout the material (Figure
2–6), but their net movement in any given direction is zero.
Assume now that a battery is connected as in Figure 2–10. Since elec-
trons are attracted by the positive pole of the battery and repelled by the neg-

ative pole, they move around the circuit, passing through the wire, the lamp,
and the battery. This movement of charge is called an electric current. The
more electrons per second that pass through the circuit, the greater is the cur-
rent. Thus, current is the rate of flow (or rate of movement) of charge.
The Ampere
Since charge is measured in coulombs, its rate of flow is coulombs per sec-
ond. In the SI system, one coulomb per second is defined as one ampere
(commonly abbreviated A). From this, we get that one ampere is the current
in a circuit when one coulomb of charge passes a given point in one second
(Figure 2–10). The symbol for current is I. Expressed mathematically,

where Q is the charge (in coulombs) and t is the time interval (in seconds)
over which it is measured. In Equation 2–5, it is important to note that t does
not represent a discrete point in time but is the interval of time during which
the transfer of charge occurs. Alternate forms of Equation 2–5 are

Although Equation 2–5 is the theoretical definition of current, we never
actually use it to measure current. In practice, we use an instrument called an
ammeter (Section 2.6). However, it is an extremely important equation that
we will soon use to develop other relationships.
Current Direction
In the early days of electricity, it was believed that current was a movement
of positive charge and that these charges moved around the circuit from the
positive terminal of the battery to the negative as depicted in Figure 2–11(a).
Based on this, all the laws, formulas, and symbols of circuit theory were
developed. (We now refer to this direction as the conventional current
direction.) After the discovery of the atomic nature of matter, it was learned
that what actually moves in metallic conductors are electrons and that they
move through the circuit as in Figure 2–11(b). This direction is called the
electron flow direction. However, because the conventional current direc-
tion was so well established, most users stayed with it. We do likewise. Thus,
in this book, the conventional direction for current is used.

Alternating Current (AC)
So far, we have considered only dc. Before we move on, we will briefly
mention ac or alternating current. Alternating current is current that
changes direction cyclically, i.e., charges alternately flow in one direction,
then in the other in a circuit. The most common ac source is the commercial
ac power system that supplies energy to your home. We mention it here
because you will encounter it briefly in Section 2.5. It is covered in detail in
Chapter 15.

2.5
Practical DC Voltage Sources
Batteries
Batteries are the most common dc source. They are made in a variety of
shapes, sizes, and ratings, from miniaturized button batteries capable of
delivering only a few microamps to large automotive batteries capable of
delivering hundreds of amps. Common sizes are the AAA, AA, C, and D as
illustrated in the various photos of this chapter. All batteries use unlike con-
ductive electrodes immersed in an electrolyte. Chemical interaction between
the electrodes and the electrolyte creates the voltage of the battery.
Primary and Secondary Batteries
Batteries eventually become “discharged.” Some types of batteries, however,
can be “recharged.” Such batteries are called secondary batteries. Other
types, called primary batteries, cannot be recharged. A familiar example of
a secondary battery is the automobile battery. It can be recharged by passing
current through it opposite to its discharge direction. A familiar example of a
primary cell is the flashlight battery.
Types of Batteries and Their Applications
The voltage of a battery, its service life, and other characteristics depend on
the material from which it is made.
Alkaline
This is one of the most widely used, general-purpose primary cells available.
Alkaline batteries are used in flashlights, portable radios, TV remote con-
trollers, cassette players, cameras, toys, and so on. They come in various
sizes as depicted in Figure 2–12. Alkaline batteries provide 50% to 100%
more total energy for the same size unit than carbon-zinc cells. Their nomi-
nal cell voltage is 1.5 V.

2. Briefly describe the mechanism of voltage creation using the carbon-zinc cell
of Figure 2–8 to illustrate.
3. When the switch in Figure 2–1 is open, the current is zero, yet free electrons
in the copper wire are moving about. Describe their motion. Why does their
movement not constitute an electric current?
4. If 12.48  1020 electrons pass a certain point in a circuit in 2.5 s, what is the

5. For Figure 2–1, assume a 12-V battery. The switch is closed for a short
interval, then opened. If I  6 A and the battery expends 230 040 J moving
charge through the circuit, how long was the switch closed?
(Answers are at the end of the chapter.)

Carbon-Zinc
Also called a dry cell, the carbon-zinc battery was for many years the most
widely used primary cell, but it is now giving way to other types such as
the alkaline battery. Its nominal cell voltage is 1.5 volts.
Lithium
Lithium batteries (Figure 2–13) feature small size and long life (e.g., shelf
lives of 10 to 20 years). Applications include watches, pacemakers, cameras,

and battery backup of computer memories. Several types of lithium cells are
available, with voltages from of 2 V to 3.5 V and current ratings from the
microampere to the ampere range.
Nickel-Cadmium
Commonly called “Ni-Cads,” these are the most popular, general-purpose
rechargeable batteries available. They have long service lives, operate over
wide temperature ranges, and are manufactured in many styles and sizes,
including C, D, AAA, and AA. Inexpensive chargers make it economically
feasible to use nickel-cadmium batteries for home entertainment equip-
ment.
Lead-Acid
This is the familiar automotive battery. Its basic cell voltage is about 2
volts, but typically, six cells are connected internally to provide 12 volts at
its terminals. Lead-acid batteries are capable of delivering large current (in
excess of 100 A) for short periods as required, for example, to start an
automobile.
Battery Capacity
Batteries run down under use. Their capacity is specified in ampere-hours
(Ah). The ampere-hour rating of a battery is equal to the product of its cur-
rent drain times the length of time that you can expect to draw the specified
current before the battery becomes unusable. For example, a battery rated at
200 Ah can theoretically supply 20 A for 10 h, or 5 A for 40 h, etc. The rela-
tionship between capacity, life, and current drain is

The capacity of batteries is not a fixed value as suggested above but is
affected by discharge rates, operating schedules, temperature, and other fac-
tors. At best, therefore, capacity is an estimate of expected life under certain
conditions. Table 2–1 illustrates approximate service capacities for several
sizes of carbon-zinc batteries at three values of current drain at 21°C. Under
the conditions listed, the AA cell has a capacity of (3 mA)(450 h)  1350
mAh at a drain of 3 mA, but its capacity decreases to (30 mA)(32 h)  960
mAh at a drain of 30 mA. Figure 2–14 shows a typical variation of capacity
of a Ni-Cad battery with changes in temperature.
Other Characteristics
Because batteries are not perfect, their terminal voltage drops as the amount
of current drawn from them increases. (This issue is considered in Chapter
5.) In addition, battery voltage is affected by temperature and other factors
that affect their chemical activity. However, these factors are not considered
in this book.

prototype development and circuit testing. Figure 2–18 shows a variable
supply.

Measuring Voltage and Current
Voltage and current are measured in practice using instruments called volt-
meters and ammeters. While voltmeters and ammeters are available as
individual instruments, they are more commonly combined into a multipur-
pose instrument called a multimeter or VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter).
Figure 2–20 shows both digital and analog multimeters. Analog instruments

to ac before being fed into the ac system. This plant is rated at 174 kilowatts. (Courtesy

Solar Cells
Solar cells convert light energy to electrical energy using photovoltaic
means. The basic cell consists of two layers of semiconductor material.
When light strikes the cell, many electrons gain enough energy to cross from
one layer to the other to create a dc voltage.
Solar energy has a number of practical applications. Figure 2–19, for
example, shows an array of solar panels supplying power to a commercial ac
network. In remote areas, solar panels are used to power communications
systems and irrigation pumps. In space, they are used to power satellites. In
everyday life, they are used to power hand-held calculators.
DC Generators
Direct current (dc) generators, which convert mechanical energy to electrical
energy, are another source of dc. They create voltage by means of a coil of
wire rotated through a magnetic field. Their principle of operation is similar
to that of ac generators (discussed in Chapter 15).

use a needle pointer to indicate measured values, while digital instruments
use a numeric readout. Digital instruments are more popular than analog
types because they are easier to use.

Multimeters. These are multipurpose test instruments that you can use
to measure voltage, current and resistance. Some meters use terminal markings of  and
, others use V and COM and so on. Color coded test leads (red and black) are indus-
try standard.
Setting the Multimeter for Voltage and Current Measurement
In what follows, we will concentrate on the digital multimeter (DMM) and
leave the analog instruments to your lab course. (It should be noted however
that many of the comments below also apply to analog instruments.)
Multimeters typically have a set of terminals marked V, A, and COM
as can be seen in Figure 2–20, as well as a function selector switch or set
of push buttons that permit you to select functions and ranges. Terminal
V is the terminal to use to measure voltage and resistance, while terminal
A is used for current measurement. The terminal marked COM is the com-
mon terminal for all measurements. (Some multimeters combine the V
and A terminals into one terminal marked VA.) On many instruments the
V terminal is called the  terminal and the COM terminal is called the
 terminal, Figure 2–21.

DMMs as Learning Tools
Voltage and current as presented
earlier in this chapter are rather
abstract concepts involving
energy, charge, and charge
movement. Voltmeters and
ammeters are introduced at this
point to help present the ideas in
more physically meaningful
terms. In particular, we concen-
trate on DMMs. Experience has
shown them to be powerful
learning tools. For example,
when dealing with the some-
times difficult topics of voltage
polarity conventions, current
direction conventions, and so on
(as in later chapters), the use of
DMMs showing readings com-
plete with signs for voltage
polarity and current direction
provides clarity and aids under-
standing in a way that simply
drawing arrows and putting
numbers on diagrams does not.
You will find that in the first few
chapters of this book DMMs are
used for this purpose quite fre-
quently.

When set to dc current ( ), the multimeter measures the dc current passing

How to Measure Voltage
Since voltage is the potential difference between two points, you measure
voltage by placing the voltmeter leads across the component whose voltage
you wish to determine. Thus, to measure the voltage across the lamp of Fig-
ure 2–22, connect the leads as shown. If the meter is not autoscale and you
have no idea how large the voltage is, set the meter to its highest range, then
work your way down to avoid damage to the instrument.
Be sure to note the sign of the measured quantity. (Most digital instru-
ments have an autopolarity feature that automatically determines the sign
for you.) If the meter is connected as in Figure 2–21(a) with its  lead con-
nected to the  terminal of the battery, the display will show 47.2 as indi-
cated, while if the leads are reversed, the display will show 47.2.
Most DMMs have internal cir-
cuitry that automatically selects
the correct range for voltage mea-
surement. Such instruments are
called“autoranging”or“autoscal-
ing” devices.
NOTES…

How to Measure Current
As indicated by Figure 2–21(b), the current that you wish to measure must
pass through the meter. Consider Figure 2–23(a). To measure this current,
open the circuit as in (b) and insert the ammeter. The sign of the reading will
be positive if current enter the A or () terminal or negative if it enters the
COM (or ) terminal as described in the Practical Note.

positive, the point where the red lead is

point where the black lead is con-
nected.
PRACTICAL NOTES...
By convention, DMMs and VOMs have one red lead and one black lead, with
the red lead connected to the () or VA terminal of the meter and the black
connected to the () or COM terminal. Thus, if the voltmeter indicates a pos-
itive value, the point where the red lead is touching is positive with respect to
the point where the black lead is touching; inversely, if the meter indicates
negative, the point where the red lead is touching is negative with respect to
the point where the black lead is connected. For current measurements, if an
ammeter indicates a positive value, this means that the direction of current is
into its () or VA terminal and out of its () or COM terminal; conversely,
if the reading is negative, this means that the direction of current is into the
meter’s COM terminal and out of its () or VA terminal.

Reading Analog Multimeters
Consider the analog meter of Figure 2–24. Note that it has a selector switch
for selecting dc volts, ac volts, dc current, and ohms plus a variety of scales
to go with these functions and their ranges. To measure a quantity, set the
selector switch to the desired function and range, then read the value from
the appropriate scale.

Meter Symbols
In our examples so far, we have shown meters pictorially. Usually, however,
they are shown schematically. The schematic symbol for a voltmeter is a cir-
cle with the letter V, while the symbol for an ammeter is a circle with the let-
ter I. The circuits of Figures 2–22 and 2–23 have been redrawn (Figure
2–26) to indicate this.

PRACTICAL NOTES...
1. One sometimes hears statements such as “. . . the voltage through a resis-
tor” or “. . . the current across a resistor.” These statements are incorrect.
Voltage does not pass through anything; voltage is a potential difference
and appears across things. This is why we connect a voltmeter across com-
ponents to measure their voltage. Similarly, current does not appear across
anything; current is a flow of charge that passes through circuit elements.
This is why we put the ammeter in the current path—to measure the cur-
rent in it. Thus, the correct statements are “. . . voltage across the resistor
. . .” and “. . . current through the resistor . . . .”
2. Do not connect ammeters directly across a voltage source. Ammeters have
nearly zero resistance and damage will probably result.

2.7
Switches, Fuses, and Circuit Breakers
Switches
The most basic switch is a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch as shown
in Figure 2–27. With the switch open, the current path is broken and the
lamp is off; with it closed, the lamp is on. This type of switch is used, for
example, for light switches in homes.
Figure 2–28(a) shows a single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) switch. Two
of these switches may be used as in (b) for two-way control of a light. This
type of arrangement is sometimes used for stairway lights; you can turn the
light on or off from either the bottom or the top of the stairs.

Many other configurations of switches exist in practice. However, we will
leave the topic at this point.
Fuses and Circuit Breakers
Fuses and circuit breakers are used to protect equipment or wiring against
excessive current. For example, in your home, if you connect too many
appliances to an outlet, the fuse or circuit breaker in your electrical panel
“blows.” This opens the circuit to protect against overloading and possible
fire. Fuses and circuit breakers may also be installed in equipment such as
your automobile to protect against internal faults. Figure 2–29 shows a vari-
ety of fuses and breakers.
Fuses use a metallic element that melts when current exceeds a preset
value. Thus, if a fuse is rated at 3 A, it will “blow” if more than 3 amps
passes through it. Fuses are made as fast-blow and slow-blow types. Fast-
blow fuses are very fast; typically, they blow in a fraction of a second. Slow-
blow fuses, on the other hand, react more slowly so that they do not blow on
small, momentary overloads.
Circuit breakers work on a different principle. When the current exceeds
the rated value of a breaker, the magnetic field produced by the excessive
current operates a mechanism that trips open a switch. After the fault or
overload condition has been cleared, the breaker can be reset and used again.
Since they are mechanical devices, their operation is slower than that of a
fuse; thus, they do not “pop” on momentary overloads as, for example, when
a motor is started.

ANSWERS TO IN-PROCESS
LEARNING CHECKS
In-Process Learning Check 1
1. An atomconsists of anucleus of protons and neutrons orbited by electrons.The
nucleus is positivebecause protons arepositive, but the atomis neutral because
it contains the same number of electrons as protons, and their charges cancel.
2. The valence shell is the outermost shell. It contains either just the atom’s
valence electrons or additionally, free electrons that have drifted in from other
atoms.
3. The force between charged particles is proportional to the product of their
charges and inversely proportional to the square of their spacing. Since force
decreases as the square of the spacing, electrons far from the nucleus experi-
ence little force of attraction.
4. If a loosely bound electron gains sufficient energy, it may break free from its
parent atom and wander throughout the material. Such an electron is called a
free electron. For materials like copper, heat (thermal energy) can give an
electron enough energy to dislodge it from its parent atom.
5. A normal atom is neutral because it has the same number of electrons as pro-
tons and their charges cancel. An atom that has lost an electron is called a
positive ion, while an atom that has gained an electron is called a negative
ion.
6. The electrons remain in the material.

Y
ou have been introduced to the concepts of voltage and current in previous
chapters and have found that current involves the movement of charge. In a
conductor, the charge carriers are the free electrons which are moved due to the
voltage of an externally applied source. As these electrons move through the
material, they constantly collide with atoms and other electrons within the con-
ductor. In a process similar to friction, the moving electrons give up some of
their energy in the form of heat. These collisions represent an opposition to
charge movement that is called resistance. The greater the opposition (i.e., the
greater the resistance), the smaller will be the current for a given applied voltage.
Circuit components (called resistors) are specifically designed to possess
resistance and are used in almost all electronic and electrical circuits. Although
the resistor is the most simple component in any circuit, its effect is very impor-
tant in determining the operation of a circuit.
Resistance is represented by the symbol R (Figure 3–1) and is measured in
units of ohms (after Georg Simon Ohm). The symbol for ohms is the capital
Greek letter omega ().
In this chapter, we examine resistance in its various forms. Beginning with
metallic conductors, we study the factors which affect resistance in conductors.
Following this, we look at commercial resistors, including both fixed and vari-
able types. We then discuss important nonlinear resistance devices and conclude
with an overview of superconductivity and its potential impact and use.

PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Georg Simon Ohm and Resistance
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS of circuit theory is that between
voltage, current, and resistance. This relationship and the properties of resistance
were investigated by the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854)
using a circuit similar to that of Figure 3–1. Working with Volta’s recently devel-
oped battery and wires of different materials, lengths, and thicknesses, Ohm
found that current depended on both voltage and resistance. For example, for a
fixed resistance, he found that doubling the voltage doubled the current, tripling
the voltage tripled the current, and so on. Also, for a fixed voltage, Ohm found
that the opposition to current was directly proportional to the length of the wire
and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. From this, he was able to
define the resistance of a wire and show that current was inversely proportional
to this resistance; e.g., when he doubled the resistance; he found that the current
decreased to half of its former value.
These two results when combined form what is known as Ohm’s law. (You
will study Ohm’s law in great detail in Chapter 4.) Ohm’s results are of such
fundamental importance that they represent the real beginnings of what we now
call electrical circuit analysis.

3.1
Resistance of Conductors
As mentioned in the chapter preview, conductors are materials which permit
the flow of charge. However, conductors do not all behave the same way.
Rather, we find that the resistance of a material is dependent upon several
factors:
• Type of material
• Length of the conductor
• Cross-sectional area
• Temperature
If a certain length of wire is subjected to a current, the moving elec-
trons will collide with other electrons within the material. Differences at
the atomic level of various materials cause variation in how the collisions
affect resistance. For example, silver has more free electrons than copper,
and so the resistance of a silver wire will be less than the resistance of a
copper wire having the identical dimensions. We may therefore conclude
the following:
The resistance of a conductor is dependent upon the type of material.
If we were to double the length of the wire, we can expect that the num-
ber of collisions over the length of the wire would double, thereby causing
the resistance to also double. This effect may be summarized as follows:
The resistance of a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the
length of the conductor.
A somewhat less intuitive property of a conductor is the effect of cross-
sectional area on the resistance. As the cross-sectional area is increased, the
moving electrons are able to move more freely through the conductor, just as
water moves more freely through a large-diameter pipe than a small-diame-
ter pipe. If the cross-sectional area is doubled, the electrons would be
involved in half as many collisions over the length of the wire. We may sum-
marize this effect as follows:
The resistance of a metallic conductor is inversely proportional to the
cross-sectional area of the conductor.
The factors governing the resistance of a conductor at a given tempera-
ture may be summarized mathematically as follows:
R  r

[ohms, ]
(3–1)
where
r  resistivity, in ohm-meters (-m)
  length, in meters (m)
A  cross-sectional area, in square meters (m2).
In the above equation the lowercase Greek letter rho (r) is the constant of
proportionality and is called the resistivity of the material. Resistivity is a
physical property of a material and is measured in ohm-meters (-m) in the
SI system. Table 3–1 lists the resistivities of various materials at a tempera-
ture of 20°C. The effects on resistance due to changes in temperature will be
examined in Section 3.4.

Electrical Wire Tables
Although the SI system is the standard measurement for electrical and
other physical quantities, the English system is still used extensively in the
United States and to a lesser degree throughout the rest of the English-
speaking world. One area which has been slow to convert to the SI system
is the designation of cables and wires, where the American Wire Gauge
(AWG) is the primary system used to denote wire diameters. In this sys-
tem, each wire diameter is assigned a gauge number. The higher the AWG
number, the smaller the diameter of the cable or wire, e.g., AWG 22 gauge
wire is a smaller diameter than AWG 14 gauge. Since cross-sectional area
is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter, a given length of 22-
gauge wire will have more resistance than an equal length of 14-gauge
wire. Because of the difference in resistance, we can intuitively deduce that
large-diameter cables will be able to handle more current than smaller-
diameter cables. Table 3–2 provides a listing of data for standard bare cop-
per wire.
Even though Table 3–2 provides data for solid conductors up to AWG
4/0, most applications do not use solid conductor sizes beyond AWG 10.
Solid conductors are difficult to bend and are easily damaged by mechanical
flexing. For this reason, large-diameter cables are nearly always stranded

rather than solid. Stranded wires and cables use anywhere from seven
strands, as shown in Figure 3–4, to in excess of a hundred strands.
As one might expect, stranded wire uses the same AWG notation as
solid wire. Consequently, AWG 10 stranded wire will have the same cross-
sectional conductor area as AWG 10 solid wire. However, due to the addi-
tional space lost between the conductors, the stranded wire will have a larger
overall diameter than the solid wire. Also, because the individual strands are
coiled as a helix, the overall strand length will be slightly longer than the
cable length.
Wire tables similar to Table 3–2 are available for stranded copper cables
and for cables constructed of other materials (notably aluminum).

Solution
From Table 3–2, we see thatAWG 16 wire has a resistance of 4.02 

By examining Table 3–2, several important points may be observed:
• If the wire size increases by three gauge sizes, the cross-sectional area will
approximately double. Since resistance is inversely proportional to cross-
sectional area, a given length of larger-diameter cable will have a resis-
tance which is approximately half as large as the resistance of a similar
length of the smaller-diameter cable.
• If there is a difference of three gauge sizes between cables, then the larger-
diameter cable will be able to handle approximately twice as much current
as the smaller-diameter cable. The amount of current that a conductor can
safely handle is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area.
• If the wire size increases by ten gauge sizes, the cross-sectional area will
increase by a factor of about ten. Due to the inverse relationship between
resistance and cross-sectional area, the larger-diameter cable will have about
onetenththe resistance ofasimilarlengthofthe smaller-diametercable.
• For a 10-gauge difference in cable sizes, the larger-diameter cable will
have ten times the cross-sectional area of the smaller-diameter cable and
so it will be able to handle approximately ten times more current.

If AWG 14 solid copper wire is able to handle 15 A of cur-
rent, determine the expected current capacity of AWG 24 and AWG 8 copper
wire at 20°C.

Resistance of Wires—Circular Mils
The American Wire Gauge system for specifying wire diameters was devel-
oped using a unit called the circular mil (CM), which is defined as the area
contained within a circle having a diameter of 1 mil (1 mil  0.001 inch). A
square mil is defined as the area contained in a square having side dimen-
sions of 1 mil. By referring to Figure 3–5, it is apparent that the area of a cir-
cular mil is smaller than the area of a square mil.
Because not all conductors have circular cross-sections, it is occasion-
ally necessary to convert areas expressed in square mils into circular mils.
We will now determine the relationship between the circular mil and the
square mil.
Section 3.3 I Resistance of Wires—Circular Mils
65
Solution
Since AWG 24 is ten sizes smaller than AWG 14, the smaller
cable will be able to handle about one tenth the capacity of the larger-diame-
ter cable.
AWG 24 will be able to handle approximately 1.5 A of current.
AWG 8 is six sizes larger than AWG 14. Since current capacity doubles
for an increase of three sizes, AWG 11 would be able to handle 30 A and
AWG 8 will be able to handle 60 A.

(Answers are at the end of the chapter.)

Suppose that a wire has the circular cross section shown in Figure
3–5(a). By applying Equation 3–2, the area, in square mils, of the circular
cross section is determined as follows:

1 CM  p
4
 sq. mil
(3–3)
1 sq. mil  p

(3–4)
The greatest advantage of using the circular mil to express areas of wires
is the simplicity with which calculations may be made. Unlike previous area
calculations which involved the use of p, area calculations may be reduced
to simply finding the square of the diameter.
If we are given a circular cross section with a diameter, d (in mils) the
area of this cross-section is determined as
A  p

Using Equation 3–4, we convert the area from square mils to circular mils.
Consequently, if the diameter of a circular conductor is given in mils, we
determine the area in circular mils as

b. 0.500 inch
Solution
a. d  0.0159 inch
 (0.0159 inch)(1000 mils/inch)
 15.9 mils
Now, using Equation 3–5, we obtain
ACM  (15.9)2  253 CM.
From Table 3–2, we see that the above result is precisely the area given for
AWG 26 wire.

In Example 3–5(b) we see that the cross-sectional area of a cable may be a
large number when it is expressed in circular mils. In order to simplify the units
for area, the Roman numeral M is often used to represent 1000. If a wire has
a cross-sectional area of 250 000 CM, it is more easily written as 250 MCM.
Clearly, this is a departure from the SI system, where M is used to repre-
sent one million. Since there is no simple way to overcome this conflict, the
student working with cable areas expressed in MCM will need to remember
that the M stands for one thousand and not for one million.

b. From Table 3–2, we see that AWG 2/0 cable has a cross-sectional area of

ing number of cables:

This example illustrates that 15 cables would need to be installed to be
equivalent to a single 6-inch by 0.25-inch bus bar. Due to the expense and awk-
wardness of using this many cables, we see the economy of using solid bus bar.
The main disadvantage of using bus bar is that the conductor is not covered
with an insulation, and so the bus bar does not offer the same protection as
cable. However, since bus bar is generally used in locations where only expe-
rienced technicians are permitted access, this disadvantage is a minor one.

Although the original equation used SI units, the equation will also
apply if the units are expressed in any other convenient system. If cable
length is generally expressed in feet and the area in circular mils, then
the resistivity must be expressed in the appropriate units. Table 3–3 gives
the resistivities of some conductors represented in circular mil-ohms per
foot.
The following example illustrates how Table 3–3 may be used to deter-
mine the resistance of a given section of wire.

Temperature Effects
Section 3.1 indicated that the resistance of a conductor will not be constant
at all temperatures. As temperature increases, more electrons will escape
their orbits, causing additional collisions within the conductor. For most con-
ducting materials, the increase in the number of collisions translates into a
relatively linear increase in resistance, as shown in Figure 3–6.

Temperature effects on the resistance of a conductor.
The rate at which the resistance of a material changes with a variation in
temperature is called the temperature coefficient of the material and is
assigned the Greek letter alpha (a). Some materials have only very slight
changes in resistance, while other materials demonstrate dramatic changes in
resistance with a change in temperature.
Any material for which resistance increases as temperature increases is
said to have a positive temperature coefficient.
For semiconductor materials such as carbon, germanium, and silicon,
increases in temperature allow electrons to escape their usually stable orbits
and become free to move within the material. Although additional collisions
do occur within the semiconductor, the effect of the collisions is minimal
when compared with the contribution of the extra electrons to the overall
flow of charge. As the temperature increases, the number of charge electrons
increases, resulting in more current. Therefore, an increase in temperature
results in a decrease in resistance. Consequently, these materials are referred
to as having negative temperature coefficients.
Table 3–4 gives the temperature coefficients, a per degree Celsius, of
various materials at 20°C and at 0°C.

If we consider that Figure 3–6 illustrates how the resistance of copper
changes with temperature, we observe an almost linear increase in resistance
as the temperature increases. Further, we see that as the temperature is
decreased to absolute zero (T  273.15°C), the resistance approaches zero.
In Figure 3–6, the point at which the linear portion of the line is extrapo-
lated to cross the abscissa (temperature axis) is referred to as the tempera-
ture intercept or the inferred absolute temperature T of the material.
By examining the straight-line portion of the graph, we see that we have
two similar triangles, one with the apex at point 1 and the other with the
apex at point 2. The following relationship applies for these similar triangles.

An alternate method of determining the resistance, R2 of a conductor at a

stant for all temperatures, but rather is dependent upon the temperature of
the material. The temperature coefficient for any material is defined as

Types of Resistors
Virtually all electric and electronic circuits involve the control of voltage
and/or current. The best way to provide such control is by inserting appropri-
ate values of resistance into the circuit. Although various types and sizes of
resistors are used in electrical and electronic applications, all resistors fall
into two main categories: fixed resistors and variable resistors.
Fixed Resistors
As the name implies, fixed resistors are resistors having resistance values
which are essentially constant. There are numerous types of fixed resistors,
ranging in size from almost microscopic (as in integrated circuits) to high-
power resistors which are capable of dissipating many watts of power. Fig-
ure 3–7 illustrates the basic structure of a molded carbon composition
resistor.

Structure of a molded carbon composition resistor.
As shown in Figure 3–7, the molded carbon composition resistor con-
sists of a carbon core mixed with an insulating filler. The ratio of carbon to
filler determines the resistance value of the component: the higher the pro-
portion of carbon, the lower the resistance. Metal leads are inserted into the
carbon core, and then the entire resistor is encapsulated with an insulated
coating. Carbon composition resistors are available in resistances from less
than 1  to 100 M and typically have power ratings from 1⁄8 W to 2 W.
Figure 3–8 shows various sizes of resistors, with the larger resistors being
able to dissipate more power than the smaller resistors.
Although carbon-core resistors have the advantages of being inexpensive
and easy to produce, they tend to have wide tolerances and are susceptible to

large changes in resistance due to temperature variation. As shown in Figure
3–9, the resistance of a carbon composition resistor may change by as much
as 5% when temperature is changed by 100°C.
Other types of fixed resistors include carbon film, metal film, metal
oxide, wire-wound, and integrated circuit packages.
If fixed resistors are required in applications where precision is an
important factor, then film resistors are usually employed. These resistors
consist of either carbon, metal, or metal-oxide film deposited onto a ceramic
cylinder. The desired resistance is obtained by removing part of the resistive
material, resulting in a helical pattern around the ceramic core. If variation of
resistance due to temperature is not a major concern, then low-cost carbon is
used. However, if close tolerances are required over a wide temperature
range, then the resistors are made of films consisting of alloys such as nickel

Occasionally a circuit requires a resistor to be able to dissipate large
quantities of heat. In such cases, wire-wound resistors may be used. These
resistors are constructed of a metal alloy wound around a hollow porcelain
core which is then covered with a thin layer of porcelain to seal it in place.
The porcelain is able to quickly dissipate heat generated due to current
through the wire. Figure 3–10 shows a few of the various types of power resis-
tors available.

In circuits where the dissipation of heat is not a major design considera-
tion, fixed resistances may be constructed in miniature packages (called inte-
grated circuits or ICs) capable of containing many individual resistors. The
obvious advantage of such packages is their ability to conserve space on a
circuit board. Figure 3–11 illustrates a typical resistor IC package.
Variable Resistors
Variable resistors provide indispensable functions which we use in one form
or another almost daily. These components are used to adjust the volume of
our radios, set the level of lighting in our homes, and adjust the heat of our
stoves and furnaces. Figure 3–12 shows the internal and the external view of
typical variable resistors.

In Figure 3–13, we see that variable resistors have three terminals, two
of which are fixed to the ends of the resistive material. The central terminal
is connected to a wiper which moves over the resistive material when the
shaft is rotated with either a knob or a screwdriver. The resistance between
the two outermost terminals will remain constant while the resistance
between the central terminal and either terminal will change according to the
position of the wiper.
If we examine the schematic of a variable resistor as shown in Figure
3–13(b), we see that the following relationship must apply:

(3–9)
Variable resistors are used for two principal functions. Potentiometers,
shown in Figure 3–13(c), are used to adjust the amount of potential (voltage)
provided to a circuit. Rheostats, the connections and schematic of which are
shown in Figure 3–14, are used to adjust the amount of current within a cir-
cuit. Applications of potentiometers and rheostats will be covered in later
chapters.

3.6
Color Coding of Resistors
Large resistors such as the wire-wound resistors or the ceramic-encased
power resistors have their resistor values and tolerances printed on their
cases. Smaller resistors, whether constructed of a molded carbon composi-
tion or a metal film, may be too small to have their values printed on the
component. Instead, these smaller resistors are usually covered by an epoxy
or similar insulating coating over which several colored bands are printed
radially as shown in Figure 3–15.
The colored bands provide a quickly recognizable code for determining
the value of resistance, the tolerance (in percentage), and occasionally the
expected reliability of the resistor. The colored bands are always read from
left to right, left being defined as the side of the resistor with the band near-
est to it.
The first two bands represent the first and second digits of the resistance
value. The third band is called the multiplier band and represents the number
of zeros following the first two digits; it is usually given as a power of ten.
The fourth band indicates the tolerance of the resistor, and the fifth band (if
present) is an indication of the expected reliability of the component. The

reliability is a statistical indication of the expected number of components
which will no longer have the indicated resistance value after 1000 hours of
use. For example, if a particular resistor has a reliability of 1% it is expected
that after 1000 hours of use, no more than one resistor in 100 is likely to be
outside the specified range of resistance as indicated in the first four bands
of the color codes. Table 3–5 shows the colors of the various bands and the
corresponding values.

18.9 k. After 1000 hours, we would expect that no more than 1 resistor in
1000 would fall outside the specified range.

Measuring Resistance—The Ohmmeter
The ohmmeter is an instrument which is generally part of a multimeter
(usually including a voltmeter and an ammeter) and is used to measure the
resistance of a component. Although it has limitations, the ohmmeter is used
almost daily in service shops and laboratories to measure resistance of com-
ponents and also to determine whether a circuit is faulty. In addition, the
ohmmeter may also be used to determine the condition of semiconductor
devices such as diodes and transistors. Figure 3–17 shows both an analog
ohmmeter and the more modern digital ohmmeter.
In order to measure the resistance of an isolated component or circuit,
the ohmmeter is placed across the component under test, as shown in Figure
3–18. The resistance is then simply read from the meter display.
When using an ohmmeter to measure the resistance of a component which
is located in an operating circuit, the following steps should be observed:
1. As shown in Figure 3–19(a), remove all power supplies from the circuit or
component to be tested. If this step is not followed, the ohmmeter reading
will, at best, be meaningless, and the ohmmeter may be severely damaged.
2. If you wish to measure the resistance of a particular component, it is nec-
essary to isolate the component from the rest of the circuit. This is done
by disconnecting at least one terminal of the component from the balance
of the circuit as shown in Figure 3–19(b). If this step is not followed, in
all likelihood the resistance reading indicated by the ohmmeter will not
be the resistance of the desired resistor, but rather the resistance of the
combination.

3. As shown in Figure 3–19(b), connect the two probes of the ohmmeter
across the component to be measured. The black and red leads of the
ohmmeter may be interchanged when measuring resistors. When measur-
ing resistance of other components, however, the measured resistance will
be dependent upon the direction of the sensing current. Such devices are
covered briefly in a later section of this chapter.
4. Ensure that the ohmmeter is on the correct range to provide the most
accurate reading. For example, although a digital multimeter (DMM) can
measure a reading for a 1.2-k resistor on the 2-M range, the same
ohmmeter will provide additional significant digits (hence more preci-
sion) when it is switched to the 2-k range. For analog meters, the best
accuracy is obtained when the needle is approximately in the center of the
scale.
5. When you are finished, turn the ohmmeter off. Because the ohmmeter
uses an internal battery to provide a small sensing current, it is possible to
drain the battery if the probes accidently connect together for an extended
period.

In addition to measuring resistance, the ohmmeter may also be used to
indicate the continuity of a circuit. Many modern digital ohmmeters have an
audible tone which indicates that a circuit is unbroken from one point to
another point. As demonstrated in Figure 3–20(a), the audible tone of a digi-
tal ohmmeter allows the user to determine continuity without having to look
away from the circuit under test.
Ohmmeters are particularly useful instruments in determining whether a
given circuit has been short circuited or open circuited.
A short circuit occurs when a low-resistance conductor such as a piece
of wire or any other conductor is connected between two points in a circuit.
Due to the very low resistance of the short circuit, current will bypass the
rest of the circuit and go through the short. An ohmmeter will indicate a very
low (theoretically zero) resistance when used to measure across a short cir-
cuit.
An open circuit occurs when a conductor is broken between the points
under test. An ohmmeter will indicate infinite resistance when used to mea-
sure the resistance of a circuit having an open circuit.
Figure 3–20 illustrates circuits having a short circuit and an open circuit.

PRACTICAL NOTES...
When a digital ohmmeter measures an open circuit, the display on the meter
will usually be the digit 1 at the left-hand side, with no following digits. This
reading should not be confused with a reading of 1 , 1 k, or 1 M, which
would appear on the right-hand side of the display.

Thermistors
In Section 3.4 we saw how resistance changes with changes in temperature.
While this effect is generally undesirable in resistors, there are many appli-
cations which use electronic components having characteristics which vary
according to changes in temperature. Any device or component which
causes an electrical change due to a physical change is referred to as a
transducer.
A thermistor is a two-terminal transducer in which resistance changes
significantly with changes in temperature (hence a thermistor is a “thermal
resistor”). The resistance of thermistors may be changed either by external
temperature changes or by changes in temperature caused by current through
the component. By applying this principle, thermistors may be used in cir-
cuits to control current and to measure or control temperature. Typical appli-

cations include electronic thermometers and thermostatic control circuits for
furnaces. Figure 3–21 shows a typical thermistor and its electrical symbol.
Thermistors are constructed of oxides of various materials such as
cobalt, manganese, nickel, and strontium. As the temperature of the thermis-
tor is increased, the outermost (valence) electrons in the atoms of the mater-
ial become more active and break away from the atom. These extra electrons
are now free to move within the circuit, thereby causing a reduction in the
resistance of the component (negative temperature coefficient). Figure 3–22
shows how resistance of a thermistor varies with temperature effects.

Photoconductive Cells
Photoconductive cells or photocells are two-terminal transducers which
have a resistance determined by the amount of light falling on the cell. Most
photocells are constructed of either cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium
selenide (CdSe) and are sensitive to light having wavelengths between 4000
Å (blue light) and 10 000 Å (infrared). The angstrom (Å) is a unit commonly
used to measure the wavelength of light and has a dimension given as 1 Å 
1  1010 m. Light, which is a form of energy, strikes the material of the
photocell and causes the release of valence electrons, thereby reducing the
resistance of the component. Figure 3–23 shows the structure, symbol, and
resistance characteristics of a typical photocell.
Photocells may be used to measure light intensity and/or to control light-
ing. They are typically used as part of a security system.

3.10
Nonlinear Resistance
Up to this point, the components we have examined have had values of resis-
tance which were essentially constant for a given temperature (or, in the case
of a photocell, for a given amount of light). If we were to examine the cur-
rent versus voltage relationship for these components, we would find that the
relationship is linear, as shown in Figure 3–24.
If a device has a linear (straight-line) current-voltage relation then it is
referred to as an ohmic device. (The linear current-voltage relationship will be
will be covered in greater detail in the next chapter.) Often in electronics, we use
components which do not have a linear current-voltage relationship; these
devices are referred to as nonohmic devices. On the other hand, some compo-
nents, such as the thermistor, can be shown to have both an ohmic region and a
nonohmic region. For large current through the thermistor, the component will
get hotter. This increase in temperature will result in a decrease of resistance.
Consequently, for large currents, the thermistor is a nonohmic device.
We will now briefly examine two common nonohmic devices.
Diodes
The diode is a semiconductor device which permits charge to flow in only
one direction. Figure 3–25 illustrates the appearance and the symbol of a
typical diode.

Linear current-

Conventional current through a diode is in the direction from the anode
toward the cathode (the end with the line around the circumference). When
current is in this direction, the diode is said to be forward biased and oper-
ating in its forward region. Since a diode has very little resistance in its for-
ward region, it is often approximated as a short circuit.
If the circuit is connected such that the direction of current is from the
cathode to the anode (against the arrow in Figure 3–25), the diode is reverse
biased and operating in its reverse region. Due to the high resistance of a
reverse-biased diode, it is often approximated as an open circuit.
Although this textbook does not attempt to provide an in-depth study of
diode theory, Figure 3–26 shows the basics of diode operation both when
forward biased and when reverse biased.

PRACTICAL NOTES...
Because an ohmmeter uses an internal voltage source to generate a small
sensing current, the instrument may easily be used to determine the terminals
(and hence the direction of conventional flow) of a diode. (See Figure 3–27.)
If we measure the resistance of the diode in both directions, we will find that
the resistance will be low when the positive terminal of the ohmmeter is con-
nected to the anode of the diode. When the positive terminal is connected to
the cathode, virtually no current will occur in the diode and so the indication
on the ohmmeter will be a very high resistance (theoretically, R   ).

Varistors are used in sensitive circuits, such as those in computers, to
ensure that if the voltage suddenly exceeds a predetermined value, the varis-
tor will effectively become a short circuit to the unwanted signal, thereby
protecting the rest of the circuit from excessive voltage.
3.11
Conductance
Conductance, G, is defined as the measure of a material’s ability to allow
the flow of charge and is assigned the SI unit the siemens (S). A large con-
ductance indicates that a material is able to conduct current well, whereas a
low value of conductance indicates that a material does not readily permit
the flow of charge. Mathematically, conductance is defined as the reciprocal
of resistance. Thus

where R is resistance, in ohms ().
Varistors
Varistors, as shown in Figure 3–28, are semiconductor devices which have
very high resistances when the voltage across the varistors is below the
breakdown value. However, when the voltage across a varistor (either polar-
ity) exceeds the rated value, the resistance of the device suddenly becomes
very small, allowing charge to flow. Figure 3–29 shows the current-voltage
relation for varistors.

Superconductors
As you have seen, all power lines and distribution networks have internal
resistance which results in energy loss due to heat as charge flows through
the conductor. If there was some way of eliminating the resistance of the
conductors, electricity could be transmitted farther and more economically.
The idea that energy could be transmitted without losses along a “supercon-
ductor” transmission line was formerly a distant goal. However, recent dis-
coveries in high-temperature superconductivity promise the almost magical
ability to transmit and store energy with no loss in energy.

In 1911, the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered the
phenomenon of superconductivity. Studies of mercury, tin, and lead verified
that the resistance of these materials decreases to no more than one ten-bil-
lionth of the room temperature resistance when subjected to temperatures of
4.6 K, 3.7 K, and 6 K respectively. Recall that the relationship between
kelvins and degrees Celsius is as follows:
TK  T(°C)  273.15°
(3–12)
The temperature at which a material becomes a superconductor is referred to
as the critical temperature, TC, of the material. Figure 3–30 shows how the
resistance of a sample of mercury changes with temperature. Notice how the
resistance suddenly drops to zero at a temperature of 4.6 K.
Experiments with currents in supercooled loops of superconducting wire
have determined that the induced currents will remain undiminished for
many years within the conductor provided that the temperature is maintained
below the critical temperature of the conductor.
A peculiar, seemingly magical property of superconductors occurs when
a permanent magnet is placed above the superconductor. The magnet will
float above the surface of the conductor as if it is defying the law of gravity,
as shown in Figure 3–31.
This principle, which is referred to as the Meissner effect (named after
Walther Meissner), may be simply stated as follows:
When a superconductor is cooled below its critical temperature, mag-
netic fields may surround but not enter the superconductor.
The principle of superconductivity is explained in the behavior of elec-
trons within the superconductor. Unlike conductors which have electrons
moving randomly through the conductor and colliding with other electrons
[Figure 3–32(a)], the electrons in superconductors form pairs which move
through the material in a manner similar to a band marching in a parade. The
orderly motion of electrons in a superconductor, shown in Figure 3–32(b),
results in an ideal conductor, since the electrons no longer collide.
The economy of having a high critical temperature has led to the search
for high-temperature superconductors. In recent years, research at the IBM
Zurich Research Laboratory in Switzerland and the University of Houston in
Texas has yielded superconducting materials which are able to operate at
temperatures as high as 98 K (175°C). While this temperature is still very

(a) In conductors, electrons are free to move in any direction through
the conductor. Energy is lost due to collisions with atoms and other electrons, giving rise
to the resistance of the conductor. (b) In superconductors, electrons are bound in pairs
and travel through the conductor in step, avoiding all collisions. Since there is no energy
loss, the conductor has no resistance.

low, it means that superconductivity can now be achieved by using the read-
ily available liquid nitrogen rather than the much more expensive and rarer
liquid helium.
Superconductivity has been found in such seemingly unlikely materials
as ceramics consisting of barium, lanthanum, copper, and oxygen. Research
is now centered on developing new materials which become superconductors
at ever higher temperatures and which are able to overcome the disadvan-
tages of the early ceramic superconductors.
Very expensive, low-temperature superconductivity is currently used in
some giant particle accelerators and, to a limited degree, in electronic com-
ponents (such as superfast Josephson junctions and SQUIDs, i.e., supercon-
ducting quantum interference devices, which are used to detect very small
magnetic fields). Once research produces commercially viable, high-temper-
ature superconductors, however, the possibilities of the applications will be
virtually limitless. High-temperature superconductivity promises to yield
improvements in transportation, energy storage and transmission, computers,
and medical treatment and research. It is quite possible that high-temperature
superconductivity will change electronics as much as the invention of the
transistor.

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
Y
ou are a troubleshooting specialist working for a small telephone com-
pany. One day, word comes in that an entire subdivision is without tele-
phone service. Everyone suspects that a cable was cut by one of several back-
hoe operators working on a waterline project near the subdivision. However,
no one is certain exactly where the cut occurred. You remember that the resis-
tance of a length of wire is determined by several factors, including the
length. This gives you an idea for determining the distance between the tele-
phone central office and location of the cut.
First you go to the telephone cable records, which show that the subdivi-
sion is served by 26-gauge copper wire. Then, since each customer’s tele-
phone is connected to the central office with a pair of wires, you measure the
resistance of several loops from the central office. As expected, some of the
measurements indicate open circuits. However, several pairs of the wire were
shorted by the backhoe, and each of these pairs indicates a total resistance of
338 . How far from the central office did the cut occur?

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Georg Simon Ohm
IN CHAPTER 3, WE LOOKED BRIEFLY at Ohm’s experiments. We now take a look
at Ohm the person.
Georg Simon Ohm was born in Erlangen, Bavaria, on March 16, 1787. His
father was a master mechanic who determined that his son should obtain an edu-
cation in science. Although Ohm became a teacher in a high school, he had aspi-
rations to receive a university appointment. The only way that such an appoint-
ment could be realized would be if Ohm could produce important results
through scientific research. Since the science of electricity was in its infancy,
and because the electric cell had recently been invented by the Italian Conte
Alessandro Volta, Ohm decided to study the behavior of current in resistive cir-
cuits. Because equipment was expensive and hard to come by, Ohm made much
of his own, thanks, in large part, to his father’s training. Using this equipment,
Ohm determined experimentally that the amount of current transmitted along a
wire was directly proportional to its cross-sectional area and inversely propor-
tional to its length. From these results, Ohm was able to define resistance and
show that there was a simple relationship between voltage, resistance, and cur-
rent. This result, now known as Ohm’s law, is probably the most fundamental
relationship in circuit theory. However, when published in 1827, Ohm’s results
were met with ridicule. As a result, not only did Ohm miss out on a university
appointment, he was forced to resign from his high-school teaching position.
While Ohm was living in poverty and shame, his work became known and
appreciated outside Germany. In 1842, Ohm was appointed a member of the
Royal Society. Finally, in 1849, he was appointed as a professor at the Univer-
sity of Munich, where he was at last recognized for his important contributions.

4.1
Ohm’s Law
Consider the circuit of Figure 4–1. Using a circuit similar in concept to this,
Ohm determined experimentally that current in a resistive circuit is directly
proportional to its applied voltage and inversely proportional to its resis-
tance. In equation form, Ohm’s law states

R

[amps, A]
(4–1)
where
E is the voltage in volts,
R is the resistance in ohms,
I is the current in amperes.
From this you can see that the larger the applied voltage, the larger the cur-
rent, while the larger the resistance, the smaller the current.

encounter circuits with other orientations. For these, the same principles
apply; as you saw in Figure 4–4, simply draw the current arrow pointing out

Ohm’s Law in Graphical Form
The relationship between current and voltage described by Equation 4–1
may be shown graphically as in Figure 4–7. The graphs, which are straight
lines, show clearly that the relationship between voltage and current is linear,
i.e., that current is directly proportional to voltage.
Open Circuits
Current can only exist where there is a conductive path (e.g., a length of
wire). For the circuit of Figure 4–8, I equals zero since there is no conductor
between points a and b. We refer to this as an open circuit. Since I  0, sub-
stitution of this into Equation 4–3 yields
R  E
I
  E
0
 ⇒  ohms
Thus, an open circuit has infinite resistance.
Voltage Symbols
Two different symbols are used to represent voltage. For sources, use upper-
case E; for loads (and other components), use uppercase V. This is illustrated
in Figure 4–9.
Using the symbol V, Ohm’s law may be rewritten in its several forms as
I  V
R

[amps]
(4–4)
V  IR
[volts]
(4–5)

These relationships hold for every resistor in a circuit, no matter how complex
the circuit. Since V  IR, these voltages are often referred to as IR drops.

Voltage Polarity and Current Direction
So far, we have paid little attention to the polarity of voltages across resis-
tors. However, polarity is of extreme importance; fortunately, there is a sim-
ple relationship between current direction and voltage polarity. To get at the
idea, consider Figure 4–11(a). Here the polarity of V is obvious since the
resistor is connected directly to the source. This makes the top end of the
resistor positive with respect to the bottom end, and V  E  12 V as indi-
cated by the meters.

Now consider current. The direction of I is from top to bottom through
the resistor as indicated by the current direction arrow. Examining voltage
polarity, we see that the plus sign for V is at the tail of this arrow. This obser-
vation turns out to be true in general and gives us a convention for marking
voltage polarity on circuit diagrams. For voltage across a resistor, always
place the plus sign at the tail of the current reference arrow. Two additional

Before We Move On
Before we move on, we will comment on one more aspect of current repre-
sentation. First, note that to completely specify current, you must include
both its value and its direction. (This is why we show current direction
reference arrows on circuit diagrams.) Normally we show the current com-
ing out of the plus () terminal of the source as in Figure 4–14(a). (Here,
I  E/R  5 A in the direction shown. This is the actual direction of the
current.) As you can see from this (and all preceding examples in this chap-
ter), determining the actual current direction in single-source networks is
easy. However, when analyzing complex circuits (such as those with multi-
ple sources as in later chapters), it is not always easy to tell in advance in
what direction all currents will be. As a result, when you solve such prob-
lems, you may find that some currents have negative values. What does this
mean?
To get at the answer, consider both parts of Figure 4–14. In (a), current
is shown in the usual direction, while in (b), it is shown in the opposite
direction. To compensate for the reversed direction, we have changed the
sign of I. The interpretation placed on this is that a positive current in one
direction is the same as a negative current in the opposite direction. There-
fore, (a) and (b) are two representations of the same current. Thus, if during
the solution of a problem you obtain a positive value for current, this means
that its actual direction is the same as the reference arrow; if you obtain a
negative value, its direction is opposite to the reference arrow. This is an
important idea and one that you will use many times in later chapters. It was

will leave its consideration and use to later chapters. That is, we will con-
tinue to use the representation of Figure 4–14(a).
4.3
Power
Power is familiar to all of us, at least in a general sort of way. We know, for
example, that electric heaters and light bulbs are rated in watts (W) and that
motors are rated in horsepower (or watts), both being units of power as dis-
cussed in Chapter 1. We also know that the higher the watt rating of a device,
the more energy we can get out of it per unit time. Figure 4–15 illustrates the
idea. In (a), the greater the power rating of the light, the more light energy that
it can produce per second. In (b), the greater the power rating of the heater, the
more heat energy it can produce per second. In (c), the larger the power rating
of the motor, the more mechanical work that it can do per second.
104
Chapter 4 I Ohm’s Law, Power, and Energy
As you can see, power is related to energy, which is the capacity to do
work. Formally, power is defined as the rate of doing work or, equivalently,
as the rate of transfer of energy. The symbol for power is P. By definition,
P  W
t

[watts, W]
(4–7)
where W is the work (or energy) in joules and t is the corresponding time
interval of t seconds.
The SI unit of power is the watt. From Equation 4–7, we see that P also
has units of joules per second. If you substitute W  1 J and t  1 s you get
P  1 J/1 s  1 W. From this, you can see that one watt equals one joule per
second. Occasionally, you also need power in horsepower. To convert, recall
that 1 hp  746 watts.

NOTES...

Power in Electrical and Electronic Systems

of electrical quantities. Recall from Chapter 2 that voltage is defined as work
per unit charge and current as the rate of transfer of charge, i.e.,

Section 4.4 I Power Direction Convention
107
Power Rating of Resistors
Resistors must be able to safely dissipate their heat without damage. For this
reason, resistors are rated in watts. (For example, composition resistors of
the type used in electronics are made with standard ratings of 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1,
and 2 W as you saw in Figure 3–8.) To provide a safety margin, it is custom-
ary to select a resistor that is capable of dissipating two or more times its
computed power. By overrating a resistor, it will run a little cooler.
PRACTICAL NOTES...
A properly chosen resistor is able to dissipate its heat safely without becom-
ing excessively hot. However, if through bad design or subsequent component
failure its current becomes excessive, it will overheat and damage may result,
as shown in Figure 4–18. One of the symptoms of overheating is that the
resistor becomes noticeably hotter than other resistors in the circuit. (Be care-
ful, however, as you might get burned if you try to check by touch.) Compo-
nent failure may also be detected by smell. Burned components have a char-
acteristic odor that you will soon come to recognize. If you detect any of
these symptoms, turn the equipment off and look for the source of the prob-
lem. Note, however, an overheated component is often the symptom of a
problem, rather than its cause.
Measuring Power
Power can be measured using a device called a wattmeter. However, since
wattmeters are used primarily for ac power measurement, we will hold off
their consideration until Chapter 17. (You seldom need a wattmeter for dc
circuits since you can determine power directly as the product of voltage
times current and V and I are easy to measure.)
4.4
Power Direction Convention
For circuits with one source and one load, energy flows from the source to
the load and the direction of power transfer is obvious. For circuits with mul-
tiple sources and loads, however, the direction of energy flow in some parts
of the network may not be at all apparent. We therefore need to establish a
clearly defined power transfer direction convention.
A resistive load (Figure 4–19) may be used to illustrate the idea. Since
the direction of power flow can only be into a resistor, never out of it (since
resistors do not produce energy), we define the positive direction of power
transfer as from the source to the load as in (a) and indicate this by means of
an arrow: P→. We then adopt the convention that, for the relative voltage
polarities and current and power directions shown in Figure 4–19(a), when
power transfer is in the direction of the arrow, it is positive, whereas when it
is in the direction opposite to the arrow, it is negative.
To help interpret the convention, consider Figure 4–19(b), which high-
lights the source end. From this we see that power out of a source is positive
FIGURE 4–18
The resistor on the
right has been damaged by overheating.

when both the current and power arrows point out from the source, both I and
P have positive values, and the source voltage has the polarity indicated.
Now consider Figure 4–19(c), which highlights the load end. Note the
relative polarity of the load voltage and the direction of the current and
power arrows. From this, we see that power to a load is positive when both
the current and power direction arrows point into the load, both have posi-
tive values, and the load voltage has the polarity indicated.
In Figure 4–19(d), we have generalized the concept. The box may con-
tain either a source or a load. If P has a positive value, power transfer is into
the box; if P has a negative value, its direction is out.

EXAMPLE 4–9
Use the above convention to describe power transfer for
the electric vehicle of Figure 4–20.
Solution
During normal operation, the batteries supply power to the
motors, and current and power are both positive, Fig. 4–20(b). However,
when the vehicle is going downhill, its motors are driven by the weight of the
car and they act as generators. Since the motors now act as the source and the
batteries as the load, the actual current is opposite in direction to the refer-
ence arrow shown and is thus negative (recall Figure 4–14). Thus, P  VI is
negative. The interpretation is, therefore, that power transfer is in the direc-
tion opposite to the power reference arrow. For example, if V  48 volts
and I  10 A, then P  VI  (48 V)(10 A)  480 W. This is consis-
tent with what is happening, since minus 480 W into the motors is the same
as plus 480 W out. This 480 W of power flows from the motors to the batter-
ies, helping to charge them as the car goes downhill.

4.5
Energy
Earlier (Equation 4–7), we defined power as the rate of doing work. When
you transpose this equation, you get the formula for energy:
W  Pt
(4–14)
If t is measured in seconds, W has units of watt-seconds (i.e., joules, J),
while if t is measured in hours, W has units of watthours (Wh). Note that in
Equation 4–14, P must be constant over the time interval under considera-
tion. If it is not, apply Equation 4–14 to each interval over which P is con-
stant as described later in this section. (For the more general case, you need
calculus.)
The most familiar example of energy usage is the energy that we use in
our homes and pay for on our utility bills. This energy is the energy used by
the lights and electrical appliances in our homes. For example, if you run a
100-W lamp for 1 hour, the energy consumed is W  Pt  (100 W)(1h) 
100 Wh, while if you run a 1500-W electric heater for 12 hours, the energy
consumed is W  (1500 W)(12 h)  18 000 Wh.
The last example illustrates that the watthour is too small a unit for
practical purposes. For this reason, we use kilowatthours (kWh). By defin-
ition,

Thus, for the above example, W  18 kWh. In most of North America, the
kilowatthour (kWh) is the unit used on your utility bill.
For multiple loads, the total energy is the sum of the energy of individ-
ual loads.
Section 4.5 I Energy
109
EXAMPLE 4–10
Determine the total energy used by a 100-W lamp for 12
hours and a 1.5-kW heater for 45 minutes.
Solution
Convert all quantities to the same set of units, e.g., convert 1.5 kW
to 1500 W and 45 minutes to 0.75 h. Then,
W  (100 W)(12 h)  (1500 W)(0.75 h)  2325 Wh  2.325 kWh
Alternatively, convert all power to kilowatts first. Thus,
W  (0.1 kW)(12 h)  (1.5 kW)(0.75 h)  2.325 kWh
EXAMPLE 4–11
Suppose you use the following electrical appliances: a 1.5-
kW heater for 71⁄2 hours; a 3.6-kW broiler for 17 minutes; three 100-W lamps
for 4 hours; a 900-W toaster for 6 minutes. At $0.09 per kilowatthour, how
much will this cost you?

In those areas of the world where the SI system dominates, the mega-
joule (MJ) is sometimes used instead of the kWh (as the kWh is not an SI
unit). The relationship is 1 kWh  3.6 MJ.
Watthour Meter
In practice, energy is measured by watthour meters, many of which are
electromechanical devices that incorporate a small electric motor whose
speed is proportional to power to the load. This motor drives a set of dials
through a gear train (Figure 4–21). Since the angle through which the dials
rotate depends on the speed of rotation (i.e., power consumed) and the length
of time that this power flows, the dial position indicates energy used. Note
however, that electromechanical devices are starting to give way to elec-
tronic meters, which perform this function electronically and display the
result on digital readouts.

Law of Conservation of Energy
Before leaving this section, we consider the law of conservation of energy. It
states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but is instead converted
from one form to another. You saw examples of this above—for example, the

conversion of electrical energy into heat energy by a resistor, and the conversion
of electrical energy into mechanical energy by a motor. In fact, several types of
energy may be produced simultaneously. For example, electrical energy is
converted to mechanical energy by a motor, but some heat is also produced.
This results in a lowering of efficiency, a topic we consider next.
4.6
Efficiency
Poor efficiency results in wasted energy and higher costs. For example, an
inefficient motor costs more to run than an efficient one for the same output.
An inefficient piece of electronic gear generates more heat than an efficient
one, and this heat must be removed, resulting in increased costs for fans,
heat sinks, and the like.
Efficiency can be expressed in terms of either energy or power. Power is
generally easier to measure, so we usually use power. The efficiency of a
device or system (Figure 4–22) is defined as the ratio of power output Pout to
power input Pin, and it is usually expressed in percent and denoted by the
Greek letter h (eta). Thus,

power delivered to the load (e.g., speakers) to the power drawn from the
power supply. Generally, this efficiency is not very high. For example, sup-

Nonlinear and Dynamic Resistances
All resistors considered so far have constant values that do not change with
voltage or current. Such resistors are termed linear or ohmic since their cur-
rent-voltage (I-V) plot is a straight line. However, the resistance of some
materials changes with voltage or current. These materials are termed non-
linear because their I-V plot is curved (Figure 4–25).
Since the resistance of all materials changes with temperature, all resis-
tors are to some extent nonlinear, since they all produce heat and this heat
changes their resistance. For most resistors, however, this effect is small over
their normal operating range, and such resistors are considered to be linear.
(The commercial resistors shown in Figure 3–8 and most others that you will
encounter in this book are linear.)
Since an I-V plot is a graph of Ohm’s law, resistance can be computed
from the ratio V/I. First, consider the linear plot of Figure 4–25. Because the
slope is constant, the resistance is constant and you can compute R at any
point. For example, at V  10 V, I  20 mA, and R  10 V/20 mA  500 .
Similarly, at V  20 V, I  40 mA, and R  20 V/40 mA  500 , which is
the same as before. This is true at all points on this linear curve. The result-
ing resistance is referred to as dc resistance, Rdc. Thus, Rdc  500 .
An alternate way to compute resistance is illustrated in Figure 4–26. At
point 1, V1  I1R. At point 2, V2  I2R. Subtracting voltages and solving for
R yields

where V/I is the inverse of the slope of the line. (Here,  is the Greek let-
ter delta. It is used to represent a change or increment in value.) To illustrate,
if you select V to be 20 V, you find that the corresponding I from Figure
4–26 is 40 mA. Thus, R  V/I  20 V/40 mA  500  as before. Resis-
tance calculated as in Figure 4–26 is called ac or dynamic resistance. For
linear resistors, Rac  Rdc.

Now consider the nonlinear resistance plot of Figure 4–25. At V  20 V,
I  20 mA. Therefore, Rdc  20 V/20 mA  1.0 k; at V  120 V, I  60
mA, and Rdc  120 V/60 mA  2.0 k. This resistance therefore increases
with applied voltage. However, for small variations about a fixed point on
the curve, the ac resistance will be constant. This is an important concept in
electronics. However, since dynamic resistance is beyond the scope of this
book, we must leave it for later courses to explore.

Computer-Aided Circuit Analysis
We end our introduction to Ohm’s law by solving several simple problems
using Electronics Workbench and OrCAD PSPice. As noted in Chapter 1,
these are application packages that work from a circuit schematic that you
build on your screen. (Since the details are different, we will consider the
two products separately, using the circuit of Figure 4–27 to get started.)
Because this is our first look at circuit simulation, considerable detail is
included. (Although the procedures may seem complex, they become quite
intuitive with a little practice.) Both packages run under Windows.

Electronics Workbench
Figure 4–28 shows an Electronics Workbench (EWB) user interface screen.
(This is Version 5, the version current at the time of writing.) Along the top
are toolbars with icons and menu items that you can select with your mouse.
(Drop-down boxes open to indicate the purpose of your selection.) For
example, if you position the mouse pointer over the Basic icon and click the
left button, the Basic Parts bin shown in Figure 4–28 opens.
First read the EWB Operational Notes, then build the circuit on the
screen as follows:
• Click the New icon to allow creation of a new circuit.
• Click the Sources icon, drag a battery from the parts bin, position it on the
screen then release the mouse button.
• Click the Basic icon, drag a resistor from the parts bin, rotate it 90° by
clicking the Rotate icon, then position it. (If the resistor won’t rotate, it
isn’t selected—see EWB Operational Notes.)
• To “wire” the circuit, move the mouse pointer to the top battery terminal
and when a dot appears, as in Figure 4–29(a), click and drag the wire to
the top of the resistor as in (b). Release the mouse button and the wire
routes itself neatly as in (c). Similarly, add the bottom wire.

• Drag a connector dot from the basic parts bin, position it as shown in Fig-
ure 4–28, then add a ground symbol from the sources bin. (Note: Make
sure the ground connects properly. See also Note 7.)
• Open the Indicators parts bin and drag an ammeter into position. (EWB
automatically rewires the circuit to accommodate the ammeter.)
• Drag a voltmeter from the Indicators parts bin, then wire it into place.
• To change the battery voltage, double click the battery symbol and when
the dialog box opens, click the Value tab (if not already selected), type 25,
select V, then click OK.
• Similarly, double click the resistor symbol, click the Value tab, type 12.5,
select , then click OK.
• Activate the circuit by clicking the ON/OFF power switch at the top right
corner of the EWB window.

EWB Operational Notes
1. Unless directed otherwise,
use the left mouse button for
all operations.
2. To drag a component, place
the pointer over it, press and
hold the left mouse button,
drag the mouse across its pad
to position the component,
then release the button.
3. To select a component on the
screen, place the pointer on it
and click the left button. The
component turns red.
4. To deselect a component,
move the cursor to an empty
point on the screen and click
the left button.
5. To delete a component, select
it, then press the Delete key.
6. Some components have
default values that you may
need to change.
7. The order of wiring a circuit
sometimes has an effect. For
example, for Figure 4–28, if
you connect the ground to the
source before you add the
wire from the bottom end of
the resistor, the connector dot
may not be needed.
8. All EWB circuits need a
ground.
NOTES...

The voltmeter should show 25 V and the ammeter 2 A as indicated in Figure
4–28.

PRACTICE
PROBLEMS 4
Repeat the above example, except reverse the source voltage symbol so that the
circuit is driven by a 25 V source. Note the voltmeter and ammeter readings and
compare to the above solution. Reconcile these results with the voltage polarity
and current direction conventions discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 2.
OrCAD PSpice
You must specify the type of analysis that you wish to perform. Your choices
are DC Sweep (for dc analysis which is what we are doing here), AC Sweep
(for AC analysis), Time Domain (for transient analysis), or Bias Point
(which we do not consider in this book). When setting up your analysis,
there are generally several ways you can proceed, but the following is about
the simplest. Lastly, it is assumed that you have loaded PSpice from the
demo disk. Now, read the PSpice Operational Notes, then:
• On your Windows screen, click Start, select Programs, OrCAD Demo,
then click Capture CIS Demo. This opens the Capture session frame
(Appendix A, Figure A–1).
• Click menu item File, select New, and then click Project. The New Project
box (Figure A–2) opens. In the Name box, type Ch 4 PSpice 1, then click
the Analog or Mixed-Signal Circuit Wizard button. Click OK.
• You are prompted to add libraries. Click breakout.olb and click Add, click
eval.olb and click Add, and then click Finish. (Various components exist in
these libraries. For example, sources are in the SOURCE library, resistors
are in the ANALOG library, and so on. You will learn more about where
components are located as you go through the PSpice examples.)
• You should be on the Capture schematic editor page. Click anywhere to
activate it. You are now ready to build the circuit. Let us start with the volt-
age source. Click the Place part tool (Figure 4–30) to open the Place Part
dialog box. From the Libraries list, select SOURCE, then type VDC in the
Part box. Click OK and a dc voltage source symbol appears. Position it on
the screen as shown in Figure 4–30, click the left button to place it, then
press the Esc key to end placement (or click the right button and End
Mode as described in Appendix A).
• Click the Place part tool and select ANALOG from the Libraries list, then
in the Part box, type R and click OK. A resistor appears. Rotate it three
times as described in the PSpice Operational Notes box (for reasons
described in Appendix A). Place as shown in Figure 4–30 using the left
button, and then press Esc.
• To measure current, you need an ammeter. For this, use component
IPRINT. Click the Place part tool and select SPECIAL from the Libraries
list. In the Part box, type IPRINT and then click OK. Place the component
and then press Esc.
• Click the Place ground tool, select 0/SOURCE and click OK. Place the
ground as in Figure 4–30, and then press Esc.

Chapter 4 I Ohm’s Law, Power, and Energy
FIGURE 4–30
OrCAD PSpice simulation of Figure 4–27. Note that PSpice uses V for
sources instead of E, although you can change this if you wish.
• To wire the circuit, click the Place wire tool, position the cursor in the lit-
tle box at the end of the source lead, and click. Then move the cursor to
IPRINT and click to place. Wire the rest of the circuit in this manner. Press
Esc to end wire placement.
• All components have default values that need to be changed. First, con-
sider the resistor. Its default value is 1k. To change it, double click the 1k
value (not the resistor symbol), type 12.5 into the Value box, and then
click OK. Similarly, double click the IPRINT symbol, click the Parts tab
(bottom of screen) in the Properties Editor, then scroll right until you see a
cell labeled DC. Type yes into the cell and click Apply. Close the editor by
clicking the  box in the upper right-hand corner of the Properties Editor
window. This returns you to Figure 4–30.
• Click the New Simulation Profile icon (Figure 4–30). Enter a name (e.g.,
Figure 4-30) in the Name box. Click Create. A Simulations Setting box
opens. Click the Analysis tab. From the Analysis type list, select DC
Sweep. From the Options list, select Primary Sweep. Under Sweep vari-
able, choose Voltage source. In the Name box, type the name of your
source. (It should be V1. Check your schematic to verify.) Click the Value
list button, type 25V into the box, and then click OK. (This sets the volt-
age of your source to 25 V but it does not update the screen display. If you
want to update the value on your screen, double click the default value
(i.e., 0V, not the battery symbol), type 25V in the Value box, and click
OK.) Click the Save Document icon to save your work.

Plotting Ohm’s Law
PSpice can be used to compute and graph results. By varying the source
voltage of Figure 4–27 and plotting I for example, you can obtain a plot of
Ohm’s law. Proceed as follows.
• Follow the steps detailed earlier to call up the Schematic page editor. In
the New Project box, type Ch 4 PSpice 2 into the Name box. Build the
circuit of Figure 4–30 again (right up to the point where you have wired
the circuit), except omit part IPRINT.
• Click the New Simulation Profile icon and enter Figure 4–32 in the Name
box. Click Create. In the Simulations Settings box, click the Analysis tab
and from the Analysis type list, select DC Sweep. From the Options list,
select Primary Sweep. Under the Sweep Variable, choose Voltage source.
In the Name box, type the name of your source. (It should be V1.) Under
Sweep type, choose Linear. Type 0V in the Start Value box, type 100V in
the End Value box, and type 5V in the Increment box, and then click OK.
(This will sweep the voltage from 0 to 100 V in 5-V steps.)

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE

ou have been assigned to perform a design review and cost analysis of
an existing product. The product uses a 12-V 5% power supply. After
a catalog search, you find a new power supply with a specification of 12 V
2%, which, because of its newer technology, costs only five dollars more
than the one you are currently using. Although it provides improved perfor-
mance for the product, your supervisor won’t approve it because of the extra
cost. However, the supervisor agrees that if you can bring the cost differential
down to $3.00 or less, you can use the new supply. You then look at the
schematic and discover that a number of precision 1% resistors are used
because of the wide tolerance of the old supply. (As a specific example, a
1% tolerance 220-k resistor is used instead of a standard 5% tolerance
resistor because the loose tolerance of the original power supply results in
current through the resistor that is out of spec. Its current must be between 50
mA to 60 mA when the 12-V supply is connected across it. Several other
such instances are present in the product, a total of 15 in all.) You begin to
wonder whether you could replace the precision resistors (which cost $0.24
each) with standard 5% resistors (which cost $0.03 each) and save enough
money to satisfy your supervisor. Perform an analysis to determine if your
hunch is correct.

n the previous chapter we examined the interrelation of current, voltage, resis-
tance, and power in a single resistor circuit. In this chapter we will expand on
these basic concepts to examine the behavior of circuits having several resistors
in series.
We will use Ohm’s law to derive the voltage divider rule and to verify
Kirchhoff’s voltage law. A good understanding of these important principles pro-
vides an important base upon which further circuit analysis techniques are built.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law and Kirchhoff’s current law, which will be covered in
the next chapter, are fundamental in understanding all electrical and electronic
circuits.
After developing the basic framework of series circuit analysis, we will
apply the ideas to analyze and design simple voltmeters and ohmmeters. While
meters are usually covered in a separate instruments or measurements course, we
examine these circuits merely as an application of the concepts of circuit analysis.
Similarly, we will observe how circuit principles are used to explain the
loading effect of an ammeter placed in series with a circuit.

PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff
KIRCHHOFF WAS A GERMAN PHYSICIST born on March 12, 1824, in Königsberg,
Prussia. His first research was on the conduction of electricity, which led to his
presentation of the laws of closed electric circuits in 1845. Kirchhoff’s current
law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law apply to all electrical circuits and therefore are
fundamentally important in understanding circuit operation. Kirchhoff was the
first to verify that an electrical impulse travelled at the speed of light.
Although these discoveries have immortalized Kirchhoff’s name in electri-
cal science, he is better known for his work with R. W. Bunsen in which he
made major contributions in the study of spectroscopy and advanced the
research into blackbody radiation.
Kirchhoff died in Berlin on October 17, 1887.

5.1
Series Circuits
An electric circuit is the combination of any number of sources and loads
connected in any manner which allows charge to flow. The electric circuit
may be simple, such as a circuit consisting of a battery and a light bulb. Or
the circuit may be very complex, such as the circuits contained within a tele-
vision set, microwave oven, or computer. However, no matter how compli-
cated, each circuit follows fairly simple rules in a predictable manner. Once
these rules are understood, any circuit may be analyzed to determine the
operation under various conditions.
All electric circuits obtain their energy either from a direct current (dc)
source or from an alternating current (ac) source. In the next few chapters,
we examine the operation of circuits supplied by dc sources. Although ac
circuits have fundamental differences when compared with dc circuits, the
laws, theorems, and rules that you learn in dc circuits apply directly to ac
circuits as well.
In the previous chapter, you were introduced to a simple dc circuit con-
sisting of a single voltage source (such as a chemical battery) and a single
load resistance. The schematic representation of such a simple circuit was
covered in Chapter 4 and is shown again in Figure 5–1.
While the circuit of Figure 5–1 is useful in deriving some important con-
cepts, very few practical circuits are this simple. However, we will find that
even the most complicated dc circuits can generally be simplified to the cir-
cuit shown.
We begin by examining the most simple connection, the series connec-
tion. In Figure 5–2, we have two resistors, R1 and R2, connected at a single
point in what is said to be a series connection.
Two elements are said to be in series if they are connected at a single
point and if there are no other current-carrying connections at this point.
A series circuit is constructed by combining various elements in series,
as shown in Figure 5–3. Current will leave the positive terminal of the volt-
age source, move through the resistors, and return to the negative terminal of
the source.
In the circuit of Figure 5–3, we see that the voltage source, E, is in series
with R1, R1 is in series with R2, and R2 is in series with E. By examining this
circuit, another important characteristic of a series circuit becomes evident.
In an analogy similar to water flowing in a pipe, current entering an element
must be the same as the current leaving the element. Now, since current does
not leave at any of the connections, we conclude that the following must be
true.
The current is the same everywhere in a series circuit.
While the above statement seems self-evident, we will find that this will
help to explain many of the other characteristics of a series circuit.

The Voltage Polarity Convention Revisited
The ,  sign convention of Figure 5–4(a) has a deeper meaning than so far
considered. Voltage exists between points, and when we place a  at one
point and a  at another point, we define this to mean that we are looking at
the voltage at the point marked  with respect to the point marked . Thus,
in Figure 5–4(b), V  6 volts means that point a is 6 V positive with respect
to point b. Since the red lead of the meter is placed at point a and the black
at point b, the meter will indicate 6 V.
Now consider Figure 5–5(b). [Part (a) has been repeated from Figure
5–4(b) for reference.] Here, we have placed the plus sign at point b,
meaning that you are looking at the voltage at b with respect to a. Since
point b is 6 V negative with respect to point a, V will have a value of
minus 6 volts, i.e., V  6 volts. Note also that the meter indicates 6
volts since we have reversed its leads and the red lead is now at point b
and the black at point a. It is important to realize here that the voltage
across R has not changed. What has changed is how we are looking at it
and how we have connected the meter to measure it. Thus, since the
actual voltage is the same in both cases, (a) and (b) are equivalent repre-
sentations.

5.2
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
Next to Ohm’s law, one of the most important laws of electricity is Kirch-
hoff’s voltage law (KVL) which states the following:
The summation of voltage rises and voltage drops around a closed loop
is equal to zero. Symbolically, this may be stated as follows:
 V  0
for a closed loop
(5–1)
In the above symbolic representation, the uppercase Greek letter sigma
() stands for summation and V stands for voltage rises and drops. A
closed loop is defined as any path which originates at a point, travels
around a circuit, and returns to the original point without retracing any seg-
ments.
An alternate way of stating Kirchhoff’s voltage law is as follows:
The summation of voltage rises is equal to the summation of voltage
drops around a closed loop.
Erises  Vdrops
for a closed loop
(5–2)
If we consider the circuit of Figure 5–7, we may begin at point a in the
lower left-hand corner. By arbitrarily following the direction of the current,
I, we move through the voltage source, which represents a rise in potential
from point a to point b. Next, in moving from point b to point c, we pass
through resistor R1, which presents a potential drop of V1. Continuing
through resistors R2 and R3, we have additional drops of V2 and V3 respec-
tively. By applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop, we
arrive at the following mathematical statement for the given circuit:
E  V1  V2  V3  0
Although we chose to follow the direction of current in writing Kirch-
hoff’s voltage law equation, it would be just as correct to move around the

Chapter 5 I Series Circuits
Solution
In each case, place the plus sign at the tail of the current direction
arrow. Then, for (a), you are looking at the polarity of a with respect to b and
you get V  IR  (3 A)(2 )  6 V as expected. Now consider (b). The
polarity markings mean that you are looking at the polarity of b with respect
to a and you get V  IR  (3 A)(2 )  6 V. This means that point b
is 6 V negative with respect to a, or equivalently, a is 6 V positive with
respect to b. Thus, the two voltages are equal.

5.3
Resistors in Series
Almost all complicated circuits can be simplified. We will now examine how
to simplify a circuit consisting of a voltage source in series with several
resistors. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 5–10.
Since the circuit is a closed loop, the voltage source will cause a current
I in the circuit. This current in turn produces a voltage drop across each
resistor, where
Vx  IRx
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the closed loop gives
E  V1  V2  …  Vn
 IR1  IR2  …  IRn
 I(R1  R2  …  Rn)
If we were to replace all the resistors with an equivalent total resistance,
RT, then the circuit would appear as shown in Figure 5–11.
However, applying Ohm’s law to the circuit of Figure 5–11 gives
E  IRT
(5–3)
Since the circuit of Figure 5–11 is equivalent to the circuit of Figure 5–
10, we conclude that this can only occur if the total resistance of the n series
resistors is given as
RT  R1  R2  …  Rn

If each of the n resistors has the same value, then the total resistance is

Voltage Sources in Series
If a circuit has more than one voltage source in series, then the voltage
sources may effectively be replaced by a single source having a value that is
the sum or difference of the individual sources. Since the sources may have
different polarities, it is necessary to consider polarities in determining the
resulting magnitude and polarity of the equivalent voltage source.
If the polarities of all the voltage sources are such that the sources
appear as voltage rises in given direction, then the resultant source is deter-
mined by simple addition, as shown in Figure 5–15.
If the polarities of the voltage sources do not result in voltage rises in the
same direction, then we must compare the rises in one direction to the rises
in the other direction. The magnitude of the resultant source will be the sum
of the rises in one direction minus the sum of the rises in the opposite direc-
tion. The polarity of the equivalent voltage source will be the same as the
polarity of whichever direction has the greater rise. Consider the voltage
sources shown in Figure 5–16.
If the rises in one direction were equal to the rises in the opposite direc-
tion, then the resultant voltage source would be equal to zero.

Very often, once the circuits have been redrawn it becomes easier to
visualize the circuit operation. Therefore, we will regularly use the technique
of interchanging components to simplify circuits before we analyze them.

5.6
The Voltage Divider Rule
The voltage dropped across any series resistor is proportional to the magni-
tude of the resistor. The total voltage dropped across all resistors must equal
the applied voltage source(s) by KVL.
Consider the circuit of Figure 5–20.
We see that the total resistance RT  10 k results in a circuit current of
I  1 mA. From Ohm’s law, R1 has a voltage drop of V1  2.0 V, while
R2, which is four times as large as R1, has four times as much voltage drop,
V2  8.0 V.
We also see that the summation of the voltage drops across the resistors
is exactly equal to the voltage rise of the source, namely,
E  10 V  2 V  8 V
The voltage divider rule allows us to determine the voltage across any
series resistance in a single step, without first calculating the current. We

We may redraw the circuit by the two steps shown in Figure 5–19.
It is necessary to ensure that the voltage sources are correctly moved since it
is quite easy to assign the wrong polarity. Perhaps the easiest way is to imag-
ine that we slide the voltage source around the circuit to the new location.

The previous example illustrates two important points which occur regu-
larly in electronic circuits. If a single series resistance is very large in compari-
son with the other series resistances, then the voltage across that resistor will
be essentially the total applied voltage. On the other hand, if a single resis-
tance is very small in comparison with the other series resistances, then the
voltage drop across the small resistor will be essentially zero. As a general
rule, if a series resistor is more than 100 times larger than another series resis-
tor, then the effect of the smaller resistor(s) may be effectively neglected.

Circuit Ground
Perhaps one of the most misunderstood concepts in electronics is that of
ground. This misunderstanding leads to many problems when circuits are
designed and analyzed.The standard symbol for circuit ground is shown in Fig-
ure 5–24(a), while the symbol for chassis ground is shown in Figure 5–24(b).
In its most simple definition, ground is simply an “arbitrary electrical
point of reference” or “common point” in a circuit. Using the ground symbol
in this manner usually allows the circuit to be sketched more simply. When
the ground symbol is used arbitrarily to designate a point of reference, it
would be just as correct to redraw the circuit schematic showing all the
ground points connected together or indeed to redraw the circuit using an
entirely different point of reference. The circuits shown in Figure 5–25 are
exactly equivalent circuits even though the circuits of Figure 5–25(a) and 5–
25(c) use different points of reference.

FIGURE 5–25
While the ground symbol is used to designate a common point of refer-
ence within a circuit, it usually has a greater meaning to the technologist or
engineer. Very often, the metal chassis of an appliance is connected to the
circuit ground. Such a connection is referred to as a chassis ground and is
usually designated as shown in Figure 5–24(b).

In order to help prevent electrocution, the chassis ground is usually fur-
ther connected to the earth ground through a connection provided at the
electrical outlet box. In the event of a failure within the circuit, the chassis
would redirect current to ground (tripping a breaker or fuse), rather than pre-
senting a hazard to an unsuspecting operator.
As the name implies, the earth ground is a connection which is bonded
to the earth, either through water pipes or by a connection to ground rods.
Everyone is familiar with the typical 120-Vac electrical outlet shown in Fig-
ure 5–26. The rounded terminal of the outlet is always the ground terminal
and is used not only in ac circuits by may also be used to provide a common
point for dc circuits. When a circuit is bonded to the earth through the
ground terminal, then the ground symbol no longer represents an arbitrary
connection, but rather represents a very specific type of connection.

5.8
Voltage Subscripts
Double Subscripts
As you have already seen, voltages are always expressed as the potential
difference between two points. In a 9-V battery, there is a 9-volt rise in
potential from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. Current
through a resistor results in a voltage drop across the resistor such that the
terminal from which charge leaves is at a lower potential than the terminal
into which charge enters. We now examine how voltages within any circuit
may be easily described as the voltage between two points. If we wish to
express the voltage between two points (say points a and b in a circuit),
then we express such a voltage in a subscripted form (e.g., Vab), where the
first term in the subscript is the point of interest and the second term is the
point of reference.
Consider the series circuit of Figure 5–27.
If we label the points within the circuit a, b, c, and d, we see that point b
is at a higher potential than point a by an amount equal to the supply volt-
age. We may write this mathematically as Vba  50 V. Although the plus
sign is redundant, we show it here to indicate that point b is at a higher
potential than point a. If we examine the voltage at point a with respect to
point b, we see that a is at a lower potential than b. This may be written
mathematically as Vab  50 V.
From the above illustration, we make the following general statement:
Vab  Vba
for any two points a and b within a circuit.
Current through the circuit results in voltage drops across the resistors
as shown in Figure 5–27. If we determine the voltage drops on all resistors

and show the correct polarities, then we see that the following must also
apply:
Vbc  10 V
Vcb  10 V
Vcd  25 V
Vdc  25 V
Vda  15 V
Vad  15 V
If we wish to determine the voltage between any other two points within
the circuit, it is a simple matter of adding all the voltages between the two
points, taking into account the polarities of the voltages. The voltage
between points b and d would be determined as follows:
Vbd  Vbc  Vcd  10 V  25 V  35 V
Similarly, the voltage between points b and a could be determined by
using the voltage drops of the resistors:
Vba  Vbc  Vcd  Vda  10 V  25 V  15 V  50 V
Notice that the above result is precisely the same as when we deter-
mined Vba using only the voltage source. This result indicates that the voltage
between two points is not dependent upon the path taken.

Chapter 5 I Series Circuits
1. Determine the circuit current. Calculate the voltage drop across all compo-
nents.
2. Polarize all resistors based upon the direction of the current. The terminal
at which the current enters is assigned to be positive, while the terminal at
which the current leaves is assigned to be negative.
3. In order to determine the voltage at point a with respect to point b, start at
point a. Refer to Figure 5–30. Now, imagine that you walk around the cir-
cuit to the reference point b.
4. As you “walk” around the circuit, add the voltage drops and rises as you
get to them. The assigned polarity of the voltage at any component
(whether it is a source or a resistor) is the first polarity that you arrive at
for the component.
5. The resulting voltage, Vab, is the numerical sum of all the voltages between
a and b.

Single Subscripts
In a circuit which has a reference point (or ground point), most voltages will
be expressed with respect to the reference point. In such a case it is no
longer necessary to express a voltage using a dual subscript. Rather if we
wish to express the voltage at point a with respect to ground, we simply refer
to this as Va. Similarly, the voltage at point b would be referred to as Vb.
Therefore, any voltage which has only a single subscript is always refer-
enced to the ground point of the circuit.

The idea of voltages with respect to ground is easily extended to include

may be simplified in the circuit as a point source as shown in Figure 5–34.
Point sources are often used to simplify the representation of circuits.
We need to remember that in all such cases the corresponding points always
represent voltages with respect to ground (even if ground is not shown).

Internal Resistance of Voltage Sources
So far we have worked only with ideal voltage sources, which maintain con-
stant voltages regardless of the loads connected across the terminals. Consider
a typical lead-acid automobile battery, which has a voltage of approximately
12 V. Similarly, four C-cell batteries, when connected in series, have a com-
bined voltage of 12 V. Why then can we not use four C-cell batteries to operate
the car? The answer, in part, is because the lead-acid battery has a much lower
internal resistance than the low-energy C-cells. In practice, all voltage sources
contain some internal resistance which will reduce the efficiency of the volt-
age source. We may symbolize any voltage source schematically as an ideal
voltage source in series with an internal resistance. Figure 5–37 shows both an
ideal voltage source and a practical or actual voltage source.
The voltage which appears between the positive and negative terminals
is called the terminal voltage. In an ideal voltage source, the terminal volt-
age will remain constant regardless of the load connected. An ideal voltage
source will be able to provide as much current as the circuit demands. How-
ever, in a practical voltage source, the terminal voltage is dependent upon the
value of the load connected across the voltage source. As expected, the prac-
tical voltage source sometimes is not able to provide as much current as the
load demands. Rather the current in the circuit is limited by the combination
of the internal resistance and the load resistance.
Under a no-load condition (RL   ), there is no current in the cir-
cuit and so the terminal voltage will be equal to the voltage appearing
across the ideal voltage source. If the output terminals are shorted together
(RL  0 ), the current in the circuit will be a maximum and the terminal
voltage will be equal to approximately zero. In such a situation, the voltage
dropped across the internal resistance will be equal to the voltage of the
ideal source.
The following example helps to illustrate the above principles.

We now use the concept of a series circuit to analyze a functional circuit,
namely a voltmeter. Although most technologists will seldom need to design
a voltmeter, the principles presented here will help you understand the limi-

FIGURE 5–38

The typical voltmeter consists of a meter movement in series with a
current-limiting resistance. The meter may be either a permanent-magnet
moving coil (PMMC) as shown in Figure 5–39, or a digital panel meter
(DPM).
Although the digital meter is now more common, we will examine
the circuits using the PMMC movement since this type of display is very
simple and easily understood with concepts you have learned. The PMMC
consists of an electromagnet mounted on a spring. When an external volt-
age is applied to the terminals of the voltmeter, a small current will occur
in the voltmeter. As charge flows through the coils of the electromagnet, a
magnetic field is developed. Since this movable coil is located inside a
permanent magnet, the magnets will interact causing the coil to deflect
proportional to the current within the movement. (In later chapters you
will learn more about how magnetic fields may be created by electric cur-
rents.)
The amount of current which causes the movement to deflect to its max-
imum position is referred to as the full-scale deflection current and is usu-
ally abbreviated as Ifsd. The Ifsd of an analog meter can be determined from
the sensitivity of the meter, S, which is generally printed on the meter face
and is given in volts per ohm. The sensitivity is defined to be
S  I
1
fsd

If the current in a circuit is less than Ifsd, then the movement will deflect
an amount proportional to the current as follows:
deflection  If
I
sd
  100%
(5–13)
If excessive current is applied to the meter movement, the fine needle
may be bent or the movement itself may be destroyed.
Due to the extreme length of very fine wire in the electromagnet, the
PMMC usually has a resistance on the order of several thousand ohms.
This resistance, called the meter resistance, is abbreviated as Rm. The
schematic representation of a typical PMMC movement is shown in Figure
5–40.
By combining the PMMC movement with a single series resistor as
shown in Figure 5–41, it is possible to build a simple circuit capable of mea-
suring external voltages.
In the schematic of Figure 5–41, the resistor Rs is used to limit the
amount of current so that the meter movement never receives more than Ifsd.
The value of this resistor is dependent not only on the type of meter move-
ment used, but also on the voltage range of the voltmeter. Clearly we would
like to have maximum meter deflection when the meter detects the maxi-
mum voltage for the particular range. Once we have decided the voltage
range that the meter will be measuring, it is a simple task to scale the meter
with numbers and graticules to help in interpreting a measurement. Such a
scale is shown in Figure 5–42 for a voltmeter having a 10-V range. In the
meter of Figure 5–42, the meter will indicate the maximum voltage (10 V)
when the current through the meter movement is equal to Ifsd.

The voltmeter could not be used on its 20-V range, since this
would cause the current to exceed Ifsd. However, either the 50-V range and the

Ohmmeter Design
In the previous section, we saw how a voltmeter is essentially constructed
from a meter movement in series with a resistance. The movement deflects
an amount which is proportional to the amount of current passing through it.
By employing a similar principle, it is possible to use the same meter move-
ment to construct an ohmmeter.
Unlike the voltmeter, which uses an external voltage to provide the nec-
essary current to cause a deflection within the PMMC movement, an ohm-
meter must have an internal voltage source (usually a battery) to provide the
required sensing current. The schematic of a simple ohmmeter is shown in
Figure 5–47.
In the circuit of Figure 5–47, we can see that no current will be present
until an unknown resistance, Rx, is connected across the open terminals of
the ohmmeter. The ohmmeter is designed so that maximum current will pass
through the meter movement when the resistance connected across the termi-
nals is equal to zero (i.e., a short circuit Rx  0). The scaling of the meter
face plate is determined according to the movement deflection for various
values of unknown resistance.

Although we are occasionally able to measure voltages on more than one
range, it is generally more acceptable to measure on the range which gives
the greatest nonmaximum deflection. In this example, the better range would
therefore be the 50-V range since it provides the greater deflection.

Ammeter Loading Effects
As you have already learned, ammeters are instruments which measure the cur-
rent in a circuit. In order to use an ammeter, the circuit must be disconnected
and the ammeter placed in series with the branch for which the current is to be
determined. Since an ammeter uses the current in the circuit to provide a read-
ing, it will affect the circuit under measurement. This effect is referred to as
meter loading.All instruments, regardless of type, will load the circuit to some
degree. The amount of loading is dependent upon both the instrument and the
circuitbeingmeasured.Foranymeter,wedefine the loadingeffectasfollows:

Similarly, at 50% deflection, the current in the circuit is I  0.500 mA and
the total resistance is RT  18 k. So, the unknown resistance must be Rx 
9 k.
Finally, at 75% deflection, the current in the circuit will be I  0.750
mA, resulting in a total circuit resistance of 12 k. Therefore, for 75%
deflection, the unknown resistance is Rx  3 k.
The resulting ohmmeter scale appears as shown in Figure 5–49(b).

rent in each circuit. If an ammeter having an internal resistance of 250  is

are different, we will find that the results for both software packages are
equivalent.
Electronics Workbench
The following example will build upon the skills that you learned in the pre-
vious chapter. Just as in the lab, you will measure voltage by connecting
voltmeters across the component(s) under test. Current is measured by plac-

Open Electronics Workbench and construct the above circuit. If

that your circuit will need to have a circuit ground as found in the Sources
parts bin. Once your circuit resembles the circuit shown in Figure 5–52, insert
the ammeters and the voltmeters into the circuit as shown in Figure 5–53.

PSpice
While PSpice has some differences compared to Electronics Workbench, we
find that there are also many similarities. The following example shows how
to use PSpice to analyze the previous circuit. In this example, you will use
the Voltage Differential tool (one of three markers) to find the voltage across
various components in a circuit. If necessary, refer to Appendix A to find the
Voltage Differential tool. You may wish to experiment with other markers,
namely the Voltage Level marker (which indicates voltage with respect to
ground) and the Current Into Pin marker.
Section 5.13 I Circuit Analysis Using Computers
161
Notice that an extra ammeter is placed into the circuit. The only reason for
this is to show that the current is the same everywhere in a series circuit.
Once all ammeters and voltmeters are inserted with the correct polarities,
you may run the simulator by moving the toggle switch to the ON position.
Your indicators should show the same readings as the values shown in Figure
5–53. If any of the values indicated by the meters are negative, you will need to
disconnect the meter(s) and reverse the terminals by using the Ctrl R function.
Although this example is very simple, it illustrates some very important
points that you will find useful when simulating circuit operation.
1. All voltmeters are connected across the components for which we are try-
ing to measure the voltage drop.
2. All ammeters are connected in series with the components through which
we are trying to find the current.
3. A ground symbol (or reference point) is required by all circuits that are to
be simulated by Electronics Workbench.

• Open the CIS Demo software.
• Once you are in the Capture session frame, click on the menu item File,
select New, and then click on Project.
• In the New Project box, type Ch 5 PSpice 1 in the Name text box. Ensure
that the Analog or Mixed-Signal Circuit Wizard is activated.
• You will need to add libraries for your project. Select the breakout.olb, and
eval.olb libraries. Click Finish.

• You should now be in the Capture schematic editor page. Click anywhere to
activate it. Build the circuit as shown in Figure 5–54. Remember to rotate the
components to provide for the correct node assignments. Change the compo-
nent values as required. Remember you will need to change the properties of
the IPRINT symbol by going into the Properties Editor and typing yes into
the DC cell. (Otherwise, you will not get a printout of current.)
• Click the New Simulation Profile icon and enter a name (e.g., Figure 5–54)
in the Name text box. You will need to enter the appropriate settings for
this project in the Simulation Setting box. Click the Analysis tab, and select
DC Sweep from the Analysis type list. For this example, we are using a
constant circuit voltage. Under Sweep variable, select Voltage source, and
type V1 in the Name text box. In the Sweep type box, select Linear.

Finally, type 24V in the Start value text box, 24V in the End value text box,
and 1V in the Increment text box. Click OK and save the document.
• Click on the run icon. You will see a graph of resistor voltages as a function
of the source voltage. Since the voltage supply is constant resistor voltages
are given for a supply voltage of 24 V only. From the graph, we have the
following:

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
Y
ou are part of a research team in the electrical metering department of a
chemical processing plant. As part of your work, you regularly measure
voltages between 100 V and 200 V. The only voltmeter available to you today
has voltage ranges of 20 V, 50 V and 100 V. Clearly, you cannot safely use the
voltmeter to measure the expected voltages. However, after examining the
meter, you notice that the meter movement has a resistance of Rm  2 k and
a sensitivity, S  20 k/V. You realize that the 100-V range can be converted
to a 200-V range by adding a series resistor into the circuit. (Naturally, you
would take extra precautions when measuring these voltages.) Without chang-
ing the internal design of the meter, calculate the value of the series resistor
that you would add to the meter. Show the schematic of the design for your
modified meter. In your design show the meter and series resistances of the
voltmeter as well as the additional resistor that you have added externally.

wo fundamental circuits form the basis of all electrical circuits. They are the
series circuit and the parallel circuit. The previous chapter examined the prin-
ciples and rules which applies to series circuits. In this chapter we study theparallel
(or shunt) circuit and examine the rules governing the operation of these circuits.
Figure 6–1 illustrates a simple example of several light bulbs connected in
parallel with one another and a battery supplying voltage to the bulbs.
This illustration shows one of the important differences between the series
circuit and the parallel circuit. The parallel circuit will continue to operate even
though one of the light bulbs may have a defective (open) filament. Only the
defective light bulb will no longer glow. If a circuit were made up of several
light bulbs in series, however, the defective light bulb would prevent any current
in the circuit, and so all the light bulbs would be off.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Luigi Galvani and the Discovery of Nerve Excitation
LUIGI GALVANI WAS BORN IN BOLOGNA, Italy, on September 9, 1737.
Galvani’s main expertise was in anatomy, a subject in which he was
appointed lecturer at the university in Bologna.
Galvani discovered that when the nerves of frogs were connected to sources
of electricity, the muscles twitched. Although he was unable to determine where
the electrical pulses originated within the animal, Galvani’s work was significant
and helped to open further discoveries in nerve impulses.
Galvani’s name has been adopted for the instrument called the galvanome-
ter, which is used for detecting very small currents.
Luigi Galvani died in Bologna on December 4, 1798. Although he made
many contributions to science, Galvani died poor and surrounded by contro-
versy.

Parallel Circuits
The illustration of Figure 6–1 shows that one terminal of each light bulb is
connected to the positive terminal of the battery and that the other terminal
of the light bulb is connected to the negative terminal of the battery. These
points of connection are often referred to as nodes.
Elements or branches are said to be in a parallel connection when they
have exactly two nodes in common.
Figure 6–2 shows several different ways of sketching parallel elements.
The elements between the nodes may be any two-terminal devices such as
voltage sources, resistors, light bulbs, and the like.

Parallel elements.
In the illustrations of Figure 6–2, notice that every element has two ter-
minals and that each of the terminals is connected to one of the two nodes.
Very often, circuits contain a combination of series and parallel compo-
nents. Although we will study these circuits in greater depth in later chap-
ters, it is important at this point to be able to recognize the various connec-
tions in a given network. Consider the networks shown in Figure 6–3.
When analyzing a particular circuit, it is usually easiest to first designate
the nodes (we will use lowercase letters) and then to identify the types of
connections. Figure 6–4 shows the nodes for the networks of Figure 6–3.

In the circuit of Figure 6–4(a), we see that element B is in parallel with
element C since they each have nodes b and c in common. This parallel com-
bination is now seen to be in series with element A.
In the circuit of Figure 6–4(b), element B is in series with element C
since these elements have a single common node: node b. The branch con-
sisting of the series combination of elements B and C is then determined to

Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Recall that Kirchhoff’s voltage law was extremely useful in understanding
the operation of the series circuit. In a similar manner, Kirchhoff’s current
law is the underlying principle which is used to explain the operation of a
parallel circuit. Kirchhoff’s current law states the following:
The summation of currents entering a node is equal to the summation of
currents leaving the node.
An analogy which helps us understand the principle of Kirchhoff’s cur-
rent law is the flow of water. When water flows in a closed pipe, the amount
of water entering a particular point in the pipe is exactly equal to the amount
of water leaving, since there is no loss. In mathematical form, Kirchhoff’s
current law is stated as follows:
 Ientering node   Ileaving node
(6–1)
Figure 6–5 is an illustration of Kirchhoff’s current law. Here we see that
the node has two currents entering, I1  5 A and I5  3 A, and three currents
leaving, I2  2 A, I3  4 A, and I4  2 A. Now we can see that Equation 6–1
applies in the illustration, namely.

Quite often, when we analyze a given circuit, we are unsure of the direc-
tion of current through a particular element within the circuit. In such cases,
we assume a reference direction and base further calculations on this

assumption. If our assumption is incorrect, calculations will show that the
current has a negative sign. The negative sign simply indicates that the cur-
rent is in fact opposite to the direction selected as the reference. The follow-
ing example illustrates this very important concept.

Chapter 6 I Parallel Circuits
EXAMPLE 6–1
Determine the magnitude and correct direction of the cur-
rents I3 and I5 for the network of Figure 6–7.
Solution
Although points a and b are in fact the same node, we treat the
points as two separate nodes with 0  resistance between them.
Since Kirchhoff’s current law must be valid at point a, we have the fol-
lowing expression for this node:
I1  I2  I3
and so
I3  I1  I2
 2 A  3 A  1 A
Notice that the reference direction of current I3 was taken to be from a to b,
while the negative sign indicates that the current is in fact from b to a.
Similarly, using Kirchhoff’s current law at point b gives
I3  I4  I5
which gives current I5 as
I5  I3  I4
 1 A  6 A  7 A
The negative sign indicates that the current I5 is actually towards node b
rather than away from the node. The actual directions and magnitudes of the
currents are illustrated in Figure 6–8.

Find the magnitudes of the unknown currents for the cir-

Solution
If we consider point a, we see that there are two unknown cur-
rents, I1 and I3. Since there is no way to solve for these values, we examine
the currents at point b, where we again have two unknown currents, I3 and I4.
Finally we observe that at point c there is only one unknown, I4. Using Kirch-
hoff’s current law we solve for the unknown current as follows:
I4  3 A  2 A  10 A
Therefore,
I4  10 A  3 A  2 A  5 A
Now we can see that at point b the current entering is
I3  5 A  3 A  2 A  10 A

Chapter 6 I Parallel Circuits
Solution
We first assume reference directions for the unknown currents in
the network.
Since we may use the analogy of water moving through conduits, we can
easily assign directions for the currents I3, I5, and I7. However, the direction
for the current I4 is not as easily determined, so we arbitrarily assume that its
direction is to the right. Figure 6–10(b) shows the various nodes and the
assumed current directions.
By examining the network, we see that there is only a single source of
current I1  24 A. Using the analogy of water pipes, we conclude that the
current leaving the network is I7  I1  24 A.
Now, applying Kirchhoff’s current law to node a, we calculate the cur-
rent I3 as follows:
I1  I2  I3
Therefore,
I3  I1  I2  24 A  11 A  13 A
Similarly, at node c, we have
I3  I4  I6
Therefore,
I4  I6  I3  6 A  13 A  7 A
Although the current I4 is opposite to the assumed reference direction, we do
not change its direction for further calculations. We use the original direction
together with the negative sign; otherwise the calculations would be need-
lessly complicated.
Applying Kirchhoff’s current law at node b, we get
I2  I4  I5
which gives
I5  I2  I4  11 A  (7 A)  18 A
Finally, applying Kirchhoff’s current law at node d gives
I5  I6  I7

The voltage source will result in current from the positive terminal of
the source toward node a. At this point the current will split between the var-
ious resistors and then recombine at node b before continuing to the negative
terminal of the voltage source.
This circuit illustrates a very important concept of parallel circuits. If we
were to apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop in the paral-
lel circuit of Figure 6–12, we would find that the voltage across all parallel
resistors is exactly equal, namely VR1  VR2  VR3  E. Therefore, by apply-
ing Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we make the following statement:
The voltage across all parallel elements in a circuit will be the same.
The above principle allows us to determine the equivalent resistance, RT,
of any number of resistors connected in parallel. The equivalent resistance,
RT, is the effective resistance “seen” by the source and determines the total
current, IT, provided to the circuit. Applying Kirchhoff’s current law to the
circuit of Figure 6–11, we have the following expression:
IT  I1  I2  …  In

PROBLEMS 2

However, since Kirchhoff’s voltage law also applies to the parallel cir-

and the equivalent resistance, may now be written as

Voltage Sources in Parallel
Voltage sources of different potentials should never be connected in paral-
lel, since to do so would contradict Kirchhoff’s voltage law. However, when
two equal potential sources are connected in parallel, each source will
deliver half the required circuit current. For this reason automobile batteries
are sometimes connected in parallel to assist in starting a car with a “weak”
battery. Figure 6–22 illustrates this principle.
Figure 6–23 shows that if voltage sources of two different potentials are
placed in parallel, Kirchhoff’s voltage law would be violated around the
closed loop. In practice, if voltage sources of different potentials are placed
in parallel, the resulting closed loop can have a very large current. The cur-
rent will occur even though there may not be a load connected across the

Current Divider Rule
When we examined series circuits we determined that the current in the series
circuit was the same everywhere in the circuit, whereas the voltages across the
series elements were typically different. The voltage divider rule (VDR) was
used to determine the voltage across all resistors within a series network.
In parallel networks, the voltage across all parallel elements is the same.
However, the currents through the various elements are typically different.
The current divider rule (CDR) is used to determine how current entering a
node is split between the various parallel resistors connected to the node.
Consider the network of parallel resistors shown in Figure 6–25.

The current divider rule allows us to calculate the current in any resistor
of a parallel network if we know the total current entering the network.
Notice the similarity between the voltage divider rule (for series compo-
nents) and the current divider rule (for parallel components). The main dif-
ference is that the current divider rule of Equation 6–11 uses circuit conduc-
tance rather than resistance. While this equation is useful, it is generally
easier to use resistance to calculate current.
If the network consists of only two parallel resistors, then the current
through each resistor may be found in a slightly different way. Recall that for
two resistors in parallel, the total parallel resistance is given as

Several other important characteristics of parallel networks become evi-
dent.
If current enters a parallel network consisting of any number of equal
resistors, then the current entering the network will split equally between all
of the resistors.
If current enters a parallel network consisting of several values of resis-
tance, then the smallest value of resistor in the network will have the largest
amount of current. Inversely, the largest value of resistance will have the
smallest amount of current.
This characteristic may be simplified by saying that most of the current
will follow the path of least resistance.

Determine the resistance R1 so that current will divide as

Solution
There are several methods which may be used to solve this prob-
lem. We will examine only two of the possibilities.
Method I: Since we have two resistors in parallel, we may use Equation 6–

Method II: By applying Kirchhoff’s current law, we see that the current in R1
must be

Now, since elements in parallel must have the same voltage across their ter-
minals, the voltage across R1 must be exactly the same as the voltage across
R2. By Ohm’s law, the voltage across R2 is

methods are equally correct, we see that the second method in this example is
less involved.

Ammeter Design
The ammeter (which is used to measure current in a circuit) is a very good
practical application of a parallel circuit. Recall that in order to use the
ammeter correctly, the circuit under test must be opened and the ammeter
inserted between the open terminals. Although you will rarely be required to
design an ammeter, it is important to understand the internal operation of the
ammeter. Once you understand the operation, you will appreciate the limita-
tions of the instrument.
The schematic of a simple ammeter using a PMMC (permanent-magnet,
moving-coil) movement is shown in Figure 6–33.

FIGURE 6–33
Simple ammeter.
Since the PMMC movement is able to handle only very small currents, a
precisely engineered resistance is placed in parallel with the resistance of the
meter movement, Rm. The shunt resistance, Rshunt, ensures that the current
entering the sensitive meter movement is kept below the Ifsd (full-scale
deflection current) of the meter movement.
The ammeter is designed to provide full-scale deflection when the cur-
rent entering the instrument is at the desired range current. The shunt resis-
tance ensures that the excess current bypasses the meter movement. The fol-
lowing example shows how the value of shunt resistance is determined for a
given ammeter.
The voltage across the parallel combination of Rm and Rshunt, when the
meter movement is at its maximum deflection, is determined from Ohm’s
law as
Vm  IfsdRm
From Kirchhoff’s current law, the current through the shunt resistor (at
full-scale deflection) is
Ishunt  Irange  Ifsd

And so, from Ohm’s law, the shunt resistor has a value determined as

Figure 6–35 shows the schematic of a simple multirange ammeter. In
order to have a multirange ammeter, it is necessary to have a different shunt
resistor for each range.

To prevent damaging the sensitive meter movement, the ammeter of Fig-
ure 6–35 uses a “make-before-break” switch. As the name implies, this type
of switch makes contact with the new position before breaking contact with
the previous position. This feature prevents a large current from damaging
the sensitive meter movement while a switch is in transition from one range
to the next.

Voltmeter Loading Effects
In the previous chapter, we observed that a voltmeter is essentially a meter
movement in series with a current-limiting resistance. When a voltmeter is
placed across two terminals to provide a voltage reading, the circuit is
affected in the same manner as if a resistance were placed across the two ter-
minals. The effect is shown in Figure 6–36.
If the resistance of the voltmeter is very large in comparison with the
resistance across which the voltage is to be measured, the meter will indicate
essentially the same voltage which was present before the meter was con-
nected. On the other hand, if the meter has an internal resistance which is

near in value to the resistance across which the measurement is taken, then
the meter will adversely load the circuit, resulting in an erroneous reading.
Generally, if the meter resistance is more than ten times larger than the resis-
tance across which the voltage is taken, then the loading effect is considered
negligible and may be ignored.
In the circuit of Figure 6–37, there is no current in the circuit since the ter-
minals a and b are open circuited. The voltage appearing between the open
terminals must be Vab  10 V. Now, if we place a voltmeter having an internal
resistance of 200 k between the terminals, the circuit is closed, resulting in a
small current. The complete circuit appears as shown in Figure 6–38.

when taking measurements in electronic circuits. When an inexperienced
technician or technologist obtains an unforeseen result, he or she assumes
that something is wrong with either the circuit or the instrument. In fact,
both the circuit and the instrument are behaving in a perfectly predictable
manner. The tech merely forgot to take into account the meter’s loading
effect. All instruments have limitations and we must always be aware of
these limitations.

ost circuits encountered in electronics are neither simple series circuits
nor simple parallel circuits, but rather a combination of the two. Although
series-parallel circuits appear to be more complicated than either of the previous
types of circuits analyzed to this point, we find that the same principles apply.
This chapter examines how Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws are applied
to the analysis of series-parallel circuits. We will also observe that voltage and
current divider rules apply to the more complex circuits. In the analysis of
series-parallel circuits, we often simplify the given circuit to enable us to more
clearly see how the rules and laws of circuit analysis apply. Students are encour-
aged to redraw circuits whenever the solution of a problem is not immediately
apparent. This technique is used by even the most experienced engineers, tech-
nologists, and technicians.
In this chapter, we begin by examining simple resistor circuits. The princi-
ples of analysis are then applied to more practical circuits such as those contain-
ing zener diodes and transistors. The same principles are then applied to deter-
mine the loading effects of voltmeters and ammeters in more complex circuits.
After analyzing a complex circuit, we want to know whether the solutions
are in fact correct. As you have already seen, electrical circuits usually may be
studied in more than one way to arrive at a solution. Once currents and voltages
for a circuit have been found, it is very easy to determine whether the resultant
solution verifies the law of conservation of energy, Kirchhoff’s current law, and
Kirchhoff’s voltage law. If there is any discrepancy (other than rounding error),
there is an error in the calculation!

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Benjamin Franklin
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WAS BORN IN BOSTON, Massachusetts, in 1706. Although
Franklin is best known as a great statesman and diplomat, he also furthered the
cause of science with his experiments in electricity. This particularly includes his
work with the Leyden jar, which was used to store electric charge. In his famous
experiment of 1752, he used a kite to demonstrate that lightning is an electrical
event. It was Franklin who postulated that positive and negative electricity are in
fact a single “fluid.”
Although Franklin’s major accomplishments came as a result of his work in
achieving independence of the Thirteen Colonies, he was nonetheless a notable
scientist.
Benjamin Franklin died in his Philadelphia home on February 12, 1790, at
the age of eighty-four.

7.1
The Series-Parallel Network
In electric circuits, we define a branch as any portion of a circuit which can
be simplified as having two terminals. The components between the two ter-
minals may be any combination of resistors, voltage sources, or other ele-
ments. Many complex circuits may be separated into a combination of both
series and/or parallel elements, while other circuits consist of even more
elaborate combinations which are neither series nor parallel.
In order to analyze a complicated circuit, it is important to be able to
recognize which elements are in series and which elements or branches are
in parallel. Consider the network of resistors shown in Figure 7–1.
We immediately recognize that the resistors R2, R3, and R4 are in paral-
lel. This parallel combination is in series with the resistors R1 and R5. The
total resistance may now be written as follows:
RT  R1  (R2R3R4)  R5

Solution
First, we recognize that the resistors R3 and R4 are in parallel:
(R3R4).
Next, we see that this combination is in series with the resistor R2: [R2 
(R3R4)].
Finally, the entire combination is in parallel with the resistor R1. The total
resistance of the circuit may now be written as follows:
RT  R1  [R2  (R3R4)]

7.2
Analysis of Series-Parallel Circuits
Series-parallel networks are often difficult to analyze because they initially
appear confusing. However, the analysis of even the most complex circuit is
simplified by following some fairly basic steps. By practicing (not memoriz-
ing) the techniques outlined in this section, you will find that most circuits
can be reduced to groupings of series and parallel combinations. In analyz-
ing such circuits, it is imperative to remember that the rules for analyzing
series and parallel elements still apply.
The same current occurs through all series elements.
The same voltage occurs across all parallel elements.
In addition, remember that Kirchhoff’s voltage law and Kirchhoff’s cur-
rent law apply for all circuits regardless of whether the circuits are series,
parallel, or series-parallel. The following steps will help to simplify the
analysis of series-parallel circuits:
1. Whenever necessary, redraw complicated circuits showing the source
connection at the left-hand side. All nodes should be labelled to ensure
that the new circuit is equivalent to the original circuit. You will find that
as you become more experienced at analyzing circuits, this step will no
longer be as important and may therefore be omitted.
2. Examine the circuit to determine the strategy which will work best in
analyzing the circuit for the required quantities. You will usually find it
best to begin the analysis of the circuit at the components most distant to
the source.
3. Simplify recognizable combinations of components wherever possible,
redrawing the resulting circuit as often as necessary. Keep the same labels
for corresponding nodes.
4. Determine the equivalent circuit resistance, RT.
5. Solve for the total circuit current. Indicate the directions of all currents
and label the correct polarities of the voltage drops on all components.

6. Calculate how currents and voltages split between the elements of the

7. Since there are usually several possible ways at arriving at solutions, ver-
ify the answers by using a different approach. The extra time taken in this
step will usually ensure that the correct answer has been found.

Solution
We begin by redrawing the circuit in a more simple representation
as shown in Figure 7–8.
From Figure 7–8, we see that the original circuit consists of two parallel
branches, where each branch is a series combination of two resistors.
If we take a moment to examine the circuit, we see that the voltage Vab
may be determined from the combination of voltages across R1 and R2. Alter-
natively, the voltage may be found from the combination of voltages across
R3 and R4.
As usual, several methods of analysis are possible. Because the two
branches are in parallel, the voltage across each branch must be 40 V. Using
the voltage divider rules allows us to quickly calculate the voltage across each
resistor. Although equally correct, other methods of calculating the voltages
would be more lengthy.

Solution
Because the above circuit contains voltage point sources, it is eas-

by drawing a circuit with the reference point as shown in Figure 7–14.

Applications of Series-Parallel Circuits
We now examine how the methods developed in the first two sections of this
chapter are applied when analyzing practical circuits. You may find that
some of the circuits introduce you to unfamiliar devices. For now, you do not
need to know precisely how these devices operate, simply that the voltages
and currents in the circuits follow the same rules and laws that you have
used up to now.

The previous example illustrates how voltages and currents within a
circuit are affected by changes elsewhere in the circuit. In the example, we
saw that the voltage Vab varied from 2 V to 8 V, while the total circuit
current varied from a minimum value of 40 mA to a maximum value
of 42 mA. These changes occurred even though the resistor Rx varied from
0  to .
A transistor is a three-terminal device which may be used to amplify
small signals. In order for the transistor to operate as an amplifier, however,
certain dc conditions must be met. These conditions set the “bias point” of
the transistor. The bias current of a transistor circuit is determined by a dc
voltage source and several resistors. Although the operation of the transistor
is outside the scope of this textbook, we can analyze the bias circuit of a
transistor using elementary circuit theory.

A zener diode is a two-terminal device similar to a varistor (refer to
Chapter 3). When the voltage across the zener diode attempts to go above the
rated voltage for the device, the zener diode provides a low-resistance path
for the extra current. Due to this action, a relatively constant voltage, VZ, is
maintained across the zener diode. This characteristic is referred to as volt-
age regulation and has many applications in electronic and electrical cir-
cuits. Once again, although the theory of operation of the zener diode is out-
side the scope of this textbook, we are able to apply simple circuit theory to
examine how the circuit operates.

Chapter 7 I Series-Parallel Circuits
Solution
If we take a moment to examine the circuit, we see that the zener
diode is placed in parallel with the resistor R2. This parallel combination is in
series with the resistor R1 and the voltage source, E.
In order for the zener diode to operate as a regulator, the voltage across
the diode would have to be above the zener voltage without the diode present.
If we remove the zener diode the circuit would appear as shown in Figure 7–27.
From Figure 7–27, we may determine the voltage V2 which would be
present without the zener diode in the circuit. Since the circuit is a simple
series circuit, the voltage divider rule may be used to determine V2:

When the zener diode is placed across the resistor R2 the device will operate
to limit the voltage to VZ  5 V.
Because the zener diode is operating as a voltage regulator, the voltage
across both the diode and the resistor R2 must be the same, namely 5 V. The
parallel combination of DZ and R2 is in series with the resistor R1, and so the
voltage across R1 is easily determined from Kirchhoff’s voltage law as

Potentiometers
As mentioned in Chapter 3, variable resistors may be used as potentiometers
as shown in Figure 7–28 to control voltage into another circuit.
The volume control on a receiver or amplifier is an example of a vari-
able resistor used as a potentiometer. When the movable terminal is at the
uppermost position, the voltage appearing between terminals b and c is sim-
ply calculated by using the voltage divider rule as
Vbc 
50 k
50

k
50 k
(120 V)  60 V
Alternatively, when the movable terminal is at the lowermost position,
the voltage between terminals b and c is Vbc  0 V, since the two terminals
are effectively shorted and the voltage across a short circuit is always zero.
The circuit of Figure 7–28 represents a potentiometer having an output
voltage which is adjustable between 0 and 60 V. This output is referred to as
the unloaded output, since there is no load resistance connected between
the terminals b and c. If a load resistance were connected between these ter-
minals, the output voltage, called the loaded output, would no longer be the
same. The following example is an illustration of circuit loading.

Chapter 7 I Series-Parallel Circuits
The maximum voltage Vbc occurs when the movable contact is at the
uppermost contact of the variable resistor. In this position, the circuit may be
represented as shown in Figure 7–30.
In Figure 7–30, we see that the resistance R2 is in parallel with the load
resistor RL. The voltage between terminals b and c is easily determined from

Loading Effects of Instruments
In Chapters 5 and 6 we examined how ammeters and voltmeters affect the
operation of simple series circuits. The degree to which the circuits are
affected is called the loading effect of the instrument. Recall that, in order
for an instrument to provide an accurate indication of how a circuit operates,
the loading effect should ideally be zero. In practice, it is impossible for any
instrument to have zero loading effect, since all instruments absorb some
energy from the circuit under test, thereby affecting circuit operation.
In this section, we will determine how instrument loading affects more
complex circuits.
EXAMPLE 7–11
Calculate the loading effects if a digital multimeter, having
an internal resistance of 10 M, is used to measure V1 and V2 in the circuit of
Figure 7–31.
Solution
In order to determine the loading effect for a particular reading,
we need to calculate both the unloaded voltage and the loaded voltage.
For the circuit given in Figure 7–31, the unloaded voltage across each
resistor is

When the voltmeter is used to measure V1, the result is equivalent to connect-

This example clearly illustrates a problem that novices often make when
they are taking voltage measurements in high-resistance circuits. If the mea-
sured voltages V1  6.75 V and V2  13.50 V are used to verify Kirchhoff’s
voltage law, the novice would say that this represents a contradiction of the
law (since 6.75 V  13.50 V  27.0 V). In fact, we see that the circuit is
behaving exactly as predicted by circuit theory. The problem occurs when
instrument limitations are not considered.

For the circuit of Figure 7–34, calculate the loading effect

Notice that the loading effect for an ammeter is most pronounced when it is
used to measure current in a branch having a resistance in the same order of
magnitude as the meter.
You will also notice that if this ammeter were used in a circuit to verify
the correctness of Kirchhoff’s current law, the loading effect of the meter
would produce an apparent contradiction. From KCL,
IT  I1  I2
By substituting the measured values of current into the above equation, we
have
10.91 mA  3.33 mA  10.0 mA
10.91 mA  13.33 mA (contradiction)
This example illustrates that the loading effect of a meter may severely affect
the current in a circuit, giving results which seem to contradict the laws of
circuit theory. Therefore, wherever an instrument is used to measure a partic-
ular quantity, we must always take into account the limitations of the instru-
ment and question the validity of a resulting reading.

1. We begin by constructing the circuit as shown in Figure 7–42. The poten-
tiometer is selected from the Basic button on the Parts bin toolbar. Ensure
that the potentiometer is inserted as illustrated.
2. Double click on the potentiometer symbol and change its value to 50 k.
Notice that the increment value is set for 5%. Adjust this value so that it is
at 10%. We will use this in a following step.
3. Once the circuit is completely built, the power switch is turned on. Notice
that the resistor value is at 50%. This means that the potentiometer is
adjusted so that its value is 25 k The following step will change the
value of the potentiometer to 0 .
4. Double click on the potentiometer symbol. The value of the resistor is now
easily changed by either Shift R (to incrementally increase the value) or R
(to incrementally decrease the value). As you decrease the value of the
potentiometer, you should observe that the voltage displayed on the multi-
meter is also changing. It takes a few seconds for the display to stabilize.
As shown in Figure 7–42, you should observe that I  42.0 mA and Vab 
8.00 V when Rx  0 .
5. Finally, after adjusting the value of the potentiometer, we obtain the fol-
lowing readings:
Rx  15 k (30%):
I  40.5 mA and Vab  0.500 V
Rx  50 k (100%):

necessary set the parameters of the circuit to sweep through a range of val-
ues. The following example illustrates the method used to provide a graphi-
cal display of output voltage and source current for a range of resistance.
Although the method is different, the results are consistent with those of the

• Double click on the component value for R4. Enter {Rx} in the Value text

to evaluate the parameter and use its value.
• Click on the Place part tool. Select the Special library and click on the

• Click on the New Simulation icon and give the simulation a name such as
Fig 7–43.
• In the Simulation Settings, select the Analysis Tab. The Analysis type is

variable box select Global Parameter. Type Rx in the Parameter name text
box. Select the Sweep type to be linear and set the limits as follows:
Start value: 100
End value: 50k
Increment: 100.
These settings will change the resistor value from 100  to 50 k in
100- increments. Click OK.
• Click on the Run icon. You will see a blank screen with the abscissa (hori-
zontal axis) showing Rx scaled from 0 to 50 k.
• PSpice is able to plot most circuit variables as a function of Rx. In order to
request a plot of Vab, click on Trace and Add Trace. Enter V(R3:1) 
V(R4:1) in the Trace Expression text box. The voltage Vab is the voltage
between node 1 of R3 and node 1 of R4. Click OK.
• Finally, to obtain a plot of the circuit current I (current through the voltage
source), we need to first add an extra axis. Click on Plot and then click Add
Y Axis. To obtain a plot of the current, click on Trace and Add Trace.
Select I(V1). The resulting display on the monitor is shown in Figure 7–44.

ery often manufacturers provide schematics showing the dc voltages that
one would expect to measure if the circuit were functioning properly.
The following figure shows part of a schematic for an amplifier circuit.
PROBLEMS
Even though a schematic may include components with which the reader
is not familiar, the dc voltages provided on the schematic enable us to deter-
mine voltages and current in various parts of the circuit. If the circuit is
faulty, measured voltages and currents will be different from the theoretical,
allowing the experience troubleshooter to locate the fault.
Examine the circuit shown. Use the voltage information on the schematic
to determine the theoretical values of the currents I1, I2, I3, I4, and I5. Find the
magnitude and correct polarity of the voltage across the device labeled as C2.

he networks you have worked with so far have generally had a single volt-
age source and could be easily analyzed using techniques such as Kirch-
hoff’s voltage law and Kirchhoff’s current law. In this chapter, you will examine
circuits which have more than one voltage source or which cannot be easily ana-
lyzed using techniques studied in previous chapters.
The methods used in determining the operation of complex networks will
include branch-current analysis, mesh (or loop) analysis, and nodal analysis.
Although any of the above methods may be used, you will find that certain cir-
cuits are more easily analyzed using one particular approach. The advantages of
each method will be discussed in the appropriate section.
In using the techniques outlined above, it is assumed that the networks are
linear bilateral networks. The term linear indicates that the components used
in the circuit have voltage-current characteristics which follow a straight line.
Refer to Figure 8–1.
The term bilateral indicates that the components in the network will have
characteristics which are independent of the direction of the current through the
element or the voltage across the element. A resistor is an example of a linear
bilateral component since the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to
the current through it and the operation of the resistor is the same regardless of
the direction of the current.
In this chapter you will be introduced to the conversion of a network from a
delta () configuration to an equivalent wye (Y) configuration. Conversely, we
will examine the transformation from a Y configuration to an equivalent  con-
figuration. You will use these conversions to examine the operation of an unbal-
anced bridge network.

Sir Charles Wheatstone
CHARLES WHEATSTONE WAS BORN IN GLOUCESTER, England, on February 6,
1802. Wheatstone’s original interest was in the study of acoustics and musical
instruments. However, he gained fame and a knighthood as a result of inventing
the telegraph and improving the electric generator.
Although he did not invent the bridge circuit, Wheatstone used one for mea-
suring resistance very precisely. He found that when the currents in the Wheat-
stone bridge are exactly balanced, the unknown resistance can be compared to a
known standard.
Sir Charles died in Paris, France, on October 19, 1875.
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE

8.1
Constant-Current Sources
All the circuits presented so far have used voltage sources as the means of
providing power. However, the analysis of certain circuits is easier if you
work with current rather than with voltage. Unlike a voltage source, a con-
stant-current source maintains the same current in its branch of the circuit
regardless of how components are connected external to the source. The
symbol for a constant-current source is shown in Figure 8–2.
The direction of the current source arrow indicates the direction of con-
ventional current in the branch. In previous chapters you learned that the
magnitude and the direction of current through a voltage source varies
according to the size of the circuit resistances and how other voltage sources
are connected in the circuit. For current sources, the voltage across the cur-
rent source depends on how the other components are connected.

a. Calculate the voltage VS across the current source if the resistor is 100 .
b. Calculate the voltage if the resistor is 2 k.

circuit. Therefore,
a. VS  VR  (2 A)(100 )  200 V.
b. VS  VR  (2 A)(2 k)  4000 V.
If the current source is the only source in the circuit, then the polarity of
voltage across the source will be as shown in Figure 8–3. This, however,
may not be the case if there is more than one source. The following example
illustrates this principle.

EXAMPLE 8–2
Determine the voltages V1, V2, and VS and the current IS for
the circuit of Figure 8–4.
Solution
Since the given circuit is a series circuit, the current everywhere in
the circuit must be the same, namely
IS  2 mA
Using Ohm’s law,
V1  (2 mA)(1 k)  2.00 V
V2  (2 mA)(2 k)  4.00 V

assumed.

If the internal resistance of a source is considered, the source, whether it
is a voltage source or a current source, is easily converted to the other type.
The current source of Figure 8–6 is equivalent to the voltage source if

and the resistance in both sources is RS.
By examining the previous examples, the following conclusions may be
made regarding current sources:
The constant-current source determines the current in its branch of the
circuit.
The magnitude and polarity of voltage appearing across a constant-cur-
rent source are dependent upon the network in which the source is connected.
8.2
Source Conversions
In the previous section you were introduced to the ideal constant-current
source. This is a source which has no internal resistance included as part of
the circuit. As you recall, voltage sources always have some series resis-
tance, although in some cases this resistance is so small in comparison with
other circuit resistance that it may effectively be ignored when determining
the operation of the circuit. Similarly, a constant-current source will always
have some shunt (or parallel) resistance. If this resistance is very large in
comparison with the other circuit resistance, the internal resistance of the
source may once again be ignored. An ideal current source has an infinite
shunt resistance.
Figure 8–6 shows equivalent voltage and current sources.

Similarly, a current source may be converted to an equivalent voltage

(8–2)
These results may be easily verified by connecting an external resis-
tance, RL, across each source. The sources can be equivalent only if the volt-
age across RL is the same for both sources. Similarly, the sources are equiva-
lent only if the current through RL is the same when connected to either
source.

Current Sources in Parallel and Series
When several current sources are placed in parallel, the circuit may be sim-
plified by combining the current sources into a single current source. The
magnitude and direction of this resultant source is determined by adding the
currents in one direction and then subtracting the currents in the opposite
direction.

Since all of the current sources are in parallel, they can be
replaced by a single current source. The equivalent current source will have a
direction which is the same as both I2 and I3, since the magnitude of current in
the downward direction is greater than the current in the upward direction.

Current sources should never be placed in series. If a node is chosen
between the current sources, it becomes immediately apparent that the cur-
rent entering the node is not the same as the current leaving the node.
Clearly, this cannot occur since there would then be a violation of Kirch-
hoff’s current law (see Figure 8–17).

Branch-Current Analysis
In previous chapters we used Kirchhoff’s circuit law and Kirchhoff’s voltage
law to solve equations for circuits having a single voltage source. In this sec-
tion, you will use these powerful tools to analyze circuits having more than
one source.
Branch-current analysis allows us to directly calculate the current in
each branch of a circuit. Since the method involves the analysis of several
simultaneous linear equations, you may find that a review of determinants is
in order. Appendix B has been included to provide a review of the mechanics
of solving simultaneous linear equations.
When applying branch-current analysis, you will find the technique
listed below useful.
1. Arbitrarily assign current directions to each branch in the network. If a
particular branch has a current source, then this step is not necessary
since you already know the magnitude and direction of the current in this
branch.
2. Using the assigned currents, label the polarities of the voltage drops
across all resistors in the circuit.
3. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each of the closed loops. Write just
enough equations to include all branches in the loop equations. If a
branch has only a current source and no series resistance, it is not neces-
sary to include it in the KVL equations.

4. Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at enough nodes to ensure that all branch
currents have been included. In the event that a branch has only a current
source, it will need to be included in this step.
5. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations.
276
Chapter 8 I Methods of Analysis
EXAMPLE 8–8
Find the current in each branch in the circuit of Figure 8–18.
Solution
Step 1: Assign currents as shown in Figure 8–18.
Step 2: Indicate the polarities of the voltage drops on all resistors in the cir-
cuit, using the assumed current directions.
Step 3: Write the Kirchhoff voltage law equations.
Loop abcda:
6 V  (2 )I1  (2 )I2  4 V  0 V
Notice that the circuit still has one branch which has not been included in the
KVL equations, namely the branch cefd. This branch would be included if a
loop equation for cefdc or for abcefda were written. There is no reason for
choosing one loop over another, since the overall result will remain
unchanged even though the intermediate steps will not give the same results.
Loop cefdc:
4 V  (2 )I2  (4 )I3  2 V  0 V
Now that all branches have been included in the loop equations, there is no
need to write any more. Although more loops exist, writing more loop equa-
tions would needlessly complicate the calculations.
Step 4: Write the Kirchhoff current law equation(s).
By applying KCL at node c, all branch currents in the network are included.
Node c:
I3  I1  I2

Find the currents in each branch of the circuit shown in

Solution
Notice that although the above circuit has four currents, there are
only three unknown currents: I2, I3, and I4. The current I1 is given by the
value of the constant-current source. In order to solve this network we will
need three linear equations. As before, the equations are determined by
Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws.
Step 1: The currents are indicated in the given circuit.
Step 2: The polarities of the voltages across all resistors are shown.
Step 3: Kirchhoff’s voltage law is applied at the indicated loops:

Mesh (Loop) Analysis
In the previous section you used Kirchhoff’s laws to solve for the current in
each branch of a given network. While the methods used were relatively sim-
ple, branch-current analysis is awkward to use because it generally involves
solving several simultaneous linear equations. It is not difficult to see that
the number of equations may be prohibitively large even for a relatively sim-
ple circuit.
A better approach and one which is used extensively in analyzing linear
bilateral networks is called mesh (or loop) analysis. While the technique is
similar to branch-current analysis, the number of simultaneous linear equa-
tions tends to be less. The principal difference between mesh analysis and
branch-current analysis is that we simply need to apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law around closed loops without the need for applying Kirchhoff’s current
law.
The steps used in solving a circuit using mesh analysis are as follows:
1. Arbitrarily assign a clockwise current to each interior closed loop in the
network. Although the assigned current may be in any direction, a clock-
wise direction is used to make later work simpler.
2. Using the assigned loop currents, indicate the voltage polarities across all
resistors in the circuit. For a resistor which is common to two loops, the
polarities of the voltage drop due to each loop current should be indicated
on the appropriate side of the component.
3. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law, write the loop equations for each loop
in the network. Do not forget that resistors which are common to two
loops will have two voltage drops, one due to each loop.
4. Solve the resultant simultaneous linear equations.
5. Branch currents are determined by algebraically combining the loop cur-
rents which are common to the branch.

EXAMPLE 8–10

If the circuit being analyzed contains current sources, the procedure is a
bit more complicated. The circuit may be simplified by converting the cur-
rent source(s) to voltage sources and then solving the resulting network
using the procedure shown in the previous example. Alternatively, you may
Section 8.5 I Mesh (Loop) Analysis
281
Step 2: Voltage polarities are assigned according to the loop currents. Notice
that the resistor R2 has two different voltage polarities due to the different
loop currents.
Step 3: The loop equations are written by applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law in
each of the loops. The equations are as follows:
Loop 1:
6 V  (2 )I1  (2 )I1  (2 )I2  4 V  0
Loop 2:
4 V  (2 )I2  (2 )I1  (4 )I2  2 V  0
Note that the voltage across R2 due to the currents I1 and I2 is indicated as two
separated terms, where one term represents a voltage drop in the direction of
I1 and the other term represents a voltage rise in the same direction. The mag-
nitude and polarity of the voltage across R2 is determined by the actual size
and directions of the loop currents. The above loop equations may be simpli-
fied as follows:
Loop 1:
(4 )I1  (2 )I2  2 V
Loop 2:
(2 )I1  (6 )I2  6 V

are I1 and I2 respectively.

through this resistor:

The results obtained by using mesh analysis are exactly the same as those
obtained by branch-current analysis. Whereas branch-current analysis
required three equations, this approach requires the solution of only two
simultaneous linear equations. Mesh analysis also requires that only Kirch-
hoff’s voltage law be applied and clearly illustrates why mesh analysis is pre-
ferred to branch-current analysis.

Format Approach for Mesh Analysis
A very simple technique may be used to write the mesh equations for any lin-
ear bilateral network. When this format approach is used, the simultaneous
linear equations for a network having n independent loops will appear as
follows:
R11I1  R12I2  R13I3  …  R1nIn  E1

Rn1I1  Rn2I2  Rn3I3  …  RnnIn  En
The terms R11, R22, R33, . . . , Rnn represent the total resistance in each
loop and are found by simply adding all the resistances in a particular loop.
The remaining resistance terms are called the mutual resistance terms.
These resistances represent resistance which is shared between two loops.
For example, the mutual resistance R12 is the resistance in loop 1 which is

located in the branch between loop 1 and loop 2. If there is no resistance
between two loops, this term will be zero.
The terms containing R11, R22, R33, . . . , Rnn are positive, and all of the
mutual resistance terms are negative. This characteristic occurs because all
currents are assumed to be clockwise.
If the linear equations are correctly written, you will find that the coeffi-
cients along the principal diagonal (R11, R22, R33, . . . , Rnn) will be positive.
All other coefficients will be negative. Also, if the equations are correctly
written, the terms will be symmetrical about the principal diagonal, e.g.,
R12  R21.
The terms E1, E2, E3, . . . , En are the summation of the voltage rises in
the direction of the loop currents. If a voltage source appears in the branch
shared by two loops, it will be included in the calculation of the voltage rise
for each loop.
The method used in applying the format approach of mesh analysis is as
follows:
1. Convert current sources into equivalent voltage sources.
2. Assign clockwise currents to each independent closed loop in the net-
work.
3. Write the simultaneous linear equations in the format outlined.
4. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations.

Solve for the currents through R2 and R3 in the circuit of
Figure 8–26.
Solution
Step 1: Although we see that the circuit has a current source, it may not be
immediately evident how the source can be converted into an equivalent volt-
age source. Redrawing the circuit into a more recognizable form, as shown in
Figure 8–27, we see that the 2-mA current source is in parallel with a 6-k
resistor. The source conversion is also illustrated in Figure 8–27.

Step 2: Redrawing the circuit is further simplified by labelling some of the
nodes, in this case a and b. After performing a source conversion, we have the

also illustrated.

Step 4: In order to simplify the solution of the previous linear equations, we
may eliminate the units (k and V) from our calculations. By inspection,
we see that the units for current must be in milliamps. Using determinants, we
solve for the currents I1 and I2 as follows:

The current through resistor R2 is easily determined to be
I2  I1  0.644 mA  (0.894 mA)  1.54 mA
The current through R3 is not found as easily. A common mistake is to say that
the current in R3 is the same as the current through the 6-k resistor of the cir-
cuit in Figure 8–28. This is not the case. Since this resistor was part of the
source conversion it is no longer in the same location as in the original circuit.
Although there are several ways of finding the required current, the
method used here is the application of Ohm’s law. If we examine Figure
8–26, we see that the voltage across R3 is equal to Vab. From Figure 8–28, we
see that we determine Vab by using the calculated value of I1.
Vab  (6 k)I1  12 V  (6 k)(0.894 mA)  12 V  6.64 V

point a is negative with respect to point b). The current has a value of

Nodal Analysis
In the previous section we applied Kirchhoff’s voltage law to arrive at loop
currents in a network. In this section we will apply Kirchhoff’s current law
to determine the potential difference (voltage) at any node with respect to
some arbitrary reference point in a network. Once the potentials of all nodes
are known, it is a simple matter to determine other quantities such as current
and power within the network.
The steps used in solving a circuit using nodal analysis are as follows:
1. Arbitrarily assign a reference node within the circuit and indicate this
node as ground. The reference node is usually located at the bottom of
the circuit, although it may be located anywhere.
2. Convert each voltage source in the network to its equivalent current
source. This step, although not absolutely necessary, makes further calcu-
lations easier to understand.
3. Arbitrarily assign voltages (V1, V2, . . . , Vn) to the remaining nodes in
the circuit. (Remember that you have already assigned a reference node,
so these voltages will all be with respect to the chosen reference.)
4. Arbitrarily assign a current direction to each branch in which there is no
current source. Using the assigned current directions, indicate the corre-
sponding polarities of the voltage drops on all resistors.
5. With the exception of the reference node (ground), apply Kirchhoff’s cur-
rent law at each of the nodes. If a circuit has a total of n  1 nodes (includ-
ing the reference node), there will be n simultaneous linear equations.
6. Rewrite each of the arbitrarily assigned currents in terms of the potential
difference across a known resistance.
7. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations for the voltages (V1, V2,
. . . , Vn).

In the previous two examples, you may have noticed that the simultaneous
linear equations have a format similar to that developed for mesh analysis.
When we wrote the nodal equation for node V1 the coefficient for the vari-
able V1 was positive, and it had a magnitude given by the summation of the
conductance attached to this node. The coefficient for the variable V2 was
negative and had a magnitude given by the mutual conductance between
nodes V1 and V2.
Format Approach
A simple format approach may be used to write the nodal equations for any
network having n  1 nodes. Where one of these nodes is denoted as the ref-
erence node, there will be n simultaneous linear equations which will appear
as follows:
G11V1  G12V2  G13V3  …  R1nVn  I1
G21V1  G22V2  G23V3  …  R2nVn  I2

Gn1V1  Gn2V2  Gn3V3  …  RnnVn  In
The coefficients (constants) G11, G22, G33, . . . , Gnn represent the sum-
mation of the conductances attached to the particular node. The remaining
coefficients are called the mutual conductance terms. For example, the
mutual conductance G23 is the conductance attached to node V2, which is

common to node V3. If there is no conductance that is common to two nodes,
then this term would be zero. Notice that the terms G11, G22, G33, . . . , Gnn
are positive and that the mutual conductance terms are negative. Further, if
the equations are written correctly, then the terms will be symmetrical about
the principal diagonal, e.g., G23  G32.
The terms V1, V2, . . . , Vn are the unknown node voltages. Each voltage
represents the potential difference between the node in question and the ref-
erence node.
The terms I1, I2, . . . , In are the summation of current sources entering
the node. If a current source has a current such that it is leaving the node,
then the current is simply assigned as negative. If a particular current source
is shared between two nodes, then this current must be included in both
nodal equations.
The method used in applying the format approach of nodal analysis is as
follows:
1. Convert voltage sources into equivalent current sources.
2. Label the reference node as
. Label the remaining nodes as V1, V2, . . . , Vn.
3. Write the linear equation for each node using the format outlined.
4. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations for V1, V2, . . . , Vn.
The next examples illustrate how the format approach is used to solve
circuit problems.

Because it is inconvenient to use kilohms and milliamps throughout our cal-

being “volts.” Therefore the nodal equations may be simplified as

may be analyzed using techniques developed earlier in this chapter, there
is an easier approach. For example, consider the circuit shown in Figure
8–39.
This circuit could be analyzed using mesh analysis. However, you
see that the analysis would involve solving four simultaneous linear
equations, since there are four separate loops in the circuit. If we were
to use nodal analysis, the solution would require determining three node
voltages, since there are three nodes in addition to a reference node. Unless
a computer is used, both techniques are very time-consuming and prone to
error.
As you have already seen, it is occasionally easier to examine a circuit
after it has been converted to some equivalent form. We will now develop a
technique for converting a circuit from a delta (or pi) into an equivalent wye
(or tee) circuit. Consider the circuits shown in Figure 8–40. We start by
making the assumption that the networks shown in Figure 8–40(a) are equiv-
alent to those shown in Figure 8–40(b). Then, using this assumption, we will
determine the mathematical relationships between the various resistors in the
equivalent circuits.
The circuit of Figure 8–40(a) can be equivalent to the circuit of Figure
8–40(b) only if the resistance “seen” between any two terminals is exactly

the same. If we were to connect a source between terminals a and b of the
“Y,” the resistance between the terminals would be

(8–5)
But the resistance between terminals a and b of the “” is

Wye-Delta Conversion
By using Equations 8–11 to 8–13, it is possible to derive another set of
equations which allow the conversion from a “Y” into an equivalent “.”
Examining Equations 8–11 through 8–13, we see that the following must
be true:

ing the sum of all two-product combinations of “Y” resistor values and then
dividing by the resistance in the “Y” which is located directly opposite to the
resistor being calculated.
If the resistors in a Y network are all equal, then the resultant resistors in
the equivalent  circuit will also be equal and given as

As is often the case, the given circuit may be solved in one of
two ways. We may convert the “” into its equivalent “Y,” and solve the cir-
cuit by placing the resultant branches in parallel, or we may convert the “Y”
into its equivalent “.” We choose to use the latter conversion since the
resistors in the “Y” have the same value. The equivalent “” will have all
resistors given as

Bridge Networks
In this section you will be introduced to the bridge network. Bridge net-
works are used in electronic measuring equipment to precisely measure
resistance in dc circuits and similar quantities in ac circuits. The bridge cir-
cuit was originally used by Sir Charles Wheatstone in the mid-nineteenth
century to measure resistance by balancing small currents. The Wheatstone
bridge circuit is still used to measure resistance very precisely. The digital
bridge, shown in Figure 8–47, is an example of one such instrument.

Digital bridge used for precisely measuring resistance, inductance, and
capacitance.
You will use the techniques developed earlier in the chapter to analyze
the operation of these networks. Bridge circuits may be shown in various
configurations as seen in Figure 8–48.
Although a bridge circuit may appear in one of three forms, you can see
that they are equivalent. There are, however, two different states of bridges:
the balanced bridge and the unbalanced bridge.
A balanced bridge is one in which the current through the resistance R5
is equal to zero. In practical circuits, R5 is generally a variable resistor in

From Equation 8–21, we notice that a bridge network is balanced when-
ever the ratios of the resistors in the two arms are the same.

An unbalanced bridge is one in which the current through R5 is not
zero, and so the above ratio does not apply to an unbalanced bridge network.
Figure 8–49 illustrates each condition of a bridge network.

FIGURE 8–49
If a balanced bridge appears as part of a complete circuit, its analysis is
very simple since the resistor R5 may be removed and replaced with either a
short (since VR5  0) or an open (since IR5  0).
However, if a circuit contains an unbalanced bridge, the analysis is more
complicated. In such cases, it is possible to determine currents and voltages
by using mesh analysis, nodal analysis, or by using  to Y conversion. The
following examples illustrate how bridges may be analyzed.
EXAMPLE 8–21
Solve for the currents through R1 and R4 in the circuit of
Figure 8–50.
Solution
We see that the bridge of the above circuit is balanced (since R1/R3 
R2/R4). Because the circuit is balanced, we may remove R5 and replace it with
either a short circuit (since the voltage across a short circuit is zero) or an
open circuit (since the current through an open circuit is zero). The remaining
circuit is then solved by one of the methods developed in previous chapters.
Both methods will be illustrated to show that the results are exactly the same.
Method 1: If R5 is replaced by an open, the result is the circuit shown in Fig-
ure 8–51.

Use mesh analysis to find the currents through R1 and R5

there will always be some current through resistor R5. The unbalanced cir-

A final method for analyzing bridge networks involves the use of  to Y
conversion. The following example illustrates the method used.
EXAMPLE 8–24

By inspection we see that this circuit is not balanced, since

Therefore, the current through R5 cannot be zero. Notice, also, that the circuit
contains two possible  configurations. If we choose to convert the top  to
its equivalent Y, we get the circuit shown in Figure 8–57.

simple series circuit shown in Figure 8–58.
The circuit of Figure 8–58 is easily analyzed to give a total circuit current of

Using the calculated current, it is possible to work back to the original circuit.
The currents in the resistors R3 and R4 are found by using the current divider
rule for the corresponding resistor branches, as shown in Figure 8–57.

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
Electronics Workbench and PSpice are able to analyze a circuit without the
need to convert between voltage and current sources or having to write
lengthy linear equations. It is possible to have the program output the value
of voltage across or current through any element in a given circuit. The fol-
lowing examples were previously analyzed using several other methods
throughout this chapter.

PUTTING IN INTO PRACTICE
S
train gauges are manufactured from very fine wire mounted on insulated
surfaces which are then glued to large metal structures. These instruments
are used by civil engineers to measure the movement and mass of large
objects such as bridges and buildings. When the very fine wire of a strain
gauge is subjected to stress, its effective length is increased (due to stretch-
ing) or decreased (due to compression). This change in length results in a cor-
responding minute change in resistance. By placing one or more strain
gauges into a bridge circuit, it is possible to detect variation in resistance, R.
This change in resistance can be calibrated to correspond to an applied force.
Consequently, it is possible to use such a bridge as a means of measuring
very large masses. Consider that you have two strain gauges mounted in a
bridge as shown in the accompanying figure.
Strain gauge bridge.
The variable resistors, R2 and R4 are strain gauges that are mounted on
opposite sides of a steel girder used to measure very large masses. When a
mass is applied to the girder, the strain gauge on one side of the girder will
compress, reducing the resistance. The strain gauge on the other side of the
girder will stretch, increasing the resistance. When no mass is applied, there
will be neither compression nor stretching and so the bridge will be balanced,
resulting in a voltage Vab  0 V.
Write an expression for R as a function of Vab. Assume that the scale is
calibrated so that resistance variation of R  0.02  corresponds to a mass
of 5000 kg. Determine the measured mass if Vab  4.20 mV.

n this chapter you will learn how to use some basic theorems which will allow
the analysis of even the most complex resistive networks. The theorems
which are most useful in analyzing networks are the superposition, Thévenin,
Norton, and maximum power transfer theorems.
You will also be introduced to other theorems which, while useful for pro-
viding a well-rounded appreciation of circuit analysis, have limited use in the
analysis of circuits. These theorems, which apply to specific types of circuits,
are the substitution, reciprocity, and Millman theorems. Your instructor may
choose to omit the latter theorems without any loss in continuity.

PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
André Marie Ampère
ANDRÉ MARIE AMPÈRE WAS BORN in Polémieux, Rhône, near Lyon, France on
January 22, 1775. As a youth, Ampère was a brilliant mathematician who was
able to master advanced mathematics by the age of twelve. However, the French
Revolution, and the ensuing anarchy which swept through France from 1789 to
1799, did not exclude the Ampère family. Ampère’s father, who was a prominent
merchant and city official in Lyon, was executed under the guillotine in 1793.
Young André suffered a nervous breakdown from which he never fully recov-
ered. His suffering was further compounded in 1804, when after only five years
of marriage, Ampère’s wife died.
Even so, Ampère was able to make profound contributions to the field of
mathematics, chemistry, and physics. As a young man, Ampère was appointed as
professor of chemistry and physics in Bourg. Napoleon was a great supporter of
Ampère’s work, though Ampère had a reputation as an “absent-minded profes-
sor.” Later he moved to Paris, where he taught mathematics.
Ampère showed that two current-carrying wires were attracted to one
another when the current in the wires was in the same direction. When the cur-
rent in the wires was in the opposite direction, the wires repelled. This work set
the stage for the discovery of the principles of electric and magnetic field theory.
Ampère was the first scientist to use electromagnetic principles to measure cur-
rent in a wire. In recognition of his contribution to the study of electricity, cur-
rent is measured in the unit of amperes.
Despite his personal suffering, Ampère remained a popular, friendly human
being. He died of pneumonia in Marseille on June 10, 1836 after a brief illness.

9.1
Superposition Theorem
The superposition theorem is a method which allows us to determine the
current through or the voltage across any resistor or branch in a network.
The advantage of using this approach instead of mesh analysis or nodal
analysis is that it is not necessary to use determinants or matrix algebra to
analyze a given circuit. The theorem states the following:
The total current through or voltage across a resistor or branch may be
determined by summing the effects due to each independent source.
In order to apply the superposition theorem it is necessary to remove all
sources other than the one being examined. In order to “zero” a voltage
source, we replace it with a short circuit, since the voltage across a short
circuit is zero volts. A current source is zeroed by replacing it with an open
circuit, since the current through an open circuit is zero amps.
If we wish to determine the power dissipated by any resistor, we must
first find either the voltage across the resistor or the current through the
resistor:

Chapter 9 I Network Theorems
The superposition theorem does
not apply to power, since power
is not a linear quantity, but
rather is found as the square of
either current or voltage.

Consider the circuit of Figure 9–1:
a. Determine the current in the load resistor, RL.
b. Verify that the superposition theorem does not apply to power.
Solution
a. We first determine the current through RL due to the voltage source by
removing the current source and replacing in with an open circuit (zero
amps) as shown in Figure 9–2.

Chapter 9 I Network Theorems
The resultant current through RL is found by applying the superposition theo-
rem:
IL  0.5 A  1.2 A  0.700 A
The negative sign indicates that the current through RL is opposite to the
assumed reference direction. Consequently, the current through RL will, in
fact, be upward with a magnitude of 0.7 A.
b. If we assume (incorrectly) that the superposition theorem applies for
power, we would have the power due the first source given as
P1  I2

and the power due the second source as
P2  I2
L(2)RL  (1.2 A)2(16 )  23.04 W
The total power, if superposition applies, would be
PT  P1  P2  4.0 W  23.04 W  27.04 W
Clearly, this result is wrong, since the actual power dissipated by the load
resistor is correctly given as

EXAMPLE 9–2
Determine the voltage drop across the resistor R2 of the
circuit shown in Figure 9–4.
Solution
Since this circuit has three separate sources, it is necessary to
determine the voltage across R2 due to each individual source.
First, we consider the voltage across R2 due to the 16-V source as shown
in Figure 9–5.

Figure 9–6.

Finally, the voltage due to the 32-V source is found by analyzing the circuit
of Figure 9–7.

9.2
Thévenin’s Theorem
In this section, we will apply one of the most important theorems of electric
circuits. Thévenin’s theorem allows even the most complicated circuit to be
reduced to a single voltage source and a single resistance. The importance of
such a theorem becomes evident when we try to analyze a circuit as shown
in Figure 9–8.
If we wanted to find the current through the variable load resistor when
RL  0, RL  2 k, and RL  5 k using existing methods, we would need
to analyze the entire circuit three separate times. However, if we could
reduce the entire circuit external to the load resistor to a single voltage
source in series with a resistor, the solution becomes very easy.
Thévenin’s theorem is a circuit analysis technique which reduces any
linear bilateral network to an equivalent circuit having only one voltage

source and one series resistor. The resulting two-terminal circuit is equiva-
lent to the original circuit when connected to any external branch or compo-
nent. In summary, Thévenin’s theorem is simplified as follows:
Any linear bilateral network may be reduced to a simplified two-termi-
nal circuit consisting of a single voltage source in series with a single resis-
tor as shown in Figure 9–9.
A linear network, remember, is any network that consists of components
having a linear (straight-line) relationship between voltage and current. A
resistor is a good example of a linear component since the voltage across a
resistor increases proportionally to an increase in current through the resis-
tor. Voltage and current sources are also linear components. In the case of a
voltage source, the voltage remains constant although current through the
source may change.
A bilateral network is any network that operates in the same manner
regardless of the direction of current in the network. Again, a resistor is a
good example of a bilateral component, since the magnitude of current
through the resistor is not dependent upon the polarity of voltage across the
component. (A diode is not a bilateral component, since the magnitude of
current through the device is dependent upon the polarity of the voltage
applied across the diode.)
The following steps provide a technique which converts any circuit into
its Thévenin equivalent:
1. Remove the load from the circuit.
2. Label the resulting two terminals. We will label them as a and b, although
any notation may be used.
3. Set all sources in the circuit to zero.
Voltage sources are set to zero by replacing them with short circuits (zero
volts).
Current sources are set to zero by replacing them with open circuits (zero
amps).
4. Determine the Thévenin equivalent resistance, RTh, by calculating the
resistance “seen” between terminals a and b. It may be necessary to
redraw the circuit to simplify this step.
5. Replace the sources removed in Step 3, and determine the open-circuit
voltage between the terminals. If the circuit has more than one source, it
may be necessary to use the superposition theorem. In that case, it will be

Notice that the circuit of Figure 9–21 has nodes a and b conveniently shown
at the top and bottom of the circuit. Additional nodes (node c and node d)
are added to simplify the task of correctly placing resistors between the

After simplifying a circuit, it is always a good idea to ensure that the
resulting circuit is indeed an equivalent circuit. You may verify the equiva-
lence of the two circuits by confirming that each component is connected
between the same nodes for each circuit.
Now that we have a circuit which is easier to analyze, we find the

dependent upon the value of the series resistance of the source.

Norton’s Theorem
Norton’s theorem is a circuit analysis technique which is similar to
Thévenin’s theorem. By using this theorem the circuit is reduced to a single
current source and one parallel resistor. As with the Thévenin equivalent cir-
cuit, the resulting two-terminal circuit is equivalent to the original circuit
when connected to any external branch or component. In summary, Norton’s
theorem may be simplified as follows:
Any linear bilateral network may be reduced to a simplified two-termi-
nal circuit consisting of a single current source and a single shunt resistor as
shown in Figure 9–26.
The following steps provide a technique which allows the conversion of
any circuit into its Norton equivalent:
1. Remove the load from the circuit.
2. Label the resulting two terminals. We will label them as a and b, although
any notation may be used.
3. Set all sources to zero. As before, voltage sources are set to zero by
replacing them with short circuits and current sources are set to zero by
replacing them with open circuits.

through the short due to each source. The circuit for each calculation is illus-
trated in Figure 9–31.

Current Source, I: By examining the circuit for the current source [Figure 9–
31(b)] we see that the short circuit between terminals a and b effectively
removes R1 from the circuit. Therefore, the current through the short will be
Iab(2)  2.00 A
Notice that the current Iab is indicated as being a negative quantity. As we
have seen before, this result merely indicates that the actual current is oppo-
site to the assumed reference direction.
Now, applying the superposition theorem, we find the Norton current as
IN  Iab(1)  Iab(2)  0.833 A  2.0 A  1.167 A

Section 9.3 I Norton’s Theorem
345
As before, the negative sign indicates that the short-circuit current is actually
from terminal b toward terminal a.
Step 6: The resultant Norton equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9–32.
Now we can easily find the current through load resistor RL by using the cur-
rent divider rule:

Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
In amplifiers and in most communication circuits such as radio receivers and
transmitters, it is often desired that the load receive the maximum amount of
power from a source.
The maximum power transfer theorem states the following:
A load resistance will receive maximum power from a circuit when the
resistance of the load is exactly the same as the Thévenin (Norton) resistance
looking back at the circuit.
The proof for the maximum power transfer theorem is determined from
the Thévenin equivalent circuit and involves the use of calculus. This theo-
rem is proved in Appendix C.
From Figure 9–45 we see that once the network has been simplified using
either Thévenin’s or Norton’s theorem, maximum power will occur when
RL  RTh  RN
(9–3)
Examining the equivalent circuits of Figure 9–45, shows that the follow-
ing equations determine the power delivered to the load:

We may first set up a table of data for various values of resistance,
RL. See Table 9–1. Voltage and current values are determined by using the

of resistance is determined by finding the product PL  VLIL, or by using

Notice in the graphs that although voltage across the load increases as
RL increases, the power delivered to the load will be a maximum when RL 
RTh  5 . The reason for this apparent contradiction is because, as RL
increases, the reduction in current more than offsets the corresponding
increase in voltage.

Solution
a. In order to determine the conditions for maximum power transfer, it is first
necessary to determine the equivalent circuit external to the load. We may
determine either the Thévenin equivalent circuit or the Norton equivalent
circuit. This circuit was analyzed in Example 9–4 using Thévenin’s theorem,
and we determined the equivalent circuit to be as shown in Figure 9–51.
Maximum power will be transferred to the load when RL  1.5 k.
b. Letting RL  1.5 k, we see that half of the Thévenin voltage will appear
across the load resistor and half will appear across the Thévenin resis-
tance. So, at maximum power,

For communication circuits and for many amplifier circuits, 50% repre-
sents the maximum possible efficiency. At this efficiency level, the voltage
presented to the following stage would only be half of the maximum termi-
nal voltage.
In power transmission such as the 115-Vac, 60-Hz power in your home,
the condition of maximum power is not a requirement. Under the condition
of maximum power transfer, the voltage across the load will be reduced to
half of the maximum available terminal voltage. Clearly, if we are work-
ing with power supplies, we would like to ensure that efficiency is
brought as close to 100% as possible. In such cases, load resistance RL is
kept much larger than the internal resistance of the voltage source (typically
RL  10Rint), ensuring that the voltage appearing across the load will be very
nearly equal to the maximum terminal voltage of the voltage source.

tance of the source (typically RL  10Rint). If, on the other hand, it is more
important to ensure maximum power transfer, then the load resistance should
equal the source resistance (RL  Rint).

The substitution theorem states the following:
Any branch within a circuit may be replaced by an equivalent branch,
provided the replacement branch has the same current through it and voltage
across it as the original branch.
This theorem is best illustrated by examining the operation of a circuit.

Although each of the branches in Figure 9–54 is different, the current
entering or leaving each branch will be same as that in the original branch.
Similarly, the voltage across each branch will be the same. If any of these
branches is substituted into the original circuit, the balance of the circuit will
operate in the same way as the original. It is left as an exercise for the stu-
dent to verify that each circuit behaves the same as the original.
This theorem allows us to replace any branch within a given circuit with
an equivalent branch, thereby simplifying the analysis of the remaining cir-
cuit.

Millman’s Theorem
Millman’s theorem is used to simplify circuits having several parallel volt-
age sources as illustrated in Figure 9–57. Although any of the other theorems
developed in this chapter will work in this case, Millman’s theorem provides
a much simpler and more direct equivalent.
In circuits of the type shown in Figure 9–57, the voltage sources may be
replaced with a single equivalent source as shown in Figure 9–58.

To find the values of the equivalent voltage source Eeq and series resis-

its equivalent current source using the technique developed in Chapter 8.
The value of each current source would be determined by using Ohm’s law
(i.e., I1  E1/R1, I2  E2/R2, etc.). After the source conversions are com-
pleted, the circuit appears as shown in Figure 9–59.

From the circuit of Figure 9–59 we see that all of the current sources
have the same direction. Clearly, this will not always be the case since the
direction of each current source will be determined by the initial polarity of
the corresponding voltage source.

It is now possible to replace the n current sources with a single current
source having a magnitude given as

Reciprocity Theorem
The reciprocity theorem is a theorem which can only be used with single-
source circuits. This theorem, however, may be applied to either voltage
sources or current sources. The theorem states the following:
Voltage Sources
A voltage source causing a current I in any branch of a circuit may be
removed from the original location and placed into that branch having the
current I. The voltage source in the new location will produce a current in
the original source location which is exactly equal to the originally calcu-
lated current, I.
When applying the reciprocity theorem for a voltage source, the follow-
ing steps must be followed:
1. The voltage source is replaced by a short circuit in the original location.
2. The polarity of the source in the new location is such that the current
direction in that branch remains unchanged.

The equivalent circuit using Millman’s theorem is shown in Figure 9–61.
Notice that the equivalent voltage source has a polarity which is opposite to
the originally assumed polarity. This is because the voltage sources E1 and E3
have magnitudes which overcome the polarity and magnitude of the source E2.

Current Sources
A current source causing a voltage V at any node of a circuit may be
removed from the original location and connected to that node. The current
source in the new location will produce a voltage in the original source loca-
tion which is exactly equal to the originally calculated voltage, V.
When applying the reciprocity theorem for a current source, the follow-
ing conditions must be met:
1. The current source is replaced by an open circuit in the original location.
2. The direction of the source in the new location is such that the polarity of
the voltage at the node to which the current source is now connected
remains unchanged.
The following examples illustrate how the reciprocity theorem is used
within a circuit.

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
Electronics Workbench and PSpice are easily used to illustrate the important
theorems developed in this chapter. We will use each software package in a
somewhat different approach to verify the theorems. Electronics Workbench
allows us to “build and test” a circuit just as it would be done in a lab. When
using PSpice we will activate the Probe postprocessor to provide a graphical
display of voltage, current, and power as a function of load resistance.

b. Remove the current source I and place it between node b and the reference

The resulting node voltages are now found as follows:

2. Just as in a lab, we will use a multimeter to find the open circuit
(Thévenin) voltage and the short circuit (Norton) current. As well, the
multimeter is used to measure the Thévenin (Norton) resistance. The steps
in these measurements are essentially the same as those used to theoreti-
cally determine the equivalent circuits.
a. We begin by removing the load resistor, RL from the circuit (using the
Edit menu and the Cut/Paste menu items). The remaining terminals are
labeled as a and b.
b. The Thévenin voltage is measured by simply connecting the multimeter
between terminals a and b. After clicking on the power switch, we
obtain a reading of ETh  11.25 V as shown in Figure 9–68.

c. With the multimeter between terminals a and b, the Norton current is
easily measured by switching the multimeter to its ammeter range.
After clicking on the power switch, we obtain a reading of IN  7.50
mA as shown in Figure 9–69.
FIGURE 9–69
d. In order to measure the Thévenin resistance, the voltage source is
removed and replaced by a short circuit (wire) and the current source is
removed and replaced by an open circuit. Now, with the multimeter
connected between terminals a and b it is set to measure resistance (by

clicking on the  button). After clicking on the power switch, we have
the display shown in Figure 9–70. The multimeter provides the
Thévenin resistance as RTh  1.5 k.

Note: From the previous example we see that it is not necessary to directly
measure the Thévenin (Norton) resistance since the value can be easily cal-
culated from the Thévenin voltage and the Norton current. The following

PSpice
As we have already seen, PSpice has an additional postprocessor called
PROBE, which is able to provide a graphical display of numerous variables.
The following example uses PSpice to illustrate the maximum power trans-
fer theorem.

• Double click on each resistor in the circuit and change the Reference cells
to RTH and RL. Click on Apply to accept the changes.
• Double click on the value for RL and enter {Rx}. Place the PARAM part
adjacent to RL. Use the Property Editor to assign a default value of 10  to
Rx. Click on Apply. Have the display show the name and value and then
exit the Property Editor.
• Adjust the Simulation Settings to result in a DC sweep of the load resistor
from 0.1  to 10  in 0.1  increments. (Refer to Example 7–15 for the
complete procedure.)
• Click on the Run icon once the circuit is complete.
• Once the design is simulated, you will see a blank screen with the abscissa
(horizontal axis) showing RX scaled from 0 to 10 .
• Since we would like to have a simultaneous display of voltage, current, and
power, it is necessary to do the following:
To display VL: Click Trace and then Add Trace. Select V(RL:1). Click
OK and the load voltage will appear as a function of load resistance.
To display IL: First add another axis by clicking on Plot and Add Y Axis.
Next, click Trace and then Add Trace. Select I(RL). Click OK and the load
current will appear as a function of load resistance.
To display PL: Add another Y axis. Click Trace and Add Trace. Now,
since power is not one of the options that can be automatically selected, it
is necessary to enter the power into the Trace Expression box. One method
of doing this is to enter I(RL)*V(RL:1) and then click OK. Adjust the lim-
its of the Y axis by clicking on Plot and Axis Settings. Click on the Y Axis
tab and select the User Defined Data Range. Set the limits from 0W to 5W.

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
A
simple battery cell (such as a “D” cell) can be represented as a Thévenin
equivalent circuit as shown in the accompanying figure.
The Thévenin voltage represents the open-circuit (or unloaded) voltage of the
battery cell, while the Thévenin resistance is the internal resistance of the bat-
tery. When a load resistance is connected across the terminals of the battery,
the voltage Vab will decrease due to the voltage drop across the internal resis-
tor. By taking two measurements, it is possible to find the Thévenin equiva-
lent circuit of the battery.
When no load is connected between the terminals of the battery, the ter-
minal voltage is found to be Vab  1.493 V. When a resistance of RL  10.6 
is connected across the terminals, the voltage is measured to be Vab  1.430 V.
Determine the Thévenin equivalent circuit of the battery. Use the measure-
ments to determine the efficiency of the battery for the given load.

A
capacitor is a circuit component designed to store electrical charge. If you
connect a dc voltage source to a capacitor, for example, the capacitor will
“charge” to the voltage of the source. If you then disconnect the source, the
capacitor will remain charged, i.e., its voltage will remain constant at the value
to which it had risen while connected to the source (assuming no leakage).
Because of this tendency to hold voltage, a capacitor opposes changes in volt-
age. It is this characteristic that gives capacitors their unique properties.
Capacitors are widely used in electrical and electronic applications. They
are used in radio and TV systems, for example, to tune in signals, in cameras to
store the charge that fires the photoflash, on pump and refrigeration motors to
increase starting torque, in electric power systems to increase operating effi-
ciency, and so on. Photos of some typical capacitors are shown in Figures 10–15
and 10–16.
Capacitance is the electrical property of capacitors: it is a measure of how
much charge a capacitor can hold. In this chapter, we look at capacitance and its
basic properties. In Chapter 11, we look at capacitors in dc and pulse circuits; in
later chapters, we look at capacitors in ac applications.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Michael Faraday and the Field Concept
THE UNIT OF CAPACITANCE, the farad, is named after Michael Faraday (1791–
1867). Born in England to a working class family, Faraday received limited edu-
cation. Nonetheless, he was responsible for many of the fundamental discoveries
of electricity and magnetism. Lacking mathematical skills, he used his intuitive
ability rather than mathematical models to develop conceptual pictures of basic
phenomena. It was his development of the field concept that made it possible to
map out the fields that exist around electrical charges.
To get at this idea, recall from Chapter 2 that unlike charges attract and like
charges repel, i.e. a force exists between charges. We call the region where this
force acts an electric field. To visualize this field, we use Faraday’s field concept
and draw lines of force (or flux lines) that show at every point in space the mag-
nitude and direction of the force. Now, rather than supposing that one charge
exerts a force on another, we instead visualize that the original charges create a
field in space and that other charges introduced into this field experience a force
due to the field. This concept is helpful in studying certain aspects of capacitors,
as you will see in this chapter.
The development of the field concept had a significant impact on science.
We now picture several important phenomena in terms of fields, including elec-
tric fields, gravitation, and magnetism. When Faraday published his theory in
1844, however, it was not taken seriously, much like Ohm’s work two decades
earlier. It is also interesting to note that the development of the field concept
grew out of Faraday’s research into magnetism, not electric charge.

Since the plates of the capacitor are metal, they contain huge numbers of
free electrons. In their normal state, however, they are uncharged, that is,
there is no excess or deficiency of electrons on either plate. If a dc source is
now connected (Figure 10–2), electrons are pulled from the top plate by the
positive potential of the battery and the same number deposited on the bot-
tom plate. This leaves the top plate with a deficiency of electrons (i.e., posi-
tive charge) and the bottom plate with an excess (i.e., negative charge). In
this state, the capacitor is said to be charged. If the amount of charge trans-
ferred during this process is Q coulombs, we say that the capacitor has a
charge of Q.
If we now disconnect the source (Figure 10–3), the excess electrons that
were moved to the bottom plate remain trapped as they have no way to
return to the top plate. The capacitor therefore remains charged even though
no source is present. Because of this, we say that a capacitor can store
charge. Capacitors with little leakage (Section 10.5) can hold their charge
for a considerable time.
Large capacitors charged to high voltages contain a great deal of energy
and can give you a bad shock. Always discharge capacitors after power has
been removed if you intend to handle them. You can do this by shorting a
wire across their leads. Electrons then return to the top plate, restoring the
charge balance and reducing the capacitor voltage to zero. (However, you
also need to be concerned about residual voltage due to dielectric absorption.
This is discussed in Section 10.5.)
Definition of Capacitance
The amount of charge Q that a capacitor can store depends on the applied
voltage. Experiments show that for a given capacitor, Q is proportional to
voltage. Let the constant of proportionality be C. Then,

Capacitance
A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. One of its
basic forms is the parallel-plate capacitor shown in Figure 10–1. It consists
of two metal plates separated by a nonconducting material (i.e., an insulator)
called a dielectric. The dielectric may be air, oil, mica, plastic, ceramic, or
other suitable insulating material.

(10–2)
The term C is defined as the capacitance of the capacitor. As indicated, its
unit is the farad. By definition, the capacitance of a capacitor is one farad if
it stores one coulomb of charge when the voltage across its terminals is one
volt. The farad, however, is a very large unit. Most practical capacitors range
in size from picofarads (pF or 1012 F) to microfarads (mF or 106 F). The
larger the value of C, the more charge that the capacitor can hold for a given
voltage.

Factors Affecting Capacitance
Effect of Area
As shown by Equation 10–2, capacitance is directly proportional to charge.
This means that the more charge you can put on a capacitor’s plates for a
given voltage, the greater will be its capacitance. Consider Figure 10–4. The
capacitor of (b) has four times the area of (a). Since it has the same number
of free electrons per unit area, it has four times the total charge and hence
four times the capacitance. This turns out to be true in general, that is,
capacitance is directly proportional to plate area.

For a fixed separation, capacitance is proportional to plate area.

Effect of Spacing
Now consider Figure 10–5. Since the top plate has a deficiency of electrons
and the bottom plate an excess, a force of attraction exists across the gap.
For a fixed spacing as in (a), the charges are in equilibrium. Now move the
plates closer together as in (b). As spacing decreases, the force of attraction
increases, pulling more electrons from within the material of plate B to its
top surface. This creates a deficiency of electrons in the lower levels of B. To
replenish these, the source moves additional electrons around the circuit,
leaving A with an even greater deficiency and B with an even greater excess.
The charge on the plates therefore increases and hence, according to Equa-
tion 10–2, so does the capacitance. We therefore conclude that decreasing
spacing increases capacitance, and vice versa. In fact, as we will show later,
capacitance is inversely proportional to plate spacing.

Effect of Dielectric
Capacitance also depends on the dielectric. Consider Figure 10–6(a), which
shows an air-dielectric capacitor. If you substitute different materials for air,
the capacitance increases. Table 10–1 shows the factor by which capacitance
increases for a number of different materials. For example, if Teflon® is
used instead of air, capacitance is increased by a factor of 2.1. This factor is
called the relative dielectric constant or relative permittivity of the mater-

Dielectric Constant
The constant  in Equation 10–3 is the absolute dielectric constant of the
insulating material. Its units are farads per meter (F/m). For air or vacuum,
 has a value of o  8.85  1012 F/m. For other materials,  is
expressed as the product of the relative dielectric constant, r (shown in
Table 10–1), times o. That is,

Electric Fields
Electric Flux
Electric fields are force fields that exist in the region surrounding charged bod-
ies. Some familiarity with electric fields is necessary to understand dielectrics
and their effect on capacitance. We now look briefly at the key ideas.
Consider Figure 10–8(a). As noted in Chapter 2, unlike charges attract
and like charges repel, i.e. a force exists between them. The region where
this force exists is called an electric field. To visualize this field, we use
390
Chapter 10 I Capacitors and Capacitance
Solution
a. Since the plate area has increased by a factor of five and everything else
remains the same, C increases by a factor of five. Thus, C  5(12 pF) 
60 pF.
b. With four times the plate area, C increases by a factor of four. With one-fifth
the plate spacing, C increases by a factor of five. Thus, C  (4)(5)(12 pF) 
240 pF.
c. Dry paper increases C by a factor of 2.2. The increase in plate area
increases C by a factor of six. Doubling the plate spacing reduces C by
one-half. Thus, C  (2.2)(6)(1⁄2)(12 pF)  79.2 pF.

oil dielectric:
a. Compute its capacitance;
b. If the charge on this capacitor is 0.424 mC, what is the voltage across its
plates?
2. For a parallel-plate capacitor, if you triple the plate area and halve the plate
spacing, how does capacitance change?
3. For the capacitor of Figure 10–6, if you use mica instead of ceramic, what
will be the capacitance?
4. What is the dielectric for the capacitor of Figure 10–7(b)?

Faraday’s field concept. The direction of the field is defined as the direction
of force on a positive charge. It is therefore directed outward from the posi-
tive charge and inward toward the negative charge as shown. Field lines
never cross, and the density of the lines indicates the strength of the field;
i.e., the more dense the lines, the stronger the field. Figure 10–8(b) shows
the field of a parallel-plate capacitor. In this case, the field is uniform across
the gap, with some fringing near its edges. Electric flux lines are represented
by the Greek letter w (psi).

Electric Field Intensity
The strength of an electric field, also called its electric field intensity, is the
force per unit charge that the field exerts on a small, positive test charge, Qt.
Let the field strength be denoted by . Then, by definition,
  F/Qt
(newtons/coulomb, N/C)

To illustrate, let us determine the field about a point charge, Q. When the
test charge is placed near Q, it experiences a force of F  kQQt/r2
(Coulomb’s law, Chapter 2). The constant in Coulomb’s law is actually equal
to 1/4p. Thus, F  QQt/4pr 2, and from Equation 10–6,

An easy way to visualize this is to think of one flux line as emanating from
each positive charge on the body as shown in Figure 10–9. Then, as indi-
cated, the total number of lines is equal to the total number of charges.
Field of a Parallel-Plate Capacitor
Now consider a parallel-plate capacitor (Figure 10–10). The field here is
created by the charge distributed over its plates. Since plate A has a defi-
ciency of electrons, it looks like a sheet of positive charge, while plate B
looks like a sheet of negative charge. A positive test charge Qt between
these sheets is therefore repelled by the positive sheet and attracted by the
negative sheet.
Now move the test charge from plate B to plate A. The work W required
to move the charge against the force F is force times distance. Thus,
W  Fd
(J)
(10–11)
In Chapter 2, we defined voltage as work divided by charge, i.e., V  W/Q.
Since the charge here is the test charge, Qt, the voltage between plates A and
B is
V  W/Qt  (Fd)/Qt
(V)
(10–12)
Now divide both sides by d. This yields V/d  F/Qt. But F/Qt  , from
Equation 10–6. Thus,
  V/d
(V/m)
(10–13)
Equation 10–13 shows that the electric field strength between capacitor
plates is equal to the voltage across the plates divided by the distance
between them.

10.4
Dielectrics
As you saw in Figure 10–6, a dielectric increases capacitance. We now
examine why. Consider Figure 10–11. For a charged capacitor, electron
orbits (which are normally circular) become elliptical as electrons are
attracted toward the positive () plate and repelled from the negative ()
plate. This makes the end of the atom nearest the positive plate appear nega-
tive while its other end appears positive. Such atoms are polarized.
Throughout the bulk of the dielectric, the negative end of a polarized atom is
adjacent to the positive end of another atom, and the effects cancel. How-
ever, at the surfaces of the dielectric, there are no atoms to cancel, and the
net effect is as if a layer of negative charge exists on the surface of the
dielectric at the positive plate and a layer of positive charge at the negative
plate. This makes the plates appear closer, thus increasing capacitance.
Materials for which the effect is largest result in the greatest increase in
capacitance.
Voltage Breakdown
If the voltage of Figure 10–11 is increased beyond a critical value, the force
on the electrons is so great that they are literally torn from orbit. This is
called dielectric breakdown and the electric field intensity (Equation 10–
13) at breakdown is called the dielectric strength of the material. For air,
breakdown occurs when the voltage gradient reaches 3 kV/mm. The break-
down strengths for other materials are shown in Table 10–2. Since the qual-
ity of a dielectric depends on many factors, dielectric strength varies from
sample to sample. Solid dielectrics are usually damaged by breakdown.
Breakdown is not limited to capacitors; it can occur with any type of
electrical apparatus whose insulation is stressed beyond safe limits. (For

Capacitor Voltage Rating
Because of dielectric breakdown, capacitors are rated for maximum operat-
ing voltage (called working voltage) by their manufacturer (indicated on the
capacitor as WVDC or working voltage dc). If you operate a capacitor
beyond its working voltage, you may damage it.
10.5
Nonideal Effects
So far, we have assumed ideal capacitors. However, real capacitors have
nonideal characteristics.
Leakage Current
When a charged capacitor is disconnected from its source, it will eventually
discharge. This is because no insulator is perfect and a small amount of
charge “leaks” through the dielectric. Similarly, a small leakage current will
pass through its dielectric when a capacitor is connected to a source.
The effect of leakage is modeled by a resistor in Figure 10–12. Since
leakage is very small, R is very large, typically hundreds of megohms. The
larger R is, the longer a capacitor can hold its charge. For most applications,
leakage can be neglected.

Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR)
As a capacitor ages, resistance may develop in its leads as its internal con-
nections begin to fail. This resistance is in series with the capacitor and may
eventually cause problems.
Dielectric Absorption
When a capacitor is discharged by temporarily shorting its leads, it should
have zero volts when the short is removed. However, atoms sometimes
remain partially polarized, and when the short is removed, they cause a
residual voltage to appear across the capacitor. This effect is known as
dielectric absorption. In electronic circuits, the voltage due to dielectric
absorption can upset circuit voltage levels; in TV tubes and electrical power
apparatus, it can result in large and potentially dangerous voltages.
Temperature Coefficient
Because dielectrics are affected by temperature, capacitance may change
with temperature. If capacitance increases with increasing temperature, the
capacitor is said to have a positive temperature coefficient; if it
decreases, the capacitor has a negative temperature coefficient; if it
remains essentially constant, the capacitor has a zero temperature coeffi-
cient.
The temperature coefficient is specified as a change in capacitance in
parts per million (ppm) per degree Celsius. Consider a 1-mF capacitor. Since
1 mF  1 million pF, 1 ppm is 1 pF. Thus, a 1-mF capacitor with a tempera-
ture coefficient of 200 ppm/°C could change as much as 200 pF per degree
Celsius.
10.6
Types of Capacitors
Since no single capacitor type suits all applications, capacitors are made in a
variety of types and sizes. Among these are fixed and variable types with dif-
fering dielectrics and recommended areas of application.
Fixed Capacitors
Fixed capacitors are often identified by their dielectric. Common dielectric
materials include ceramic, plastic, and mica, plus, for electrolytic capacitors,
aluminum and tantalum oxide. Design variations include tubular and inter-
leaved plates. The interleave design (Figure 10–13) uses multiple plates to
increase effective plate area. A layer of insulation separates plates, and alter-
nate plates are connected together. The tubular design (Figure 10–14) uses
sheets of metal foil separated by an insulator such as plastic film. Fixed
capacitors are encapsulated in plastic, epoxy resin, or other insulating mater-
ial and identified with value, tolerance, and other appropriate data either via
body markings or color coding. Electrical characteristics and physical size
depend on the dielectric used.
Section 10.6 I Types of Capacitors
395

Ceramic Capacitors
First, consider ceramic. The permittivity of ceramic varies widely (as indi-
cated in Table 10–1). At one end are ceramics with extremely high permittiv-
ity. These permit packaging a great deal of capacitance in a small space, but
yield capacitors whose characteristics vary widely with temperature and
operating voltage. However, they are popular in limited temperature applica-
tions where small size and cost are important. At the other end are ceramics
with highly stable characteristics. They yield capacitors whose values
change little with temperature, voltage, or aging. However, since their
dielectric constants are relatively low (typically 30 to 80), these capacitors
are physically larger than those made using high-permittivity ceramic. Many
surface mount capacitors (considered later in this section) use ceramic
dielectrics.
Plastic Film Capacitors
Plastic-film capacitors are of two basic types: film/foil or metalized film.
Film/foil capacitors use metal foil separated by plastic film as in Figure 10–
14, while metallized-film capacitors have their foil material vacuum-
deposited directly onto plastic film. Film/foil capacitors are generally larger
than metallized-foil units, but have better capacitance stability and higher
insulation resistance. Typical film materials are polyester, Mylar, polypropy-
lene, and polycarbonate. Figure 10–15 shows a selection of plastic-film
capacitors.
Metalized-film capacitors are self-healing. Thus, if voltage stress at an
imperfection exceeds breakdown, an arc occurs which evaporates the metal-

lized area around the fault, isolating the defect. (Film/foil capacitors are not
self-healing.)
Mica Capacitors
Mica capacitors are low in cost with low leakage and good stability. Avail-
able values range from a few picofarads to about 0.1 mF.
Electrolytic Capacitors
Electrolytic capacitors provide large capacitance (i.e., up to several hundred
thousand microfarads) at a relatively low cost. (Their capacitance is large
because they have a very thin layer of oxide as their dielectric.) However, their
leakage is relatively high and breakdown voltage relatively low. Electrolytics
have either aluminum or tantalum as their plate material. Tantalum devices are
smaller than aluminum devices, have less leakage, and are more stable.
The basic aluminum electrolytic capacitor construction is similar to that
of Figure 10–14, with strips of aluminum foil separated by gauze saturated
with an electrolyte. During manufacture, chemical action creates a thin oxide
layer that acts as the dielectric. This layer must be maintained during use.
For this reason, electrolytic capacitors are polarized (marked with a  and 
sign), and the plus () terminal must always be kept positive with respect to
the minus () terminal. Electrolytic capacitors have a shelf life; that is, if
they are not used for an extended period, they may fail when powered up
again. Figure 10–16 shows a selection of aluminum electrolytic devices.

Surface Mount Capacitors
Many electronic products now use surface mount devices (SMDs). (SMDs
do not have connection leads, but are soldered directly onto printed circuit
boards.) Figure 10–18 shows a surface mount, ceramic chip capacitor. Such
devices are extremely small and provide high packaging density.
Variable Capacitors
The most common variable capacitor is that used in radio tuning circuits
(Figure 10–19). It has a set of stationary plates and a set of movable plates
which are ganged together and mounted on a shaft. As the shaft is rotated,
the movable plates mesh with the stationary plates, changing the effective
surface area (and hence the capacitance).
Another adjustable type is the trimmer or padder capacitor, which is
used for fine adjustments, usually over a very small range. In contrast to the
variable capacitor (which is frequently varied by the user), a trimmer is usu-
ally set to its required value, then never touched again.

Tantalum capacitors come in two basic types: wet slug and solid dielec-
tric. Figure 10–17 shows a cutaway view of a solid tantalum unit. The slug,
made from powdered tantalum, is highly porous and provides a large internal
surface area that is coated with an oxide to form the dielectric. Tantalum
capacitors are polarized and must be inserted into a circuit properly.

Capacitor Current and Voltage
As noted earlier (Figure 10–2), during charging, electrons are moved from
one plate of a capacitor to the other plate. Several points should be noted.
1. This movement of electrons constitutes a current.
2. This current lasts only long enough for the capacitor to charge. When the
capacitor is fully charged, current is zero.
3. Current in the circuit during charging is due solely to the movement of
electrons from one plate to the other around the external circuit; no cur-
rent passes through the dielectric between the plates.
4. As charge is deposited on the plates, the capacitor voltage builds. How-
ever, this voltage does not jump to full value immediately since it takes
time to move electrons from one plate to the other. (Billions of electrons
must be moved.)
5. Since voltage builds up as charging progresses, the difference in voltage
between the source and the capacitor decreases and hence the rate of
movement of electrons (i.e., the current) decreases as the capacitor
approaches full charge.
Figure 10–25 shows what the voltage and current look like during the
charging process. As indicated, the current starts out with an initial surge,
then decays to zero while the capacitor voltage gradually climbs from zero
to full voltage. The charging time typically ranges from nanoseconds to mil-
liseconds, depending on the resistance and capacitance of the circuit. (We
study these relationships in detail in Chapter 11.) A similar surge (but in the
opposite direction) occurs during discharge.
As Figure 10–25 indicates, current exists only while the capacitor volt-
age is changing. This observation turns out to be true in general, that is,

current in a capacitor exists only while capacitor voltage is changing. The
reason is not hard to understand. As you saw before, a capacitor’s dielectric
is an insulator and consequently no current can pass through it (assuming
zero leakage). The only charges that can move, therefore, are the free elec-
trons that exist on the capacitor’s plates. When capacitor voltage is con-
stant, these charges are in equilibrium, no net movement of charge occurs,
and the current is thus zero. However, if the source voltage is increased,
additional electrons are pulled from the positive plate; inversely, if the
source voltage is decreased, excess electrons on the negative plate are
returned to the positive plate. Thus, in both cases, capacitor current results
when capacitor voltage is changed. As we show next, this current is propor-
tional to the rate of change of voltage. Before we do this, however, we
need to look at symbols.
Symbols for Time-Varying Voltages and Currents
Quantities that vary with time are called instantaneous quantities. Standard
industry practice requires that we use lowercase letters for time-varying
quantities, rather than capital letters as for dc. Thus, we use vC and iC to rep-
resent changing capacitor voltage and current rather than VC and IC. (Often
we drop the subscripts and just use v and i.) Since these quantities are func-
tions of time, they may also be shown as vC(t) and iC(t).
Capacitor v-i Relationship
The relationship between charge and voltage for a capacitor is given by
Equation 10–1. For the time-varying case, it is
q  CvC
(10–18)
But current is the rate of movement of charge. In calculus notation, this is
iC  dq/dt. Differentiating Equation 10–18 yields

Calculus is introduced at this
point to aid in the development
of ideas and to help explain
concepts. However, not every-
one who uses this book requires
calculus. Therefore, the material
is presented in such a manner
that it never relies entirely on
mathematics; thus, where calcu-
lus is used, intuitive explana-

Equation 10–20 shows that current through a capacitor is equal to C times
the rate of change of voltage across it. This means that the faster the voltage
changes, the larger the current, and vice versa. It also means that if the volt-
age is constant, the current is zero (as we noted earlier).
Reference conventions for voltage and current are shown in Figure 10–
26. As usual, the plus sign goes at the tail of the current arrow. If the voltage
is increasing, dvC/dt is positive and the current is in the direction of the refer-
ence arrow; if the voltage is decreasing, dvC/dt is negative and the current is
opposite to the arrow.
The derivative dvC/dt of Equation 10–20 is the slope of the capacitor
voltage versus time curve. When capacitor voltage varies linearly with time
(i.e., the relationship is a straight line as in Figure 10–27), Equation 10–20

Energy Stored by a Capacitor
An ideal capacitor does not dissipate power. When power is transferred to a
capacitor, all of it is stored as energy in the capacitor’s electric field. When
the capacitor is discharged, this stored energy is returned to the circuit.
To determine the stored energy, consider Figure 10–28. Power is given
by p  vi watts. Using calculus (see 
), it can be shown that the stored
energy is given by
W  1

where V is the voltage across the capacitor. This means that the energy at any
time depends on the value of the capacitor’s voltage at that time.

10.10 Capacitor Failures and Troubleshooting
Although capacitors are quite reliable, they may fail because of misapplica-
tion, excessive voltage, current, temperature, or simply because they age.
They can short internally, leads may become open, dielectrics may become
excessively leaky, and they may fail catastrophically due to incorrect use. (If
an electrolytic capacitor is connected with its polarity reversed, for example,
it may explode.) Capacitors should be used well within their rating limits.
Excessive voltage can lead to dielectric puncture creating pinholes that short
the plates together. High temperatures may cause an increase in leakage
and/or a permanent shift in capacitance. High temperatures may be caused
by inadequate heat removal, excessive current, lossy dielectrics, or an oper-
ating frequency beyond the capacitor’s rated limit.
Basic Testing with an Ohmmeter
Some basic (out-of-circuit) tests can be made with an analog ohmmeter. The
ohmmeter can detect opens and shorts and, to a certain extent, leaky
dielectrics. First, ensure that the capacitor is discharged, then set the ohmme-
ter to its highest range and connect it to the capacitor. (For electrolytic
devices, ensure that the plus () side of the ohmmeter is connected to the
plus () side of the capacitor.)

FIGURE 10–29
Capacitor testing.

Initially, the ohmmeter reading should be low, then for a good capacitor
gradually increase to infinity as the capacitor charges through the ohmmeter
circuit. (Or at least a very high value, since most good capacitors, except
electrolytics, have a resistance of hundreds of megohms.) For small capaci-
tors, however, the time to charge may be too short to yield useful results.
Faulty capacitors respond differently. If a capacitor is shorted, the meter
resistance reading will stay low. If it is leaky, the reading will be lower than
normal. If it is open circuited, the meter will indicate infinity immediately,
without dipping to zero when first connected.
Capacitor Testers
Ohmmeter testing of capacitors has its limitations; other tools may be needed.
Figure 10–29 shows two of them. The DMM in (a) can measure capacitance
and display it directly on its readout. The LCR (inductance, capacitance, resis-
tance) analyzer in (b) can determine capacitance as well as detect opens and
shorts. More sophisticated testers are available that determine capacitance
value, leakage at rated voltage, dielectric absorption, and so on.

A
s you saw in Chapter 10, capacitors do not charge or discharge instanta-
neously. Instead, as illustrated in Figure 10–25, voltages and currents take
time to reach their new values. The time taken to reach these new values (i.e., the
charge and discharge times) are dependent on the resistance and capacitance of
the circuit. During charge, for example, a capacitor charges at a rate determined
by its capacitance and the resistance through which it charges, while during dis-
charge, it discharges at a rate determined by its capacitance and the resistance
through which it discharges. Since the voltages and currents that exist during
these charging and discharging times are transitory in nature, they are called
transients. Transients do not last very long, typically only a fraction of a sec-
ond. However, they are important to us for a number of reasons, some of which
you will learn in this chapter.
Transients occur in both capacitive and inductive circuits. In capacitive cir-
cuits, they occur because capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously; in
inductive circuits, they occur because inductor current cannot change instanta-
neously. In this chapter, we look at capacitive transients; in Chapter 14, we look
at inductive transients. As you will see, many of the basic principles are the
same.
Note: Optional problems and derivations using calculus are marked by
a 
icon. They may be omitted without loss of continuity by those who do not
require calculus.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
Desirable and Undesirable Transients
TRANSIENTS OCCUR IN CAPACITIVE and inductive circuits whenever circuit con-
ditions are changed, for example, by the sudden application of a voltage, the
switching in or out of a circuit element, or the malfunctioning of a circuit com-
ponent. Some transients are desirable and useful; others occur under abnormal
conditions and are potentially destructive in nature.
An example of the latter is the transient that results when lightning strikes a
power line. Following a strike, the line voltage, which may have been only a few
thousand volts before the strike, momentarily rises to many hundreds of thou-
sands of volts or higher, then rapidly decays, while the current, which may have
been only a few hundred amps, suddenly rises to many times its normal value.
Although these transients do not last very long, they can cause serious damage.
While this is a rather severe example of a transient, it nonetheless illustrates that
during transient conditions, many of a circuit or system’s most difficult problems
may arise.
Some transient effects, on the other hand, are useful. For example, many
electronic devices and circuits depend on transient effects; these include timers,
oscillators, and waveshaping circuits. As you will see in this chapter and in later
electronics courses, the charge/discharge characteristic of RC circuits is funda-
mental to their operation.
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE

11.1
Introduction
A basic switched RC circuit is shown in Figure 11–1. Most of the key ideas
concerning charging and discharging and dc transients in RC circuits can be
developed from it.
Capacitor Charging
First, assume the capacitor is uncharged and that the switch is open. Now move
the switch to the charge position, Figure 11–2(a). At the instant the switch is
closed the current jumps to E/R amps, then decays to zero, while the voltage,
which is zero at the instant the switch is closed, gradually climbs to E volts.This
isshown in (b) and (c).The shapesof these curves areeasily explained.
First, consider voltage. In order to change capacitor voltage, electrons
must be moved from one plate to the other. Even for a relatively small capac-
itor, billions of electrons must be moved. This takes time. Consequently,
capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, i.e., it cannot jump

abruptly from one value to another. Instead, it climbs gradually and
smoothly as illustrated in Figure 11–2(b).
Now consider current. The movement of electrons noted above is a cur-
rent. As indicated in Figure 11–2(c), this current jumps abruptly from 0 to
E/R amps, i.e., the current is discontinuous. To understand why, consider
Figure 11–3(a). Since capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, its
value just after the switch is closed will be the same as it was just before the
switch is closed, namely 0 V. Since the voltage across the capacitor just after
the switch is closed is zero (even though there is current through it), the
capacitor looks momentarily like a short circuit. This is indicated in (b).
This is an important observation and is true in general, that is, an uncharged
capacitor looks like a short circuit at the instant of switching. Applying
Ohm’s law yields iC  E/R amps. This agrees with what we indicated in Fig-
ure 11–2(c).
Finally, note the trailing end of the current curve Figure 11–2(c). Since
the dielectric between the capacitor plates is an insulator, no current can pass
through it. This means that the current in the circuit, which is due entirely to

the movement of electrons from one plate to the other through the battery,
must decay to zero as the capacitor charges.
Steady State Conditions
When the capacitor voltage and current reach their final values and stop
changing (Figure 11–2(b) and (c)), the circuit is said to be in steady state.
Figure 11–4(a) shows the circuit after it has reached steady state. Note that
vC  E and iC  0. Since the capacitor has voltage across it but no current
through it, it looks like an open circuit as indicated in (b). This is also an
important observation and one that is true in general, that is, a capacitor
looks like an open circuit to steady state dc.

Capacitor Discharging
Now consider the discharge case, Figures 11–5 and 11–6. First, assume the
capacitor is charged to E volts and that the switch is open, Figure 11–5(a).
Now close the switch. Since the capacitor has E volts across it just before the
switch is closed, and since its voltage cannot change instantaneously, it will
still have E volts across it just after as well. This is indicated in (b). The
capacitor therefore looks momentarily like a voltage source, (c) and the cur-

EXAMPLE 11–1
For Figure 11–1, E  40 V, R  10 , and the capacitor is
initially uncharged. The switch is moved to the charge position and the capac-
itor allowed to charge fully. Then the switch is moved to the discharge posi-
tion and the capacitor allowed to discharge fully. Sketch the voltages and cur-
rents and determine the values at switching and in steady state.

The current and voltage curves are shown in Figure 11–7. Initially,
i  0 A since the switch is open. Immediately after it is moved to the charge
position, the current jumps to E/R  40 V/10   4 A; then it decays to zero.
At the same time, vC starts at 0 V and climbs to 40 V. When the switch is
moved to the discharge position, the capacitor looks momentarily like a 40-V
source and the current jumps to 40 V/10   4 A; then it decays to zero.

The Meaning of Time in Transient Analysis
The time t used in transient analysis is measured from the instant of switch-
ing. Thus, t  0 in Figure 11–2 is defined as the instant the switch is moved
to charge, while in Figure 11–6, it is defined as the instant the switch is
moved to discharge. Voltages and currents are then represented in terms of
this time as vC(t) and iC(t). For example, the voltage across a capacitor at t 
0 s is denoted as vC(0), while the voltage at t  10 ms is denoted as vC(10
ms), and so on.
A problem arises when a quantity is discontinuous as is the current of
Figure 11–2(c). Since its value is changing at t  0 s, iC(0) cannot be
defined. To get around this problem, we define two values for 0 s. We
define t  0 s as t  0 s just prior to switching and t  0 s as t  0 s just
after switching. In Figure 11–2(c), therefore, iC(0)  0 A while iC(0) 
E/R amps. For Figure 11–6, iC(0)  0 A and iC(0)  E/R amps.
Exponential Functions
As we will soon show, the waveforms of Figures 11–2 and 11–6 are expo-
nential and vary according to ex or (1  ex), where e is the base of the nat-
ural logarithm. Fortunately, exponential functions are easy to evaluate with
modern calculators using their ex function. You will need to be able to evalu-
ate both ex and (1  ex) for any value of x. Table 11–1 shows a tabulation
of values for both cases. Note that as x gets larger, ex gets smaller and
approaches zero, while (1  ex) gets larger and approaches 1. These obser-
vations will be important to you in what follows.
Section 11.1 I Introduction

PRACTICAL NOTES...
Some key points to remember are the following:
1. Capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, but current can.
2. To determine currents and voltages in a circuit at the instant of switching,
replace uncharged capacitors with short circuits and charged capacitors
with dc sources equal to their respective voltages at the instant of switching.
3. To determine currents and voltages in a dc circuit after it has reached
steady state, replace capacitors with open circuits.
4. For both the charging and discharging cases, show capacitor current iC
such that the plus sign for vC is at the tail of the current reference arrow.
For charging, you will find that current is in the same direction as iC and
hence is positive, while for discharging, current is opposite in direction to
iC and hence is negative.

PROBLEMS 1
1. Use your calculator and verify the entries in Table 11–1. Be sure to change
the sign of x before using the e x function. Note that e0  e0  1 since any
quantity raised to the zeroth power is one.
2. Plot the computed values on graph paper and verify that they yield curves that
look like those shown in Figure 11–2(b) and (c).

Consider Figure 11–8. KVL yields

Equation 11–2 can be solved for vC using basic calculus (see
). The result is
vC  E(1  et/RC)
(11–3)
where R is in ohms, C is in farads, t is in seconds and et/RC is the exponen-
tial function discussed earlier. The product RC has units of seconds. (This is
left as an exercise for the student to show.)

EXAMPLE 11–3
For the circuit of Figure 11–11, E  60 V, R  2 k, and
C  25 mF. The switch is closed at t  0 s, opened 40 ms later and left open.
Determine equations for capacitor voltage and current and plot.
Solution
RC  (2 k)(25 mF)  50 ms. As long as the switch is closed
(i.e., from t  0 s to 40 ms), the following equations hold:
vC  E(1  et/RC)  60(1  et/50 ms) V
iC  (E/R)et/RC  30et/50 ms mA
Voltage starts at 0 V and rises exponentially. At t  40 ms, the switch is
opened, interrupting charging. At this instant, vC  60(1  e(40/50))  60(1 
e0.8)  33.0 V. Since the switch is left open, the voltage remains constant at
33 V thereafter as indicated in Figure 11–12. (The dotted curve shows how
the voltage would have kept rising if the switch had remained closed.)
Now consider current. The current starts at 30 mA and decays to iC 
30e(40/50) mA  13.5 mA at t  40 ms. At this point, the switch is opened,
and the current drops instantly to zero. (The dotted line shows how the cur-
rent would have decayed if the switch had not been opened.)

The Time Constant
The rate at which a capacitor charges depends on the product of R and C.
This product is known as the time constant of the circuit and is given the
symbol t (the Greek letter tau). As noted earlier, RC has units of seconds.
Thus,
t  RC
(seconds, s)
(11–6)
Using t, Equations 11–3 to 11–5 can be written as
vC  E(1  et/t)
(11–7)
iC  E
R
et/t
(11–8)
and
vR  Eet/t
(11–9)
Duration of a Transient
The length of time that a transient lasts depends on the exponential func-
tion et/t. As t increases, et/t decreases, and when it reaches zero, the tran-
sient is gone. Theoretically, this takes infinite time. In practice, however,
over 99% of the transition takes place during the first five time constants
(i.e., transients are within 1% of their final value at t  5 t). This can be
verified by direct substitution. At t  5 t, vC  E(1  et/t)  E(1  e5) 
E(1  0.0067)  0.993E, meaning that the transient has achieved 99.3% of
its final value. Similarly, the current falls to within 1% of its final value in
five time constants. Thus, for all practical purposes, transients can be con-
sidered to last for only five time constants (Figure 11–13). Figure 11–14
summarizes how transient voltages and currents are affected by the time
constant of a circuit—the larger the time constant, the longer the duration
of the transient.

Capacitor Discharging Equations
To determine the discharge equations, move the switch to the discharge posi-
tion (Figure 11–18). KVL yields vR  vC  0. Substituting vR  RCdvC /dt
from Section 11.2 yields
RCd
d
v
t
C  vC  0
(11–12)
This can be solved for vC using basic calculus. The result is
vC  V0et/RC
(11–13)
where V0 is the voltage on the capacitor at the instant the switch is moved to
discharge. Now consider the resistor voltage. Since vR  vC  0, vR  vC
and
vR  V0et/RC
(11–14)
Now divide both sides by R. Since iC  iR  vR/R,
iC  V
R
0et/RC
(11–15)
Note that this is negative, since, during discharge, the current is opposite in
direction to the reference arrow of Figure 11–18. (If you need to refresh your
memory, see again Figure 11–5.) Voltage vC and current iC are shown in Fig-
ure 11–19. As in the charging case, discharge transients last five time con-
stants.
In Equations 11–13 to 11–15, V0 represents the voltage on the capacitor
at the instant the switch is moved to the discharge position. If the switch has
been in the charge position long enough for the capacitor to fully charge, V0  E
and Equations 11–13 and 11–15 become vC  Eet/RC and iC  (E/R)et/RC
respectively.

For the circuit of Figure 11–18, assume the capacitor is

pose R  5 k and C  25 mF. After the switch is moved to discharge,
a. Determine the expression for vC.
b. Determine the expression for iC.
c. Compute the voltage and current at 0.375 s.
Solution

a. vC  V0et/RC  100et/0.125  100e8t V.
b. iC  (V0/R)et/RC  20e8t mA.

iC  20e8t mA  20e3 mA  0.996 mA

The universal time constant curve of Figure 11–15(b) may also be used
to solve discharge problems. For example, for the circuit of Example 11–8,
at t  3 t, capacitor voltage has fallen to 4.98% of E, which is (0.0498)(100
V)  4.98 V and current has decayed to 4.98% of 20 mA which is
(0.0498)(20 mA)  0.996 mA. (These agree with Example 11–8 since
3 t was also the value of time used there.)

More Complex Circuits
The charge and discharge equations described previously apply only to cir-
cuits of the forms shown in Figures 11–2 and 11–5 respectively. Fortu-
nately, many circuits can be reduced to these forms using standard circuit
reduction techniques such as series and parallel combinations, source con-
versions, Thévenin’s theorem, and so on. Once a circuit has been reduced
to its series equivalent, you can use any of the equations that we have
developed so far.

PRACTICAL NOTES...
Notes About Time References
1. So far, we have dealt with charging and discharging problems separately.
For these, we define t  0 s as the instant the switch is moved to the
charge position for charging problems and to the discharge position for
discharging problems.
2. When you have both charge and discharge cases in the same example, you
need to establish clearly what you mean by “time.” We use the following
procedure:
a. Define t  0 s as the instant the switch is moved to the first position,
then determine corresponding expressions for vC and iC. These expres-
sions and the corresponding time scale are valid until the switch is
moved to its new position.
b. When the switch is moved to its new position, shift the time reference
and make t  0 s the time at which the switch is moved to its new

Section 11.5 I More Complex Circuits
433
position, then determine corresponding expressions for vC and iC. These
new expressions are only valid from the new t  0 s reference point.
The old expressions are valid only on the old time scale.
c. We now have two time scales for the same graph. However, we gener-
ally only show the first scale explicitly; the second scale is implied
rather than shown.
d. Use tC to represent the time constant for charging and td to represent
the time constant for discharging. Since the equivalent resistance and
capacitance for discharging may be different than that for charging, the
time constants may be different for the two cases.
EXAMPLE 11–11
The capacitor of Figure 11–24(a) is uncharged. The
switch is moved to position 1 for 10 ms, then to position 2, where it remains.
a. Determine vC during charge.
b. Determine iC during charge.
c. Determine vC during discharge.
d. Determine iC during discharge.

Pulse Response of RC Circuits
In previous sections, we looked at the response of RC circuits to switched dc
inputs. In this section, we consider the effect that RC circuits have on pulse
waveforms. Since many electronic devices and systems utilize pulse or rec-
tangular waveforms, including computers, communications systems, and
motor control circuits, these are important considerations.
Pulse Basics
A pulse is a voltage or current that changes from one level to the other and
back again as in Figure 11–34(a) and (b). A pulse train is a repetitive stream
of pulses, as in (c). If a waveform’s high time equals its low time, as in (d), it
is called a square wave.
The length of each cycle of a pulse train is termed its period, T, and the
number of pulses per second is defined as its pulse repetition rate (PRR) or
pulse repetition frequency (PRF). For example, in (e), there are two com-
plete cycles in one second; therefore, the PRR  2 pulses/s. With two cycles
every second, the time for one cycle is T  1⁄2 s. Note that this is 1/PRR.
This is true in general. That is,
T  
PR

The width, tp, of a pulse relative to its period, [Figure 11–34(c)] is its
duty cycle. Thus,

(11–17)
A square wave [Figure 11–34(d)] therefore has a 50% duty cycle, while a
waveform with tp  1.5 ms and a period of 10 ms has a duty cycle of 15%.

the circuit in the box is shown in (b). Determine expressions for vC and iC.
The capacitor is initially uncharged.

In practice, waveforms are not ideal, that is, they do not change from
low to high or high to low instantaneously. Instead, they have finite rise and
fall times. Rise and fall times are denoted as tr and tf and are measured
between the 10% and 90% points as indicated in Figure 11–35(a). Pulse
width is measured at the 50% point. The difference between a real wave-
form and an ideal waveform is often slight. For example, rise and fall times
of real pulses may be only a few nanoseconds and when viewed on an oscil-
loscope, as in Figure 11–35(b), appear to be ideal. In what follows, we will
assume ideal waveforms.

The Effect of Pulse Width
The width of a pulse relative to a circuit’s time constant determines how it is
affected by an RC circuit. Consider Figure 11–36. In (a), the circuit has been
drawn to focus on the voltage across C; in (b), it has been drawn to focus on
the voltage across R. (Otherwise, the circuits are identical.) An easy way to
visualize the operation of these circuits is to assume that the pulse is gener-
ated by a switch that is moved rapidly back and forth between V and com-
mon as in (c). This alternately creates a charge and discharge circuit, and
thus all of the ideas developed in this chapter apply directly.

First, consider the ouput of circuit (a). When the pulse width and time
between pulses are very long compared with the circuit time constant, the
capacitor charges and discharges fully, Figure 11–37(b). (This case is similar
to what we have already seen in this chapter.) Note, that charging and dis-
charging occur at the transitions of the pulse. The transients therefore
increase the rise and fall times of the output. In high-speed circuits, this may
be a problem. (You will learn more about this in your digital electronics
courses.)

EXAMPLE 11–16
A square wave is applied to the input of Figure 11–36(a).
If R  1 k and C  100 pF, estimate the rise and fall time of the output sig-
nal using the universal time constant curve of Figure 11–15(a).
Solution
Here, t  RC  (1  103)(100  1012)  100 ns. From Figure
11–15(a), note that vC reaches the 10% point at about 0.1 t, which is (0.1)(100
ns)  10 ns. The 90% point is reached at about 2.3 t, which is (2.3)(100 ns) 
230 ns. The rise time is therefore approximately 230 ns  10 ns  220 ns. The
fall time will be the same.
Now consider the circuit in Figure 11–36(b). Here, current iC will be
similar to that of Figure 11–27(b), except that the pulse widths will be nar-
rower. Since voltage vR  R iC, the output will be a series of short, sharp
spikes that occur at input transitions as in Figure 11–37(c). Under the condi-
tions here (i.e., pulse width much greater than the circuit time constant), vR is

an approximation to the derivative of vin and the circuit is called a differen-
tiator circuit. Such circuits have important practical uses.
Pulse Width tp  5 
These waveforms are shown in Figure 11–38. Since the pulse width is 5t,
the capacitor fully charges and discharges during each pulse. Thus wave-
forms here will be similar to what we have seen previously.
Pulse Width tp  5 
This case differs from what we have seen so far in this chapter only in that the
capacitor does not have time to charge and discharge significantly between
pulses. The result is that switching occurs on the early (nearly straight line)
part of the charging and discharging curves and thus, vC is roughly triangular
in shape, Figure 11–39(a). As shown below, it has an average value of V/2.
Under the conditions here, vC is the approximate integral of vin and the circuit
is called an integrator circuit.
It should be noted that vC does not reach the steady state shown in Fig-
ure 11–39 immediately. Instead, it works its way up over a period of five
time constants (Figure 11–40). To illustrate, assume an input square wave of
5 V with a pulse width of 0.1 s and t  0.1 s.
Section 11.7 I Pulse Response of RC Circuits
443
Pulse 1:
vC  E(1  et/t). At the end of the first pulse (t  0.1 s), vC has
climbed to vC  5(1  e0.1/0.1)  5(1  e1)  3.16 V. From the end of
pulse 1 to the beginning of pulse 2 (i.e., over an interval of 0.1 s), vC decays
from 3.16 V to 3.16e0.1/0.1  3.16e1  1.16 V.
Pulse 2:
vC starts at 1.16 V and 0.1 s later has a value of vC  E  (V0 
E)et/t  5  (1.16  5)e0.1/0.1  5  3.84e1  3.59 V. It then decays to
3.59e1  1.32 V over the next 0.1 s.
Continuing in this manner, the remaining values for Figure 11–40(b) are
determined. After 5 t, vC cycles between 1.34 and 3.65 V, with an average of
(1.34  3.65)/2  2.5 V, or half the input pulse amplitude.

Verify the remaining points of Figure 11–40(b).
Capacitive Loading
Capacitance occurs whenever conductors are separated by insulating mater-
ial. This means that capacitance exists between wires in cables, between
traces on printed circuit boards, and so on. In general, this capacitance is
undesirable but it cannot be avoided. It is called stray capacitance. Fortu-
nately, stray capacitance is often so small that it can be neglected. However,
in high-speed circuits, it may cause problems.
To illustrate, consider Figure 11–41. The electronic driver of (a) pro-
duces square pulses. However, when it drives a long line as in (b), stray
capacitance loads it and increases the signal’s rise and fall times (since
capacitance takes time to charge and discharge). If the rise and fall times
become excessively long, the signal reaching the load may be so degraded
that the system malfunctions. (Capacitive loading is a serious issue but we
will leave it for future courses to deal with.)
11.8
Transient Analysis Using Computers
Electronics Workbench and PSpice are well suited for studying transients
as they both incorporate easy to use graphing facilities that you can use to
plot results directly on the screen. When plotting transients, you must
specify the time scale for your plot—i.e., the length of time that you
expect the transient to last. A good value to start with is 5 t where t is
the time constant of the circuit. (For complex circuits, if you do not know
t, make an estimate, run a simulation, adjust the time scale, and repeat
until you get an acceptable plot.)
Electronics Workbench
Workbench provides two ways to view waveforms—via its oscilloscope or
via its analysis graphing facility. Since the analysis graphing facility is easier
to use and yields better output, we will begin with it. (In Chapter 14, we
introduce the oscilloscope.) As a first example, consider the RC charging cir-
cuit of Figure 11–42. Determine capacitor voltage at t  50 ms and t  150
ms. (You don’t need a switch; you simply tell Workbench to perform a tran-
sient analysis.)
Proceed as follows:
• Create the circuit of Figure 11–42 on the screen. (To display node number-
ing, select Circuit/Schematic Options, enable Show Nodes, then click OK).
• Select Analysis/Transient and in the dialog box, click Initial Conditions
Set to Zero. Set End Time (TSTOP) to 0.25, highlight Node 2 (to display
the voltage across the capacitor), then click on Add.
• Click Simulate. When the analysis is finished, the graph of Figure 11–
43(b) should appear. Click the Toggle Grid icon on the Analysis Graphs
menu bar. Expand to full screen.

which you want to read voltages.
Analysis of Results
As indicated in Figure 11–43(a), vC  6.32 V at t  50 ms and 9.50 V at t 
150 ms. (Check by substitution into vC  10(1  e20t). You will find that
results agree exactly.)
1. Be careful when connecting
multiple lines to a node or
Workbench may cause a line
to be dropped. For example,
in Figure 11–42 be sure that
the ground is actually con-
nected, not simply butted up
against the bottom wire. If
you have trouble, go to the
Basic Parts bin, get a connec-
tor dot, (•) and use it to make
the connection.
2. A shorthand notation is used
here. For example, “select
Circuit/Schematic Options”
means to click Circuit on the
toolbar and select “Schematic
Options” from the drop-down
menu that appears.

Initial Conditions in Electronics Workbench
Let us change the above problem to include an initial voltage of 20 V on the
capacitor. Get the circuit of Fig. 11–42 back on the screen, click the Basic
Parts bin icon, drag the connector dot (●) and insert it into the circuit wiring
slightly above the capacitor. Double click the dot and in the Connector Prop-
erties box that opens, click Use Initial Conditions, type 20 into the Transient
Analysis (IC) box, then click OK. Click Analysis, Transient and under Initial
Conditions, click User-Defined, select the capacitor node voltage for display,
then click Simulate. Note that the transient starts at 20 V and decays to its
steady state value of 10 V in five time constants as expected.
Another Example
Using the clock source from the Sources bin, build the circuit of Figure 11–
44. (The clock, with its default settings, produces a square wave that cycles

between 0 V and 5 V with a cycle length of T  1 ms.) This means that its
on time tp is T/2  500 ms. Since the time constant of Figure 11–44 is t 
RC  50 ms, tp is greater than 5t and a waveform similar to that of Figure
11–37(c) should result. To verify, follow the procedure of the previous exam-
ple, except set End Time (TSTOP) to 0.0025 in the Analysis/Transient dialog
box. The waveform of Figure 11–45 appears. Note that output spikes occur
on the transitions of the input waveform as predicted.
OrCAD PSpice
As a first example, consider Figure 11–2 with R  200 , C  50 mF and
E  40 V. Let the capacitor be initially uncharged (i.e., Vo  0 V). First, read
the PSpice Operational Notes, then proceed as follows:
• Create the circuit on the screen as in Figure 11–46. (The switch can be
found in the EVAL library as part Sw_tClose.) Remember to rotate the
capacitor three times as discussed in Appendix A, then set its initial condi-
tion (IC) to zero. To do this, double click the capacitor symbol, type 0V
into the Property editor cell labeled IC, click Apply, then close the editor.
Click the New Simulation Profile icon, enter a name (e.g., Figure 11–47)
then click Create. In the Simulation Settings box, click the Analysis tab,
select Time Domain (Transient) and in Options, select General Settings.
Set the duration of the transient (TSTOP) to 50ms (i.e., five time con-
stants). Find the voltage marker on the toolbar and place as shown.
Section 11.8 I Transient Analysis Using Computers
447
PSpice Operational Notes
1. Do not use a space between a
value and its unit. Thus, use
50ms, not 50 ms, etc.
2. When instructed to enter data
via a Properties editor, first
click the Parts tab at the bot-
tom of the screen; scroll right
until you find the cell that
you want, and then type in its
value.
3. Sometimes you get choppy
waveforms. If this happens,
enter a suitable value for
Maximum step size in the
Simulation Profile box. If
you make the value too large,
the waveform will be choppy,
while if you make it too
small, simulation time will be
too lengthy. Values usually
aren’t critical, but you may
need to experiment a bit. (To
illustrate, you can smooth the
waveforms of Figure 11–47
using a Maximum step size
of 10us, and the curves of
Figure 11–50 with a step size
of 20ms.)
4. For transient problems you
need to specify an initial con-
dition (IC) for each capacitor
and inductor. The procedure
is described in the examples.
5. To activate the icons used for
adding and viewing wave-
forms in these examples, you
may need to set up additional
toolbar icons. Proceed as fol-
lows: When the display of
Figure 11–47 appears, click
Tools, Customize, select the
Toolbars tab, select all tool-
bars shown, i.e., File, Edit,
Simulate, Probe and Cursor,
then click OK. Position the
pointer over various icons to
note their function.
NOTES...
FIGURE 11–46
PSpice example. The voltage marker displays voltage with respect to
ground, which, in this case, is the voltage across C1.
• Click the Run icon. When simulation is complete, a trace of capacitor volt-
age versus time (the green trace of Figure 11–47) appears. Click Plot (on
the toolbar) then add Y Axis to create the second axis. Activate the addi-
tional toolbar icons described in Operational Note 5, then click the Add
Trace icon on the new toolbar. In the dialog box, click I(C1) (assuming
your capacitor is designated C1), then OK. This adds the current trace.

Analysis of Results
Click the Toggle cursor icon, then use the cursor to determine values from the
screen. For example, at t  5 ms, you should find vC  15.7 V and iC  121
mA. (An analytic solution for this circuit (which is Figure 11–23) may be
found in Example 11–10, part (c). It agrees exactly with the PSpice solution.)
As a second example, consider the circuit of Figure 11–21 (shown as
Figure 11–48). Create the circuit using the same general procedure as in the
previous example, except do not rotate the capacitor. Again, be sure to set V0
(the initial capacitor voltage) to zero. In the Simulation Profile box, set
TSTOP to 50ms. Place differential voltage markers (found on the toolbar at
the top of the screen) across C to graph the capacitor voltage. Run the analy-
sis, create a second axis, then add the current plot. You should get the same
graph (i.e., Figure 11–47) as you got for the previous example, since its cir-
cuit is the Thévenin equivalent of this one.

EXAMPLE 11–17
The capacitor of Figure 11–49(a) has an initial voltage of
10 V. The switch is moved to the charge position for 1 s, then to the dis-
charge position where it remains. Determine curves for vC and iC.
Solution
PSpice has no switch that implements the above switching
sequence. However, moving the switch first to charge then to discharge is
equivalent to placing 20 V across the RC combination for the charge time,
then 0 V thereafter as indicated in (b). You can do this with a pulse source
(VPULSE) as indicated in (c). (VPULSE is found in the SOURCE library.)
To set pulse parameters, double click the VPULSE symbol, then scroll its
Property editor as described in the Operational Notes until you find a group
of cells labeled PER, PW, etc. Enter 5s for PER, 1s for PW, 1us for TF, 1us

required delay is 67 ms 18 ms. You test a number of units as they come off
the production line and find that some do not meet the timing spec. Perform a
design review and determine the cause. Redesign the timing portion of the

any common devices rely on magnetism. Familiar examples include com-
puter disk drives, tape recorders, VCRs, transformers, motors, generators,
and so on. To understand their operation, you need a knowledge of magnetism
and magnetic circuit principles. In this chapter, we look at fundamentals of mag-
netism, relationships between electrical and magnetic quantities, magnetic cir-
cuit concepts, and methods of analysis. In Chapter 13, we look at electromag-
netic induction and inductance, and in Chapter 24, we apply magnetic principles
to the study of transformers.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Magnetism and Electromagnetism
WHILE THE BASIC FACTS about magnetism have been known since ancient times,
it was not until the early 1800s that the connection between electricity and mag-
netism was made and the foundations of modern electromagnetic theory laid
down.
In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish scientist, demonstrated that elec-
tricity and magnetism were related when he showed that a compass needle was
deflected by a current-carrying conductor. The following year, Andre Ampere
(1775–1836) showed that current-carrying conductors attract or repel each other
just like magnets. However, it was Michael Faraday (recall Chapter 10) who
developed our present concept of the magnetic field as a collection of flux lines
in space that conceptually represent both the intensity and the direction of the
field. It was this concept that led to an understanding of magnetism and the
development of important practical devices such as the transformer and the elec-
tric generator.
In 1873, James Clerk Maxwell (see photo), a Scottish scientist, tied the then
known theoretical and experimental concepts together and developed a unified
theory of electromagnetism that predicted the existence of radio waves. Some 30
years later, Heinrich Hertz, a German physcist, showed experimentally that such
waves existed, thus verifying Maxwell’s theories and paving the way for modern
radio and television.

12.1
The Nature of a Magnetic Field
Magnetism refers to the force that acts between magnets and magnetic mate-
rials. We know, for example, that magnets attract pieces of iron, deflect com-
pass needles, attract or repel other magnets, and so on. This force acts at a
distance and without the need for direct physical contact. The region where
the force is felt is called the “field of the magnet” or simply, its magnetic
field. Thus, a magnetic field is a force field.
Magnetic Flux
Faraday’s flux concept (recall Putting It Into Perspective, Chapter 10) helps us
visualize this field. Using Faraday’s representation, magnetic fields are shown
as lines in space. These lines, called flux lines or lines of force, show the
direction and intensity of the field at all points.This is illustrated in Figure 12–1
for the field of a bar magnet. As indicated, the field is strongest at the poles of
the magnet (where flux lines are most dense), its direction is from north (N) to
south (S) external to the magnet, and flux lines never cross. The symbol for
magnetic flux (Figure 12–1) is the Greek letter  (phi).
462
Chapter 12 I Magnetism and Magnetic Circuits
Flux is perhaps an unfortunate
name to apply to a magnetic
field. Flux suggests a flow, but
in a magnetic field, nothing
actually flows; a magnetic field
is simply a condition of space,
i.e., a region in which magnetic
force exists. Nonetheless, the
concept of flux is enormously
helpful as an aid to visualizing
magnetic phenomenon, and we
will continue to use it for that
purpose.

together. In (a), unlike poles attract, and flux lines pass from one magnet to
the other. In (b), like poles repel, and the flux lines are pushed back as indi-

Ferromagnetic Materials
Magnetic materials (materials that are attracted by magnets such as iron,
nickel, cobalt, and their alloys) are called ferromagnetic materials. Ferro-
magnetic materials provide an easy path for magnetic flux. This is illustrated

in Figure 12–3 where the flux lines take the longer (but easier) path through
the soft iron, rather than the shorter path that they would normally take
(recall Figure 12–1). Note, however, that nonmagnetic materials (plastic,
wood, glass, and so on) have no effect on the field.
Figure 12–4 shows an application of these principles. Part (a) shows a
simplified representation of a loudspeaker, and part (b) shows expanded

details of its magnetic field. (Since the speaker is symmetrical, only half
its structure is shown in (b).) The field is created by the permanent mag-
net, and the iron pole pieces guide the field and concentrate it in the gap
where the speaker coil is placed. (For a description of how the speaker
works, see Section 12.4.) Within the iron structure, the flux crowds
together at sharp interior corners, spreads apart at exterior corners, and is
essentially uniform elsewhere. This is characteristic of magnetic fields in
iron.
12.2
Electromagnetism
Most applications of magnetism involve magnetic effects due to electric
currents. We look first at some basic principles. Consider Figure 12–5.
The current, I, creates a magnetic field that is concentric about the con-
ductor, uniform along its length, and whose strength is directly propor-
tional to I. Note the direction of the field. It may be remembered with the
aid of the right-hand rule. As indicated in (b), imagine placing your
right hand around the conductor with your thumb pointing in the direction
of current. Your fingers then point in the direction of the field. If you
reverse the direction of the current, the direction of the field reverses. If
the conductor is wound into a coil, the fields of its individual turns com-
bine, producing a resultant field as in Figure 12–6. The direction of the
coil flux can also be remembered by means of a simple rule: curl the fin-
gers of your right hand around the coil in the direction of the current and
your thumb will point in the direction of the field. If the direction of the
current is reversed, the field also reverses. Provided no ferromagnetic
material is present, the strength of the coil’s field is directly proportional
to its current.

FIGURE 12–6

If the coil is wound on a ferromagnetic core as in Figure 12–7 (trans-
formers are built this way), almost all flux is confined to the core, although a
small amount (called stray or leakage flux) passes through the surrounding
air. However, now that ferromagnetic material is present, the core flux is no
longer proportional to current. The reason for this is discussed in Section
12.14.

12.3
Flux and Flux Density
As noted in Figure 12–1, magnetic flux is represented by the symbol . In
the SI system, the unit of flux is the weber (Wb), in honor of pioneer
researcher Wilhelm Eduard Weber, 1804–1891. However, we are often more
interested in flux density B (i.e., flux per unit area) than in total flux .
Since flux  is measured in Wb and area A in m2, flux density is measured
as Wb/m2. However, to honor Nikola Tesla (another early researcher, 1856–
1943) the unit of flux density is called the tesla (T) where 1 T  1 Wb/m2.
Flux density is found by dividing the total flux passing perpendicularly
through an area by the size of the area, Figure 12–8. That is,
B  
A

(tesla, T)

Thus, if   600 mWb of flux pass perpendicularly through an area A  20 
104 m2, the flux density is B  (600  106 Wb)/(20  104 m2)  0.3 T.
The greater the flux density, the stronger the field.

For ferromagnetic materials, most flux is confined to the core.

To gain a feeling for the size of magnetic units, note that the strength of
the earth’s field is approximately 50 mT near the earth’s surface, the field of a
large generator or motor is on the order of 1 or 2 T, and the largest fields yet
produced (using superconducting magnets) are on the order of 25 T.
Other systems of units (now largely superseded) are the CGS system and
the English systems. In the CGS system, flux is measured in maxwells and
flux density in gauss. In the English system, flux is measured in lines and
flux density in lines per square inch. Conversion factors are given in Table

Magnetic Circuits
Most practical applications of magnetism use magnetic structures to guide
and shape magnetic fields by providing a well-defined path for flux. Such
structures are called magnetic circuits. Magnetic circuits are found in
motors, generators, computer disk drives, tape recorders, and so on. The
speaker of Figure 12–4 illustrates the concept. It uses a powerful magnet to
create flux and an iron circuit to guide the flux to the air gap to provide the
intense field required by the voice coil. Note how effectively it does its job;
almost the entire flux produced by the magnet is confined to the iron path
with little leakage into the air.
A second example is shown in Figures 12–10 and 12–11. Tape recorders,
VCRs, and computer disk drives all store information magnetically on iron
oxide coated surfaces for later retrieval and use. The basic tape recorder
scheme is shown symbolically in Figure 12–10. Sound picked up by a
microphone is converted to an electrical signal, amplified, and the output
applied to the record head. The record head is a small magnetic circuit. Cur-
rent from the amplifier passes through its coil, creating a magnetic field that
magnetizes the moving tape. The magnetized patterns on the tape correspond
to the original sound input.

The recording head of a tape recorder is a magnetic circuit.
During playback the magnetized tape is passed by a playback head, as
shown in Figure 12–11(a). Voltages induced in the playback coil are ampli-
fied and applied to a speaker. The speaker (b) utilizes a flexible cone to
reproduce sound. A coil of fine wire attached at the apex of this cone is
placed in the field of the speaker air gap. Current from the amplifier passes
through this coil, creating a varying field that interacts with the fixed field of

the speaker magnet, causing the cone to vibrate. Since these vibrations corre-
spond to the magnetized patterns on the tape, the original sound is repro-
duced. Computer disk drives use a similar record/playback scheme; in this
case, binary logic patterns are stored and retrieved rather than music and
voice.
12.5
Air Gaps, Fringing, and Laminated Cores
For magnetic circuits with air gaps, fringing occurs, causing a decrease in
flux density in the gap as in Figure 12–12(a). For short gaps, fringing can
usually be neglected. Alternatively, correction can be made by increasing
each cross-sectional dimension of the gap by the size of the gap to approxi-
mate the decrease in flux density.

Now consider laminations. Many practical magnetic circuits (such as
transformers) use thin sheets of stacked iron or steel as in Figure 12–12(b).
Since the core is not a solid block, its effective cross-sectional area (i.e., the
actual area of iron) is less than its physical area. A stacking factor, defined
as the ratio of the actual area of ferrous material to the physical area of the
core, permits you to determine the core’s effective area.

Series Elements and Parallel Elements
Magnetic circuits may have sections of different materials. For example, the
circuit of Figure 12–13 has sections of cast iron, sheet steel, and an air gap.
For this circuit, flux  is the same in all sections. Such a circuit is called a
series magnetic circuit. Although the flux is the same in all sections, the
flux density in each section may vary, depending on its effective cross-sec-
tional area as you saw earlier.

12.7
Magnetic Circuits with DC Excitation
We now look at the analysis of magnetic circuits with dc excitation. There
are two basic problems to consider: (1) given the flux, to determine the cur-
rent required to produce it and (2) given the current, to compute the flux pro-
duced. To help visualize how to solve such problems, we first establish an
analogy between magnetic circuits and electric circuits.
MMF: The Source of Magnetic Flux
Current through a coil creates magnetic flux. The greater the current or the
greater the number of turns, the greater will be the flux. This flux-producing
ability of a coil is called its magnetomotive force (mmf). Magnetomotive
force is given the symbol  and is defined as
  NI
(ampere-turns, At)
(12–2)
Thus, a coil with 100 turns and 2.5 amps will have an mmf of 250 ampere-
turns, while a coil with 500 turns and 4 amps will have an mmf of 2000
ampere-turns.
Reluctance, : Opposition to Magnetic Flux
Flux in a magnetic circuit also depends on the opposition that the circuit pre-
sents to it. Termed reluctance, this opposition depends on the dimensions of
the core and the material of which it is made. Like the resistance of a wire,
reluctance is directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to
cross-sectional area. In equation form,
  m

A

(At/Wb)
(12–3)
where m is a property of the core material called its permeability (discussed
in Section 12.8). Permeability is a measure of how easy it is to establish flux
in a material. Ferromagnetic materials have high permeability and hence low
, while nonmagnetic materials have low permeability and high .

Ohm’s Law for Magnetic Circuits
The relationship between flux, mmf, and reluctance is
  /
(Wb)
(12–4)
This relationship is similar to Ohm’s law and is depicted symbolically in
Figure 12–15. (Remember however that flux, unlike electric current, does
not flow—see note in Section 12.1.)

For Figure 12–16, if the reluctance of the magnetic circuit

N = 300 turns
In Example 12–3, we assumed that the reluctance of the core was con-
stant. This is only approximately true under certain conditions. In general, it is
not true, since  is a function of flux density. Thus Equation 12–4 is not really
very useful, since for ferromagnetic material,  depends on flux, the very
quantity that you are trying to find. The main use of Equations 12–3 and 12–4
is to provide an analogy between electric and magnetic circuit analysis.
12.8
Magnetic Field Intensity and Magnetization Curves
We now look at a more practical approach to analyzing magnetic circuits.
First, we require a quantity called magnetic field intensity, H (also known as
magnetizing force). It is a measure of the mmf per unit length of a circuit.
To get at the idea, suppose you apply the same mmf (say 600 At) to two
circuits with different path lengths (Figure 12–17). In (a), you have 600
ampere-turns of mmf to “drive” flux through 0.6 m of core; in (b), you have
the same mmf but it is spread across only 0.15 m of path length. Thus the
mmf per unit length in the second case is more intense. Based on this idea,
one can define magnetic field intensity as the ratio of applied mmf to the
length of path that it acts over. Thus,
H  /  NI/
(At/m)
(12–5)
For the circuit of Figure 12–17(a), H  600 At/0.6 m  1000 At/m, while
for the circuit of (b), H  600 At/0.15  4000 At/m. Thus, in (a) you have

(b) A short path

By definition, H 

1000 ampere-turns of “driving force” per meter of length to establish flux in
the core, whereas in (b) you have four times as much. (However, you won’t
get four times as much flux, since the opposition to flux varies with the den-
sity of the flux.)
Rearranging Equation 12–5 yields an important result:
NI  H
(At)
(12–6)
In an analogy with electric circuits (Figure 12–18), the NI product is an mmf
source, while the H product is an mmf drop.
The Relationship between B and H
From Equation 12–5, you can see that magnetizing force, H, is a measure of
the flux-producing ability of the coil (since it depends on NI). You also know
that B is a measure of the resulting flux (since B  /A). Thus, B and H are
related. The relationship is
B  mH
(12–7)
where m is the permeability of the core (recall Equation 12–3).
It was stated earlier that permeability is a measure of how easy it is to
establish flux in a material. To see why, note from Equation 12–7 that the
larger the value of m, the larger the flux density for a given H. However, H is
proportional to current; therefore, the larger the value of m, the larger the
flux density for a given magnetizing current. From this, it follows that the
larger the permeability, the more flux you get for a given magnetizing cur-
rent.
In the SI system, m has units of webers per ampere-turn-meter. The per-
meability of free space is m0  4p  107. For all practical purposes, the
permeability of air and other nonmagnetic materials is the same as for a vac-
uum. Thus, in air gaps,

Answer: 1.81 mWb
B-H Curves
For ferromagnetic materials, m is not constant but varies with flux density
and there is no easy way to compute it. In reality, however, it isn’t m that you
are interested in: What you really want to know is, given B, what is H, and
vice versa. A set of curves, called B-H or magnetization curves, provides this
information. (These curves are obtained experimentally and are available in

handbooks. A separate curve is required for each material.) Figure 12–19
shows typical curves for cast iron, cast steel, and sheet steel.

Ampere’s Circuital Law
One of the key relationships in magnetic circuit theory is Ampere’s cir-
cuital law. Ampere’s law was determined experimentally and is a generaliza-
tion of the relationship   NI  H that we developed earlier. Ampere
showed that the algebraic sum of mmfs around a closed loop in a magnetic
circuit is zero, regardless of the number of sections or coils. That is,

  0
(12–10)
This can be rewrittten as

NI  
H
At
(12–11)
which states that the sum of applied mmfs around a closed loop equals the
sum of the mmf drops. The summation is algebraic and terms are additive or
subtractive, depending on the direction of flux and how the coils are wound.
To illustrate, consider again Figure 12–13. Here,
NI  Hironiron  Hsteelsteel  Hgg  0
Thus,
NI  Hironiron  Hsteelsteel  Hgg
Impressed
sum of mmf drops
mmf
which states that the applied mmf NI is equal to the sum of the H drops
around the loop. The path to use for the H terms is the mean (average) path.
You now have two magnetic circuit models (Figure 12–21). While the
reluctance model (a) is not very useful for solving problems, it helps relate
magnetic circuit problems to familiar electrical circuit concepts. The
Ampere’s law model, on the other hand, permits us to solve practical prob-
lems. We look at how to do this in the next section.

You now have the tools needed to solve basic magnetic circuit problems. We

2. Determine H for each magnetic section from the B-H curves. Use Hg 

PRACTICAL NOTES...
Magnetic circuit analysis is not as precise as electric circuit analysis because
(1) the assumption of uniform flux density breaks down at sharp corners as
you saw in Figure 12–4, and (2) the B-H curve is a mean curve and has con-
siderable uncertainty as discussed later (Section 12–14).
Although the answers are approximate, they are adequate for most pur-
poses.

More Examples
If a magnetic circuit contains an air gap, add another element to the concep-
tual models (recall Figure 12–21). Since air represents a poor magnetic path,
its reluctance will be high compared with that of iron. Recalling our analogy
to electric circuits, this suggests that the mmf drop across the gap will be large
compared with that of the iron. You can see this in the following example.

Solution
From the previous example, you know that a current of 0.78 amps
in coil 1 produces   0.1  103 Wb. But you already have 1.5 amps in coil
1. Thus, coil 2 must be wound in opposition so that its mmf is subtractive.

12.12 Series Magnetic Circuits: Given NI, Find 
In previous problems, you were given the flux and asked to find the current.
We now look at the converse problem: given NI, find the resultant flux. For
the special case of a core of one material and constant cross section (Exam-
ple 12–11) this is straightforward. For all other cases, trial and error must be
used.

For circuits with two or more sections, the process is not so simple.
Before you can find H in any section, for example, you need to know the
flux density. However, in order to determine flux density, you need to know
H. Thus, neither  nor H can be found without knowing the other first.
To get around this problem, use trial and error. First, take a guess at the
value for flux, compute NI using the 4-step procedure of Section 12.10, then
compare the computed NI against the given NI. If they agree, the problem is
solved. If they don’t, adjust your guess and try again. Repeat the procedure
until you are within 5% of the given NI.
The problem is how to come up with a good first guess. For circuits of
the type of Figure 12–32, note that NI  Hsteelsteel  Hgg. As a first guess,
assume that the reluctance of the air gap is so high that the full mmf drop
appears across the gap. Thus, NI  Hgg, and
Hg  NI/g
(12–12)
You can now apply Ampere’s law to see how close to the given NI your trial
guess is.
Since we know that some of the mmf drop appears across the steel, we
will start at less than 100% for the gap. Common sense and a bit of experi-
ence helps. The relative size of the mmf drops also depends on the core
material. For cast iron, the percentage drop across the iron is larger than the

EXAMPLE 12–12
The core of Figure 12–32 is cast steel, NI  1100 At,
and the cross-sectional area everywhere is 0.0025 m2. Determine the flux in
the core.
Solution
Initial Guess
Assume that 90% of the mmf appears across the gap. The applied mmf is
1100 At. Ninety percent of this is 990 At. Thus, Hg  0.9NI/  990/0.002 
4.95  105 At/m and Bg  m0Hg  (4p  107)(4.95  105)  0.62 T.
Trial 1
Since the area of the steel is the same as that of the gap, the flux density is the
same, neglecting fringing. Thus, Bsteel  Bg  0.62 T. From the B-H curve,
Hsteel  400 At/m. Now apply Ampere’s law:
NI  Hsteelsteel  Hgg  (400)(0.2)  (4.95  105)(0.002)
 80  990  1070 At
This answer is 2.7% lower than the given NI of 1100 At and is therefore
acceptable. Thus,   BA  0.62  0.0025  1.55  103 Wb.
The initial guess in Example 12–12 yielded an acceptable answer on the
first trial. (You are seldom this lucky.)
EXAMPLE 12–13
If the core of Figure 12–32 is cast iron instead of steel,
compute .
Solution
Because cast iron has a larger H for a given flux density (Figure
12–19), it will have a larger H drop and less will appear across the gap.
Assume 75% across the gap.
Initial Guess
Hg  0.75 NI/  (0.75)(1100)/0.002  4.125  105 At/m.

(high by 5.9%)
Trial 2
Reduce the guess by 5.9% to Biron  0.49 T. Thus, Hiron  1500 At/m (from
the B-H curve) and Hg  7.96  105 Bg  3.90  105 At/m.

Figure 12–34 shows how a relay is used in practice. When the switch is
closed, the energized coil pulls the armature down. This closes the contacts
and energizes the load. When the switch is opened, the spring pulls the con-
tacts open again. Schemes like this use relatively small currents to control
large loads. In addition, they permit remote control, as the relay and load
may be a considerable distance from the actuating switch.

12.14 Properties of Magnetic Materials
Magnetic properties are related to atomic structure. Each atom of a sub-
stance, for example, produces a tiny atomic-level magnetic field because its
moving (i.e., orbiting) electrons constitute an atomic-level current and cur-
rents create magnetic fields. For nonmagnetic materials, these fields are
randomly oriented and cancel. However, for ferromagnetic materials, the
fields in small regions, called domains (Figure 12–35), do not cancel.
(Domains are of microscopic size, but are large enough to hold from 1017
to 1021 atoms.) If the domain fields in a ferromagnetic material line up, the
material is magnetized; if they are randomly oriented, the material is not
magnetized.
Magnetizing a Specimen
A nonmagnetized specimen can be magnetized by making its domain fields
line up. Figure 12–36 shows how this can be done. As current through the
coil is increased, the field strength increases and more and more domains

material
FIGURE 12–35

of microscopic fields in a nonmagne-
tized ferromagnetic material. The small
regions are called domains.

align themselves in the direction of the field. If the field is made strong
enough, almost all domain fields line up and the material is said to be in sat-
uration (the almost flat portion of the B-H curve). In saturation, the flux
density increases slowly as magnetization intensity increases. This means
that once the material is in saturation, you cannot magnetize it much further
no matter how hard you try. Path 0-a traced from the nonmagnetized state to
the saturated state is termed the dc curve or normal magnetization curve.
(This is the B-H curve that you used earlier when you solved magnetic cir-
cuit problems.)

Hysteresis
If you now reduce the current to zero, you will find that the material still
retains some magnetism, called residual magnetism (Figure 12–37, point
b). If now you reverse the current, the flux reverses and the bottom part of
the curve can be traced. By reversing the current again at d, the curve can be
traced back to point a. The result is called a hysteresis loop. A major source
of uncertainty in magnetic circuit behavior should now be apparent: As you
can see, flux density depends not just on current, it also depends on which
arm of the curve the sample is magnetized on, i.e., it depends on the circuit’s
past history. For this reason, B-H curves are the average of the two arms of
the hysteresis loop, i.e., the dc curve of Figure 12–36.
The Demagnetization Process
As indicated above, simply turning the current off does not demagnetize fer-
romagnetic material. To demagnetize it, you must successively decrease its
hysteresis loop to zero as in Figure 12–38. You can place the specimen inside
a coil that is driven by a variable ac source and gradually decrease the coil
current to zero, or you can use a fixed ac supply and gradually withdraw the
specimen from the field. Such procedures are used by service personnel to
“degauss” TV picture tubes.

12.15 Measuring Magnetic Fields
One way to measure magnetic field strength is to use the Hall effect (after E.
H. Hall). The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 12–39. When a strip of semi-
conductor material such as indium arsenide is placed in a magnetic field, a
small voltage, called the Hall voltage, VH, appears across opposite edges. For
a fixed current I, VH is proportional to magnetic field strength B. Instruments
using this principle are known as Hall-effect gaussmeters. To measure a
magnetic field with such a meter, insert its probe into the field perpendicular
to the field (Figure 12–40). The meter indicates flux density directly.

n this chapter, we look at self-inductance and inductors. Self-inductance (usu-
ally just called inductance) is a circuit property that is due entirely to the mag-
netic field created by current in a circuit. The effect that inductance has on cir-
cuit operation is to oppose any change in current—thus, in a sense, inductance
can be likened to inertia in a mechanical system.
A circuit element built to possess inductance is called an inductor. In its
simplest form an inductor is simply a coil of wire, Figure 13–1(a). Ideally,
inductors have only inductance. However, since they are made of wire, practical
inductors also have some resistance. Initially, however, we assume that this resis-
tance is negligible and treat inductors as ideal (i.e., we assume that they have no
property other than inductance). (Coil resistance is considered in Sections 13.6
and 13.7.) In practice, inductors are also referred to as chokes (because they try
to limit or “choke” current change), or as reactors (for reasons to be discussed in
Chapter 16). In this chapter, we refer to them mainly as inductors.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
FIGURE 13–1
Inductance is due to the magnetic field created by an electric current.
On circuit diagrams and in equations, inductance is represented by the letter
L. Its circuit symbol is a coil as shown in Figure 13–1(b). The unit of inductance
is the henry.
Inductors are used in many places. In radios, they are part of the tuning cir-
cuit that you adjust when you select a station. In fluorescent lamps, they are part
of the ballast circuit that limits current when the lamp is turned on; in power sys-
tems, they are part of the protection circuitry used to control short-circuit cur-
rents during fault conditions.

13.1
Electromagnetic Induction
Since inductance depends on induced voltage, we begin with a review of
electromagnetic induction. First, we look at Faraday’s and Henry’s results.
Consider Figure 13–2. In (a), a magnet is moved through a coil of wire,
and this action induces a voltage in the coil. When the magnet is thrust into
the coil, the meter deflects upscale; when it is withdrawn, the meter
deflects downscale, indicating that polarity has changed. The voltage mag-
nitude is proportional to how fast the magnet is moved. In (b), when the
conductor is moved through the field, voltage is induced. If the conductor
is moved to the right, its far end is positive; if it is moved to the left, the
polarity reverses and its far end becomes negative. Again, the voltage mag-
nitude is proportional to how fast the wire is moved. In (c), voltage is
induced in coil 2 due to the magnetic field created by the current in coil 1.
At the instant the switch is closed, the meter kicks upscale; at the instant it
is opened, the meter kicks downscale. In (d) voltage is induced in a coil by
its own current. At the instant the switch is closed, the top end of the coil
becomes positive, while at the instant it is opened, the polarity reverses and
the top end becomes negative.

Chapter 13 I Inductance and Inductors
The Discovery of Electromagnetic Induction
MOST OF OUR IDEAS CONCERNING INDUCTANCE and induced voltages are due
to Michael Faraday (recall Chapter 12) and Joseph Henry (1797–1878). Work-
ing independently (Faraday in England and Henry—shown at left—in the
USA), they discovered, almost simultaneously, the fundamental laws govern-
ing electromagnetic induction.
While experimenting with magnetic fields, Faraday developed the trans-
former. He wound two coils on an iron ring and energized one of them from a
battery. As he closed the switch energizing the first coil, Faraday noticed that a
momentary voltage was induced in the second coil, and when he opened the
switch, he found that a momentary voltage was again induced but with oppo-
site polarity. When the current was steady, no voltage was produced at all.
Faraday explained this effect in terms of his magnetic lines of flux con-
cept. When current was first turned on, he visualized the lines as springing out-
ward into space; when it was turned off, he visualized the lines as collapsing
inward. He then visualized that voltage was produced by these lines as they cut
across circuit conductors. Companion experiments showed that voltage was
also produced when a magnet was passed through a coil or when a conductor
was moved through a magnetic field. Again, he visualized these voltages in
terms of flux cutting a conductor.
Working independently in the United States, Henry discovered essentially
the same results. In fact, Henry’s work preceded Faraday’s by a few months,
but because he did not publish them first, credit was given to Faraday. How-
ever, Henry is credited with the discovery of self-induction, and in honor of his
work the unit of inductance was named the henry.
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Since we work with time-vary-
ing flux linkages in this chapter,
we use f rather than  for flux
(as we did in Chapter 12). This is
in keeping with the standard
practice of using lowercase sym-
bols for time-varying quantities
and uppercase symbols for dc
quantities.
NOTES…

Faraday’s Law
Based on these observations, Faraday concluded that voltage is induced in a
circuit whenever the flux linking (i.e., passing through) the circuit is chang-
ing and that the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the rate of
change of the flux linkages. This result, known as Faraday’s law, is also
sometimes stated in terms of the rate of cutting flux lines. We look at this
viewpoint in Chapter 15.

Principle of electromagnetic induction. Voltage is induced as long as the
flux linkage of the circuit is changing.

Lenz’s Law
Heinrich Lenz (a Russian physicist, 1804–1865) determined a companion
result. He showed that the polarity of the induced voltage is such as to
oppose the cause producing it. This result is known as Lenz’s law.
13.2
Induced Voltage and Induction
We now turn our attention to inductors. As noted earlier, inductance is due
entirely to the magnetic field created by current-carrying conductors. Con-
sider Figure 13–3 (which shows an inductor at three instants of time). In
(a) the current is constant, and since the magnetic field is due to this cur-
rent, the magnetic field is also constant. Applying Faraday’s law, we note
that, because the flux linking the coil is not changing, the induced voltage
is zero. Now consider (b). Here, the current (and hence the field) is increas-
ing. According to Faraday’s law, a voltage is induced that is proportional to
how fast the field is changing and according to Lenz’s law, the polarity of
this voltage must be such as to oppose the increase in current. Thus, the
polarity of the voltage is as shown. Note that the faster the current
increases, the larger the opposing voltage. Now consider (c). Since the cur-
rent is decreasing, Lenz’s law shows that the polarity of the induced volt-
age reverses, that is, the collapsing field produces a voltage that tries to
keep the current going. Again, the faster the rate of change of current, the
larger is this voltage.

Counter EMF
Because the induced voltage in Figure 13–3 tries to counter (i.e., opposes)
changes in current, it is called a counter emf or back voltage. Note care-
fully, however, that this voltage does not oppose current, it opposes only
changes in current. It also does not prevent the current from changing; it
only prevents it from changing abruptly. The result is that current in an
inductor changes gradually and smoothly from one value to another as indi-
cated in Figure 13–4(b). The effect of inductance is thus similar to the effect

Iron-Core and Air-Core Inductors
As Faraday discovered, the voltage induced in a coil depends on flux link-
ages, and flux linkages depend on core materials. Coils with ferromagnetic
cores (called iron-core coils) have their flux almost entirely confined to
their cores, while coils wound on nonferromagnetic materials do not. (The
latter are sometimes called air-core coils because all nonmagnetic core
materials have the same permeability as air and thus behave magnetically
the same as air.)
First, consider the iron-core case, Figure 13–5. Ideally, all flux lines
are confined to the core and hence pass through (link) all turns of the wind-
ing. The product of flux times the number of turns that it passes through is
defined as the flux linkage of the coil. For Figure 13–5, f lines pass
through N turns yielding a flux linkage of Nf. By Faraday’s law, the
induced voltage is proportional to the rate of change of Nf. In the SI sys-
tem, the constant of proportionality is one and Faraday’s law for this case
may therefore be stated as
e  N  the rate of change of f

ple, prevents abrupt changes in engine speed but does not prevent the engine
from gradually changing from one speed to another.

its polarity.

Now consider an air-core inductor (Figure 13–6). Since not all flux lines
pass through all windings, it is difficult to determine flux linkages as above.
However, (since no ferromagnetic material is present) flux is directly propor-
tional to current. In this case, then, since induced voltage is proportional to
the rate of change of flux, and since flux is proportional to current, induced
voltage will be proportional to the rate of change of current. Let the constant
of proportionality be L. Thus,

13.3
Self-Inductance
In the preceding section, we showed that the voltage induced in a coil is
e  Ldi/dt; where L is the self-inductance of the coil (usually referred to
simply as inductance) and di/dt is the rate of change of its current. In the
SI system, L is measured in henries. As can be seen from Equation 13–4,
it is the ratio of voltage induced in a coil to the rate of change of current
producing it. From this, we get the definition of the henry. By definition,
the inductance of a coil is one henry if the voltage created by its chang-
ing current is one volt when its current changes at the rate of one ampere
per second.

The accuracy of Equation 13–6 breaks down for small /d ratios. (If /d
is greater than 10, the error is less than 4%.) Improved formulas may be
found in design handbooks, such as the Radio Amateur’s Handbook pub-
lished by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).
To provide greater inductance in smaller spaces, iron cores are some-
times used. Unless the core flux is kept below saturation, however, perme-
ability varies and inductance is not constant. To get constant inductance an
air gap may be used (Figure 13–10). If the gap is wide enough to dominate,
coil inductance is approximately

where m0 is the permeability of air, Ag is the area of the air gap, and g is its

tance is to use a ferrite core (Section 13.6).

PRACTICAL NOTES...
1. Since inductance is due to a conductor’s magnetic field, it depends on the
same factors that the magnetic field depends on. The stronger the field for
a given current, the greater the inductance. Thus, a coil of many turns will
have more inductance than a coil of a few turns (L is proportional to N2)
and a coil wound on a magnetic core will have greater inductance than a
coil wound on a nonmagnetic form.
2. However, if a coil is wound on a magnetic core, the core’s permeability m
may change with flux density. Since flux density depends on current, L
becomes a function of current. For example, the inductor of Figure 13–11

has a nonlinear inductance due to core saturation. All inductors encoun-
tered in this book are assumed to be linear, i.e., of constant value.
13.4
Computing Induced Voltage
Earlier, we determined that the voltage across an inductance is given by vL 
Ldi/dt, where the voltage and current references are shown in Figure 13–8.
Note that the polarity of vL depends on whether the current is increasing or
decreasing. For example, if the current is increasing, di/dt is positive and so
vL is positive, while if the current is decreasing, di/dt is negative and vL is
negative.
To compute voltage, we need to determine di/dt. In general, this
requires calculus. However, since di/dt is slope, you can determine voltage
without calculus for currents that can be described by straight lines, as in
Figure 13–12. For any t segment, slope  i/t, where i is the amount
that the current changes during time interval t.

For inductances in series or parallel, the equivalent inductance is found by
using the same rules that you used for resistance. For the series case (Figure

Practical Considerations
Core Types
The type of core used in an inductor depends to a great extent on its
intended use and frequency range. (Although you have not studied fre-
quency yet, you can get a feel for frequency by noting that the electrical

power system operates at low frequency [60 cycles per second, called 60
hertz], while radio and TV systems operate at high frequency [hundreds of
megahertz].) Inductors used in audio or power supply applications gener-
ally have iron cores (because they need large inductance values), while
inductors for radio-frequency circuits generally use air or ferrite cores.
(Ferrite is a mixture of iron oxide in a ceramic binder. It has characteristics
that make it suitable for high-frequency work.) Iron cannot be used, how-
ever, since it has large power losses at high frequencies (for reasons dis-
cussed in Chapter 17).
Variable Inductors
Inductors can be made so that their inductance is variable. In one approach,
inductance is varied by changing coil spacing with a screwdriver adjustment.
In another approach (Figure 13–19), a threaded ferrite slug is screwed in or
out of the coil to vary its inductance.
Section 13.6 I Practical Considerations
505
FIGURE 13–19
A variable inductor with its ferrite core removed for viewing.
Circuit Symbols
Figure 13–20 shows inductor symbols. Iron-cores are identified by double
solid lines, while dashed lines denote a ferrite core. (Air-core inductors have
no core symbol.) An arrow indicates a variable inductor.
Coil Resistance
Ideally, inductors have only inductance. However, since inductors are made
of imperfect conductors (e.g., copper wire), they also have resistance. (We
can view this resistance as being in series with the coil’s inductance as
indicated in Figure 13–21(a). Also shown is stray capacitance, considered
next.) Although coil resistance is generally small, it cannot always be
ignored and thus, must sometimes be included in the analysis of a circuit.

In Section 13.7, we show how this resistance is taken into account in dc
analysis; in later chapters, you will learn how to take it into account in
ac analysis.

(b) Separating coil into sections helps
         reduce stray capacitance
FIGURE 13–21
A ferrite-core choke.
Stray Capacitance
Because the turns of an inductor are separated from each other by insulation,
a small amount of capacitance exists from winding to winding. This capaci-
tance is called stray or parasitic capacitance. Although this capacitance is
distributed from turn to turn, its effect can be approximated by lumping it as
in Figure 13–21(a). The effect of stray capacitance depends on frequency. At
low frequencies, it can usually be neglected; at high frequencies, it may have
to be taken into account. Some coils are wound in multiple sections as in
Figure 13–21(b) to reduce stray capacitance.
Stray Inductance
Because inductance is due entirely to the magnetic effects of electric current,
all current-carrying conductors have inductance. This means that leads on
circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, and so on, all
have inductance, as do traces on printed circuit boards and wires in cables.
We call this inductance “stray inductance.” Fortunately, in many cases, the
stray inductance is so small that it can be neglected.
PRACTICAL NOTES...
Although stray inductance is small, it is not always negligible. In general,
stray inductance will not be a problem for short wires at low to moderate fre-
quencies. However, even a short piece of wire can be a problem at high fre-
quencies, or a long piece of wire at low frequencies. For example, the induc-
tance of just a few centimeters of conductor in a high-speed logic system may
be nonnegligible because the current through it changes at such a high rate.

13.7
Inductance and Steady State DC
We now look at inductive circuits with constant dc current. Consider Figure
13–22. The voltage across an ideal inductance with constant dc current is
zero because the rate of change of current is zero. This is indicated in (a).
Since the inductor has current through it but no voltage across it, it looks like
a short circuit, (b). This is true in general, that is, an ideal inductor looks like
a short circuit in steady state dc. (This should not be surprising since it is
just a piece of wire to dc.) For a nonideal inductor, its dc equivalent is its coil
resistance (Figure 13–23). For steady state dc, problems can be solved using
simple dc analysis techniques.

Energy Stored by an Inductance
When power flows into an inductor, energy is stored in its magnetic field.
When the field collapses, this energy is returned to the circuit. For an ideal
inductor, R  0 ohm and hence no power is dissipated; thus, an ideal induc-
tor has zero power loss.
To determine the energy stored by an ideal inductor, consider Figure 13–
27. Power to the inductor is given by p  vLi watts, where vL  Ldi/dt. By
summing this power (see next ), the energy is found to be
W  1

Li2
(J)
(13–11)
where i is the instantaneous value of current. When current reaches its steady
state value I, W  1⁄2LI 2 J. This energy remains stored in the field as long as
the current continues. When the current goes to zero, the field collapses and
the energy is returned to the circuit.

Inductor Troubleshooting Hints
Inductors may fail by either opening or shorting. Failures may be caused by
misuse, defects in manufacturing, or faulty installation.
Open Coil
Opens can be the result of poor solder joints or broken connections. First,
make a visual inspection. If nothing wrong is found, disconnect the inductor
and check it with an ohmmeter. An open-circuited coil has infinite resis-
tance.
Shorts
Shorts can occur between windings or between the coil and its core (for an
iron-core unit). A short may result in excessive current and overheating.
Again, check visually. Look for burned insulation, discolored components,

an acrid odor, and other evidence of overheating. An ohmmeter can be used
to check for shorts between windings and the core. However, checking coil
resistance for shorted turns is often of little value, especially if only a few
turns are shorted. This is because the shorting of a few windings will not
change the overall resistance enough to be measurable. Sometimes the only
conclusive test is to substitute a known good inductor for the suspected one.

n Chapter 11, you learned that transients occur in capacitive circuits because
capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously. In this chapter, you will
learn that transients occur in inductive circuits because inductor current cannot
change instantaneously. Although the details differ, you will find that many of
the basic ideas are the same.
Inductive transients result when circuits containing inductance are dis-
turbed. More so than capacitive transients, inductive transients are potentially
destructive and dangerous. For example, when you break the current in an induc-
tive circuit, an extremely large and damaging voltage may result.
In this chapter, we study basic RL transients. We look at transients during
current buildup and decay and learn how to calculate the voltages and currents
that result.

PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Inductance, the Dual of Capacitance
INDUCTANCE IS THE DUAL of capacitance. This means that the effect that induc-
tance has on circuit operation is identical with that of capacitance if you inter-
change the term current for voltage, open circuit for short circuit, and so on. For
example, for simple dc transients, current in an RL circuit has the same form as
voltage in an RC circuit: they both rise to their final value exponentially accord-
ing to 1  et/t. Similarly, voltage across inductance decays in the same manner
as current through capacitance, i.e., according to et/t.
Duality applies to steady state and initial condition representations as well.
To steady state dc, for example, a capacitor looks like an open circuit, while an
inductor looks like a short circuit. Similarly, the dual of a capacitor that looks
like a short circuit at the instant of switching is an inductor that looks like an
open circuit. Finally, the dual of a capacitor that has an initial condition of V0
volts is an inductance with an initial condition of I0 amps.
The principle of duality is helpful in circuit analysis as it lets you transfer
the principles and concepts learned in one area directly into another. You will
find, for example, that many of the ideas learned in Chapter 11 reappear here in
their dual form.

14.1
Introduction
As you saw in Chapter 11, when a circuit containing capacitance is dis-
turbed, voltages and currents do not change to their new values immedi-
ately, but instead pass through a transitional phase as the circuit capaci-
tance charges or discharges. The voltages and currents during this
transitional interval are called transients. In a dual fashion, transients
occur when circuits containing inductances are disturbed. In this case,
however, transients occur because current in inductance cannot change
instantaneously.
To get at the idea, consider Figure 14–1. In (a), we see a purely resis-
tive circuit. At the instant the switch is closed, current jumps from 0 to E/R
as required by Ohm’s law. Thus, no transient (i.e., transitional phase)
occurs because current reaches its final value immediately. Now consider
(b). Here, we have added inductance. At the instant the switch is closed, a
counter emf appears across the inductance. This voltage attempts to stop
the current from changing and consequently slows its rise. Current thus
does not jump to E/R immediately as in (a), but instead climbs gradually
and smoothly as in (b). The larger the inductance, the longer the transition
takes.
520
Chapter 14 I Inductive Transients
FIGURE 14–1
Transient due to inductance. Adding inductance to a resistive circuit
slows the current rise and fall, thus creating a transient.
Continuity of Current
As Figure 14–1(b) illustates, current through an inductance cannot change
instantaneously, i.e., it cannot jump abruptly from one value to another, but
must be continuous at all values of time. This observation is known as the
statement of continuity of current for inductance. You will find this state-
ment of great value when analyzing circuits containing inductance. We will
use it many times in what follows.
The continuity statement for
inductor current has a sound
mathematical basis. Recall,
induced voltage is proportional
to the rate of change of current.
In calculus notation,
vL  Ld
d
i
t

This means that the faster that
current changes, the larger the
induced voltage. If inductor cur-
rent could change from one
value to another instantaneously
as in Figure 14–1(a), its rate of
change (i.e., di/dt) would be infi-
nite and hence the induced volt-
age would be infinite. But infi-
nite voltage is not possible.
Thus, inductor current cannot
change instantaneously.

Inductor Voltage
Now consider inductor voltage. When the switch is open as in Figure 14–
2(a), the current in the circuit and voltage across L are both zero. Now close
the switch. Immediately after the switch is closed, the current is still zero,
(since it cannot change instantaneously). Since vR  Ri, the voltage across R
is also zero and thus the full source voltage appears across L as shown in (b).
The inductor voltage therefore jumps from 0 V just before the switch is
closed to E volts just after. It then decays to zero, since, as we saw in Chap-
ter 13, the voltage across inductance is zero for steady state dc. This is indi-
cated in (c).

FIGURE 14–2
Voltage across L.
Open-Circuit Equivalent of an Inductance
Consider again Figure 14–2(b). Note that just after the switch is closed, the
inductor has voltage across it but no current through it. It therefore momen-
tarily looks like an open circuit. This is indicated in Figure 14–3. This obser-
vation is true in general, that is, an inductor with zero initial current looks
like an open circuit at the instant of switching. (Later, we extend this state-
ment to include inductors with nonzero initial currents.)
Initial Condition Circuits
Voltages and currents in circuits immediately after switching must some-
times be calculated. These can be determined with the aid of the open-circuit
equivalent. By replacing inductances with open circuits, you can see what a
circuit looks like just after switching. Such a circuit is called an initial con-
dition circuit.

Initial condition networks yield voltages and currents only at the instant
of switching, i.e., at t  0 s. Thus, the value of 8 V calculated in Example
14–1 is only a momentary value as illustrated in Figure 14–5. Sometimes
such an initial value is all that you need. In other cases, you need the com-
plete solution. This is considered next, in Section 14.2.

work shown in (b). Thus i  E/RT  20 V/10   2 A and the voltage across

We will now develop equations to describe voltages and current during ener-
gization. Consider Figure 14–7. KVL yields

by direct substitution as we illustrate next. Note that E/R is the final (steady

At t  0.4 s, i  5(1  e5(0.4))  5(1  e2)  4.32 A.
Continuing in this manner, you get Table 14–1.
c. Values are plotted in Figure 14–8. Note that this curve looks exactly like
the curves we determined intuitively in Figure 14–1(b).
d. Steady state current is E/R  50 V/10   5 A. This agrees with the curve
of Figure 14–8.

Circuit Voltages
With i known, circuit voltages can be determined. Consider voltage vR. Since
vR  Ri, when you multiply R times Equation 14–3, you get
vR  E(1  eRt/L)
(V)
(14–4)
Note that vR has exactly the same shape as the current. Now consider vL.
Voltage vL can be found by subtracting vR from E as per Equation 14–1:
vL  E  vR  E  E(1  eRt/L)  E  E  EeRt/L
Thus,
vL  EeRt/L
(14–5)
An examination of Equation 14–5 shows that vL has an initial value of E at
t  0 s and then decays exponentially to zero. This agrees with our earlier
observation in Figure 14–2(c).

Solution
Transients last five time constants. Thus, t  50 ms/5  10 ms.
Now t  L/R. Therefore, R  L/t  2 mH/10 ms  200 .

a. What are E and t?
b. What is R?

a. From Equation 14–8, vL  Eet/t  100e5t. Therefore, E  100 V and

Therefore, E/R  40 A and R  E/40 A  100 V/40 A  2.5 .
c. t  L/R. Therefore, L  Rt  (2.5)(0.2)  0.5 H.
It is sometimes easier to solve problems using the time constant curves
than it is to solve the equation. (Be sure to convert curve percentages to a
decimal value first, e.g., 63.2% to 0.632.) To illustrate, consider the problem
of Examples 14–2 and 14–3. From Figure 14–10 at t  t  0.2 s, i 
0.632E/R and vL  0.368E. Thus, i  0.632(5 A)  3.16 A and vL 
0.368(50 V)  18.4 V as we found earlier.
The effect of inductance and resistance on transient duration is shown in
Figure 14–11. The larger the inductance, the longer the transient for a given
resistance. Resistance has the opposite effect: for a fixed inductance, the

larger the resistance, the shorter the transient. [This is not hard to under-
stand. As R increases, the circuit looks more and more resistive. If you get to
a point where inductance is negligible compared with resistance, the circuit
looks purely resistive, as in Figure 14–1(a), and no transient occurs.]

14.3
Interrupting Current in an Inductive Circuit
We now look at what happens when inductor current is interrupted. Consider
Figure 14–13. At the instant the switch is opened, the field begins to col-
lapse, which induces a voltage in the coil. If inductance is large and current

The sudden collapse of the magnetic field when the switch is opened

is high, a great deal of energy is released in a very short time, creating a
huge voltage that may damage equipment and create a shock hazard. (This
induced voltage is referred to as an inductive kick.) For example, abruptly
breaking the current through a large inductor (such as a motor or generator
field coil) can create voltage spikes up to several thousand volts, a value
large enough to draw long arcs as indicated in Figure 14–13. Even moderate
sized inductances in electronic systems can create enough voltage to cause
damage if protective circuitry is not used.
The dynamics of the switch flashover are not hard to understand. When
the field collapses, the voltage across the coil rises rapidly. Part of this volt-
age appears across the switch. As the switch voltage rises, it quickly exceeds
the breakdown strength of air, causing a flashover between its contacts. Once
struck, the arc is easily maintained, as it creates ionized gases that provide a
relatively low resistance path for conduction. As the contacts spread apart,
the arc elongates and eventually disappears as the coil energy is dissipated
and coil voltage drops below that required to sustain the arc.
There are several important points to note here:
1. Flashovers, as in Figure 14–13, are generally undesirable. However, they
can be controlled through proper engineering design. (One way is to use a
discharge resistor, as in the next example; another way is to use a diode,
as you will see in your electronics course.)
2. On the other hand, the large voltages created by breaking inductive currents
have their uses. One is in the ignition system of automobiles, where current
in the primary winding of a transformer coil is interrupted at the appropriate
time by a control circuit to create the spark needed to fire the engine.
3. It is not possible to rigorously analyze the circuit of Figure 14–13 because
the resistance of the arc changes as the switch opens. However, the main
ideas can be established by studying circuits using fixed resistors as we
see next.
The Basic Ideas
We begin with the circuit of Figure 14–14. Assume the switch is closed and
the circuit is in steady state. Since the inductance looks like a short circuit
[Figure 14–15(a)], its current is iL  120 V/30   4 A.
528
Chapter 14 I Inductive Transients
The intuitive explanation here
has a sound mathematical basis.
Recall, back emf (induced volt-
age) across a coil is given by
vL  Ld
d
i
t
  L

where i is the change in cur-
rent and t is the time interval
over which the change takes
place. When you open the
switch, current begins to drop
immediately toward zero. Since
i is finite, and t →0, the volt-
age across L rises to a very large
value, causing a flashover to
occur. After the flashover, cur-
rent has a path through which to
decay and thus t, although
small, no longer approaches
zero. The result is a large but
finite voltage spike across L.

fore, just after opening the switch, it must still be 4 A. As indicated in (b),
this 4 A passes through resistances R1 and R2, creating voltages vR1  4 A 
30   120 V and vR2  4 A  600   2400 V with the polarity shown.
From KVL, vL  vR1  vR2  0. Therefore at the instant the switch is opened,
vL  (vR1  vR2)  2520 volts
appears across the coil, yielding a negative voltage spike as in Figure 14–16.
Note that this spike is more than 20 times larger than the source voltage. As
we see in the next section, the size of this spike depends on the ratio of R2 to
R1; the larger the ratio, the larger the voltage.
Consider again Figure 14–15. Note that current i2 changes abruptly from
0.2 A just prior to switching to 4 A just after. This is permissible, however,
since i2 does not pass through the inductor and only currents through induc-
tance cannot change abruptly.

PROBLEMS 3
Figure 14–16 shows the voltage across the coil of Figure 14–14. Make a similar
sketch for the voltage across the switch and across resistor R2. Hint: Use KVL to
find vSW and vR2.
Answer: vSW: With the switch closed, vSW  0 V; When the switch is opened, vSW jumps to
2520 V, then decays to 120 V. vR2: Identical to Figure 14–16 except that vR2 begins at
2400 V instead of 2520 V.
Inductor Equivalent at Switching
Figure 14–17 shows the current through L of Figure 14–15. Because the cur-
rent is the same immediately after switching as it is immediately before, it is
constant over the interval from t  0 s to t  0 s. Since this is true in gen-
eral, we see that an inductance with an initial current looks like a current
source at the instant of switching. Its value is the value of the current at
switching. This is shown in Figure 14–18.

De-energizing Transients
We now look at equations for the voltages and currents described in the pre-
vious section. As we go through this material, you should focus on the basic
principles involved, rather than just the resulting equations.You will probably

forget formulas, but if you understand principles, you should be able to rea-
son your way through many problems using just the basic current and volt-
age relationships.
Consider Figure 14–19(a). Let the initial current in the inductor be
denoted as I0 amps. Now open the switch as in (b). KVL yields vL  vR1 
vR2  0. Substituting vL  Ldi/dt, vR1  R1i, and vR2  R2i yields Ldi/dt  (R1 

EXAMPLE 14–6
For Figure 14–19(a), assume the current has reached
steady state with the switch closed. Suppose that E  120 V, R1  30 , R2 
600 , and L  126 mH:
a. Determine I0.
b. Determine the decay time constant.
c. Determine the equation for the current decay.
d. Compute the current i at t  0 s and t  0.5 ms.
Solution
a. Consider Figure 14–19(a). Since the circuit is in a steady state, the induc-
tor looks like a short circuit to dc. Thus, I0  E/R1  4 A.
b. Consider Figure 14–19(b). t  L/(R1  R2)  126 mH/630   0.2 ms.
c. i  I0et/t  4et/0.2 ms A.
d. At t  0 s, i  4e0  4 A.
At t  0.5 ms, i  4e0.5 ms/0.2 ms  4e2.5  0.328 A.
Now consider voltage vL. It can be shown to be
vL  V0et/t
(14–13)
where V0 is the voltage across L just after the switch is opened. Letting i  I0
in Figure 14–19(b), you can see that V0  I0(R1  R2)  I0RT. Thus
Equation 14–13 can be written as
vL  I0RTet/t
(14–14)

Finally, if the current has reached steady state before the switch is opened,
I0  E/R1, and Equation 14–14 becomes
vL  E1  R

(14–15)
Note that vL starts at V0 volts (which is negative) and decays to zero as shown
in Figure 14–20.
Now consider the resistor voltages. Each is the product of resistance
times current (Equation 14–10). Thus,
vR1  R1I0et/t
(14–16)
and
vR2  R2I0et/t
(14–17)
If current has reached steady state before switching, these become

2400et/0.2 ms V. These can also be written as vL  2520e5000t V and so on if
desired.
Decay problems can also be solved using the decay portion of the uni-
versal time constant curves shown in Figure 14–10.

The circuit is in steady state with the switch closed. Use Figure 14–10 to find
i and vL at t  2 t after the switch is opened.
Solution
I0  E/R1  3 A. At t  2 t, current will have decayed to 13.5%.
Therefore, i  0.135I0  0.405A and vL  (R1  R1)i  (60 )(0.405A) 
24.3 V. (Alternately, V0  (3 A)(60 )  180 V. At t  2 t, this has
decayed to 13.5%. Therefore, vL  0.135(180 V)  24.3 V as above.)

The equations developed so far apply only to circuits of the forms of Figures

A Note About Time Scales
Until now, we have considered energization and de-energization phases sep-
arately. When both occur in the same problem, we must clearly define what
we mean by time. One way to handle this problem (as we did with RC cir-
cuits) is to define t  0 s as the beginning of the first phase and solve for
voltages and currents in the usual manner, then shift the time axis to the
beginning of the second phase, redefine t  0 s and then solve the second
part. This is illustrated in Example 14–10. Note that only the first time scale
is shown explicitly on the graph.

Now consider voltage. As indicated in Figure 14–26(b), the voltage

vL  V0et/t  280e28t

c. You can use the universal time constant curves at t  100 ms since 100 ms

0.135(200 V)  27.0 V. Now consider t  350 ms: Note that this is 50 ms
into the decay portion of the curve. However, since 50 ms is not a multiple
of t, it is difficult to use the curves. Therefore, use the equations. Thus,

Workbench can easily plot voltage, but it has no simple way to plot current.
If you want to determine current, use Ohm’s law and the applicable voltage
waveform. To illustrate, consider Figure 14–21(a). Since the inductor current
passes through R4, we can use the voltage across R4 to monitor current. Sup-
pose we want to know at what time iL reaches 0.12 A. (This corresponds to
0.12 A  104   12.48 V across R4.) Create the circuit as in Figure 14–30.

a. When you close the switch, you short out E and R1, leaving the decay cir-

b. In steady state with the switch open, iL  I0  100 V/50   2 A. This is
the current just before the switch is closed. Therefore, just after the switch

sponding value of time should be 22.9 ms as determined previously.
OrCAD PSpice
RL transients are handled much like RC transients.As a first example, consider
Figure 14–33. The circuit is in steady state with the switch closed.At t  0, the
switch is opened. Use PSpice to plot inductor voltage and current, then use the
cursor to determine values at t  100 ms. Verify manually. (Since the process
is similar to that of Chapter 11, abbreviated instructions only are given.)
Section 14.6 I RL Transients Using Computers
539
Preliminary:
First, determine the initial current in the inductor, i.e., the
current I0 that exists at the instant the switch is opened. This is done by not-
ing that the inductor looks like a short circuit to steady state dc. Thus, I0 
12 V/ 4  3 A. Next, note that after the switch is opened, current builds up
through R1, R2, and R3 in series. Thus, the time constant of the circuit is t 
L1/RT  3 H/30   0.1 s. Now proceed as follows:
• Build the circuit on the screen. Double click the inductor symbol and
using the procedure from Chapter 11, set its initial condition IC to 3A.
Click the New Profile icon and name the file fig14-33. In the Simulations
Settings box, select transient analysis and set TSTOP to 0.5 (five time con-
stants). Click OK.
• Click the Run icon. When simulation is complete, a trace of capacitor volt-
age versus time appears. Create a second Y Axis, then add the current
trace I(L1). You should now have the curves of Figure 14–34 on the
screen. (The Y-axes can be labeled if desired as described in Appendix A.)
Results:
Consider Figure 14–33. With the switch open, steady state current
is 180 V/30   6 A and the initial current is 3 A. Thus, the current should
start at 3 A and rise to 6 A in 5 time constants. (It does.) Inductor voltage

should start at 180 V  (3 A)(30 )  90 V and decay to 0 V in 5 time con-
stants. (It does). Thus, the solution checks. Now, with the cursor, scale volt-
age and current values at t  100 ms. You should get 33.1 V for vL and 4.9 A
for iL. (To check, note that the equations for inductor voltage and current are
vL  90 e10 t V and iL  6  3 e10 t A respectively. Substitute t  100 ms
into these and verify results.)

analysis then type in a value of 0.5 for TSTOP. Run the simulation, create a
second Y-axis, then add the current trace I(L1). You should now have the
curves of Figure 14–36 on the screen. (Compare to Figure 14–27.) Using the
cursor, read values at t  100 ms and 350 ms. You should get approximately
27 V and 1.73 mA at t  100 ms and 69 V and 490 mA at t  350 ms. Note
how well these agree with the results of Example 14–10.

T
he first sample of a new product that your company has designed has an
indicator light that fails. (Symptom: When you turn a new unit on, the
indicator light comes on as it should. However, when you turn the power off
and back on, the lamp does not come on again.) You have been asked to
investigate the problem and design a fix. You acquire a copy of the schematic
and study the portion of the circuit where the indicator lamp is located. As
shown in the accompanying figure, the lamp is used to indicate the status of
the coil; the light is to be on when the coil is energized and off when it is not.
Immediately, you see the problem, solder in one component and the problem
is fixed. Write a short note to your supervisor outlining the nature of the prob-
lem, explaining why the lamp burned out and why your design modification
fixed the problem. Note also that your modification did not result in any sub-
stantial increase in power consumption (i.e., you did not use a resistor). Note:
This problem requires a diode. If you have not had an introduction to elec-
tronics, you will need to obtain a basic electronics book and read about it.

A
lternating currents (ac) are currents that alternate in direction (usually
many times per second), passing first in one direction, then in the other
through a circuit. Such currents are produced by voltage sources whose polari-
ties alternate between positive and negative (rather than being fixed as with dc
sources). By convention, alternating currents are called ac currents and alternat-
ing voltages are called ac voltages.
The variation of an ac voltage or current versus time is called its waveform.
Since waveforms vary with time, they are designated by lowercase letters v(t),
i(t), e(t), and so on, rather than by uppercase letters V, I, and E as for dc. Often
we drop the functional notation and simply use v, i, and e.
While many waveforms are important to us, the most fundamental is the
sine wave (also called sinusoidal ac). In fact, the sine wave is of such importance
that many people associate the term ac with sinusoidal, even though ac refers to
any quantity that alternates with time.
In this chapter, we look at basic ac principles, including the generation of ac
voltages and ways to represent and manipulate ac quantities. These ideas are
then used throughout the remainder of the book to develop methods of analysis
for ac circuits.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Thomas Alva Edison
NOWADAYS WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED that our electrical power systems are ac.
(This is driven home every time you see a piece of equipment rated “60 hertz
ac”, for example.) However, this was not always the case. In the late 1800s, a
fierce battle—the so-called “war of the currents”—raged in the emerging electri-
cal power industry. The forces favoring the use of dc were led by Thomas Alva
Edison, and those favoring the use of ac were led by George Westinghouse
(Chapter 24) and Nikola Tesla (Chapter 23).
Edison, a prolific inventor who gave us the electric light, the phonograph,
and many other great inventions as well, fought vigorously for dc. He had spent
a considerable amount of time and money on the development of dc power and
had a lot at stake, in terms of both money and prestige. So unscrupulous was
Edison in this battle that he first persuaded the state of New York to adopt ac for
its newly devised electric chair, and then pointed at it with horror as an example
of how deadly ac was. Ultimately, however, the combination of ac’s advantages
over dc and the stout opposition of Tesla and Westinghouse won the day for ac.
Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio. Most of his work was done at two
sites in New Jersey—first at a laboratory in Menlo Park, and later at a much
larger laboratory in West Orange, where his staff at one time numbered around
5,000. He received patents as inventor or co-inventor on an astonishing 1,093
inventions, making him probably the greatest inventor of all time.
Thomas Edison died at the age of 84 on October 18, 1831.

15.1
Introduction
Previously you learned that dc sources have fixed polarities and constant
magnitudes and thus produce currents with constant value and unchanging
direction, as illustrated in Figure 15–1. In contrast, the voltages of ac sources
alternate in polarity and vary in magnitude and thus produce currents that
vary in magnitude and alternate in direction.

Sinusoidal AC Voltage
To illustrate, consider the voltage at the wall outlet in your home. Called a
sine wave or sinusoidal ac waveform (for reasons discussed in Section
15.5), this voltage has the shape shown in Figure 15–2. Starting at zero, the
voltage increases to a positive maximum, decreases to zero, changes polarity,
increases to a negative maximum, then returns again to zero. One complete
variation is referred to as a cycle. Since the waveform repeats itself at regular
intervals as in (b), it is called a periodic waveform.

Symbol for an AC Voltage Source
The symbol for a sinusoidal voltage source is shown in Figure 15–3. Note
that a lowercase e is used to represent voltage rather than E, since it is a
function of time. Polarity marks are also shown although, since the polarity
of the source varies, their meaning has yet to be established.

Sinusoidal AC Current
Figure 15–4 shows a resistor connected to an ac source. During the first half-
cycle, the source voltage is positive; therefore, the current is in the clockwise
direction. During the second half-cycle, the voltage polarity reverses; there-
fore, the current is in the counterclockwise direction. Since current is propor-
tional to voltage, its shape is also sinusoidal (Figure 15–5).

15.2
Generating AC Voltages
One way to generate an ac voltage is to rotate a coil of wire at constant
angular velocity in a fixed magnetic field, Figure 15–6. (Slip rings and
brushes connect the coil to the load.) The magnitude of the resulting voltage
is proportional to the rate at which flux lines are cut (Faraday’s law, Chapter
13), and its polarity is dependent on the direction the coil sides move
through the field. Since the rate of cutting flux varies with time, the resulting
voltage will also vary with time. For example in (a), since the coil sides are
moving parallel to the field, no flux lines are being cut and the induced volt-
age at this instant (and hence the current) is zero. (This is defined as the 0°
position of the coil.) As the coil rotates from the 0° position, coil sides AA
and BB cut across flux lines; hence, voltage builds, reaching a peak when
flux is cut at the maximum rate in the 90° position as in (b). Note the polar-
ity of the voltage and the direction of current. As the coil rotates further,
voltage decreases, reaching zero at the 180° position when the coil sides
again move parallel to the field as in (c). At this point, the coil has gone
through a half-revolution.
During the second half-revolution, coil sides cut flux in directions
opposite to that which they did in the first half revolution; hence, the
polarity of the induced voltage reverses. As indicated in (d), voltage
reaches a peak at the 270° point, and, since the polarity of the voltage has
changed, so has the direction of current. When the coil reaches the 360°
position, voltage is again zero and the cycle starts over. Figure 15–7
shows one cycle of the resulting waveform. Since the coil rotates continu-
ously, the voltage produced will be a repetitive, periodic waveform as you
saw in Figure 15–2(b).

PRACTICAL NOTES...
In practice, the coil of Figure 15–6 consists of many turns wound on an iron
core. The coil, core, and slip rings rotate as a unit.
In Figure 15–6, the magnetic field is fixed and the coil rotates. While
small generators are built this way, large ac generators usually have the oppo-

Time Scales
The horizontal axis of Figure 15–7 is scaled in degrees. Often we need it
scaled in time. The length of time required to generate one cycle depends on
the velocity of rotation. To illustrate, assume that the coil rotates at 600 rpm
(revolutions per minute). Six hundred revolutions in one minute equals 600
rev/60 s  10 revolutions in one second. At ten revolutions per second, the
time for one revolution is one tenth of a second, i.e., 100 ms. Since one cycle
is 100 ms, a half-cycle is 50 ms, a quarter-cycle is 25 ms, and so on. Figure
15–8 shows the waveform rescaled in time.
Instantaneous Value
As Figure 15–8 shows, the coil voltage changes from instant to instant. The
value of voltage at any point on the waveform is referred to as its instanta-
neous value. This is illustrated in Figure 15–9. Figure 15–9(a) shows a pho-
tograph of an actual waveform, and (b) shows it redrawn, with values scaled
from the photo. For this example, the voltage has a peak value of 40 volts
and a cycle time of 6 ms. From the graph, we see that at t  0 ms, the volt-
age is zero. At t  0.5 ms, it is 20 V. At t  2 ms, it is 35 V. At t  3.5 ms, it
is 20 V, and so on.

instead. In addition, large ac generators are usually made as three-phase
machines with three sets of coils instead of one. This is covered in Chapter
23. However, although its details are oversimplified, the generator of Figure
15–6 gives a true picture of the voltage produced by a real ac generator.

Electronic Signal Generators
AC waveforms may also be created electronically using signal generators. In
fact, with signal generators, you are not limited to sinusoidal ac. The gen-
eral-purpose lab signal generator of Figure 15–10, for example, can produce
a variety of variable-frequency waveforms, including sinusoidal, square
wave, triangular, and so on. Waveforms such as these are commonly used to
test electronic gear.

Voltage and Current Conventions for AC
In Section 15.1, we looked briefly at voltage polarities and current directions.
At that time, we used separate diagrams for each half-cycle (Figure 15–4).
However, this is unnecessary; one diagram and one set of references is all that is
required. This is illustrated in Figure 15–11. First, we assign reference polari-
ties for the source and a reference direction for the current.We then use the con-
vention that, when e has a positive value, its actual polarity is the same as the
reference polarity, and when e has a negative value, its actual polarity is oppo-
site to that of the reference. For current, we use the convention that when i has a
positive value, its actual direction is the same as the reference arrow, and when i
hasanegativevalue, its actualdirection is opposite to thatofthe reference.

(b) During the first half-cycle,

Therefore, e and i are positive.
During the second half-cycle,

e and i are negative.

AC voltage and current reference conventions.
To illustrate, consider Figure 15–12. At time t1, e has a value of 10 volts.
This means that at this instant, the voltage of the source is 10 V and its top
end is positive with respect to its bottom end. This is indicated in (b). With a
voltage of 10 V and a resistance of 5 , the instantaneous value of current is
i  e/R  10 V/5   2 A. Since i is positive, the current is in the direction
of the reference arrow.

Now consider time t2. Here, e  10 V. This means that source voltage
is again 10 V, but now its top end is negative with respect to its bottom end.
Again applying Ohm’s law, you get i  e/R  10 V/5   2 A. Since i
is negative, current is actually opposite in direction to the reference arrow.
This is indicated in (c).
The above concept is valid for any ac signal, regardless of waveshape.

Frequency, Period, Amplitude, and Peak Value
Periodic waveforms (i.e., waveforms that repeat at regular intervals), regard-
less of their waveshape, may be described by a group of attributes such as
frequency, period, amplitude, peak value, and so on.
Frequency
The number of cycles per second of a waveform is defined as its frequency.
In Figure 15–14(a), one cycle occurs in one second; thus its frequency is one
cycle per second. Similarly, the frequency of (b) is two cycles per second
and that of (c) is 60 cycles per second. Frequency is denoted by the lower-
case letter f. In the SI system, its unit is the hertz (Hz, named in honor of
pioneer researcher Heinrich Hertz, 1857–1894). By definition,
1 Hz  1 cycle per second
(15–1)
Thus, the examples depicted in Figure 15–14 represent 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 60
Hz respectively.

Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz).
The range of frequencies is immense. Power line frequencies, for example,
are 60 Hz in NorthAmerica and 50 Hz in many other parts of the world.Audible
sound frequencies range from about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz. The standard AM
radio band occupies from 550 kHz to 1.6 MHz, while the FM band extends from
88 MHz to 108 MHz. TV transmissions occupy several bands in the 54-MHz
to 890-MHz range. Above 300 GHz are optical and X-ray frequencies.
Period
The period, T, of a waveform, (Figure 15–15) is the duration of one cycle. It
is the inverse of frequency. To illustrate, consider again Figure 15–14. In (a),
the frequency is 1 cycle per second; thus, the duration of each cycle is T  1 s.

In (b), the frequency is two cycles per second; thus, the duration of each
cycle is T  1⁄2 s, and so on. In general,

Amplitude and Peak-to-Peak Value
The amplitude of a sine wave is the distance from its average to its peak.
Thus, the amplitude of the voltage in Figures 15–19(a) and (b) is Em.
Peak-to-peak voltage is also indicated in Figure 15–19(a). It is mea-
sured between minimum and maximum peaks. Peak-to-peak voltages are
denoted Ep-p or Vp-p in this book. (Some authors use Vpk-pk or the like.) Simi-
larly, peak-to-peak currents are denoted as Ip-p. To illustrate, consider again
Figure 15–9. The amplitude of this voltage is Em  40 V, and its peak-to-
peak voltage is Ep-p  80 V.
Peak Value
The peak value of a voltage or current is its maximum value with respect to
zero. Consider Figure 15–19(b). Here, a sine wave rides on top of a dc value,
yielding a peak that is the sum of the dc voltage and the ac waveform ampli-
tude. For the case indicated, the peak voltage is E  Em.

view as Figure 15–23. The voltage produced by this generator is
e  Emsin a

(15–4)
where Em is the maximum coil voltage and a is the instantaneous angular
position of the coil. (For a given generator and rotational velocity, Em is con-
stant.) Note that a  0° represents the horizontal position of the coil and that
one complete cycle corresponds to 360°. Equation 15–4 states that the volt-
age at any point on the sine wave may be found by multiplying Em times the
sine of the angle at that point.

Table 15–2 is a tabulation of voltage versus angle computed from e  100 sin a.
Use your calculator to verify each value, then plot the result on graph paper. The
resulting waveshape should look like Figure 15–24.

Angular Velocity, 
The rate at which the generator coil rotates is called its angular velocity. If the
coil rotates through an angle of 30° in one second, for example, its angular
velocity is 30° per second. Angular velocity is denoted by the Greek letter q
(omega). For the case cited, q  30°/s. (Normally angular velocity is expressed
in radians per second instead of degrees per second. We will make this change
shortly.) When you know the angular velocity of a coil and the length of time
that it has rotated, you can compute the angle through which it has turned. For
example, a coil rotating at 30°/s rotates through an angle of 30° in one second,
60° in two seconds, 90° in three seconds, and so on. In general,

Radian Measure
In practice, q is usually expressed in radians per second, where radians and
degrees are related by the identity
2p radians  360°
(15–8)
One radian therefore equals 360°/2p  57.296°. A full circle, as shown in
Figure 15–26(a), can be designated as either 360° or 2p radians. Likewise,
the cycle length of a sinusoid, shown in Figure 15–26(b), can be stated as
either 360° or 2p radians; a half-cycle as 180° or p radians, and so on.
To convert from degrees to radians, multiply by p/180, while to convert
from radians to degrees, multiply by 180/p.

Graphing Sine Waves
A sinusoidal waveform can be graphed with its horizontal axis scaled in
degrees, radians, or time. When scaled in degrees or radians, one cycle is
always 360° or 2p radians (Figure 15–27); when scaled in time, it is fre-
quency dependent, since the length of a cycle depends on the coil’s velocity
of rotation. However, if scaled in terms of period T instead of in seconds, the
waveform is also frequency independent, since one cycle is always T, as
shown in Figure 15–27(c).
When graphing a sine wave, you don’t actually need many points to get
a good sketch: Values every 45° (one eighth of a cycle) are generally ade-
quate. Table 15–4 shows corresponding values for sin a at this spacing.

EXAMPLE 15–8
Sketch the waveform for a 25-kHz sinusoidal current that
has an amplitude of 4 mA. Scale the axis in seconds.
Solution
The easiest approach is to use T  1/f, then scale the graph
accordingly. For this waveform, T  1/25 kHz  40 ms. Thus,
1. Mark the end of the cycle as 40 ms, the half-cycle point as 20 ms, the quarter-
cycle point as 10 ms, and so on (Figure 15–28).
2. The peak value (i.e., 4 mA) occurs at the quarter-cycle point, which is 10 ms
on the waveform. Likewise, 4 mA occurs at 30 ms. Now sketch.
3. Values at other time points can be determined easily. For example, the
value at 5 ms can be calculated by noting that 5 ms is one eighth of a cycle,
or 45°. Thus, i  4 sin 45° mA  2.83 mA. Alternately, from Table 15–4,

4. Values at particular angles can also be located easily. For instance, if you
want a value at 30°, the required value is i  4 sin 30° mA  2.0 mA.
To locate this point, note that 30° is one twelfth of a cycle or T/12 

cated in Figure 15–30. Now consider t2. Note that t2 is the same distance back
from the half-cycle point as t1 is in from the beginning of the cycle. Thus,
t2  60 ms  10 ms  50 ms.
b. Similarly, t3 (the first point at which i  5 A occurs) is 10 ms past mid-
point, while t4 is 10 ms back from the end of the cycle. Thus, t3  70 ms
and t4  110 ms.

Voltages and Currents with Phase Shifts
If a sine wave does not pass through zero at t  0 s as in Figure 15–30, it has
a phase shift. Waveforms may be shifted to the left or to the right (see Fig-
ure 15–31). For a waveform shifted left as in (a),

Demonstrate that v  20 sin(qt  60°), where q 
p/6 rad/s (i.e,  30°/s), yields the shifted waveform shown in Figure 15–
32.
Solution
1. Since qt and 60° are both angles, (qt  60°) is also an angle. Let us define
it as x. Then v  20 sin x, which means that the shifted wave is also sinu-
soidal.
2. Consider v  sin(qt  60°). At t  0 s, v  20 sin(0  60°)  20 sin

When applying equations 15–

express qt in radians and v in
degrees, yielding mixed angular
units (as indicated in the follow-
ing examples). Although this is
acceptable when the equations
are written in symbolic form,
you must convert both angles to
the same unit before you make
numerical computations.

Introduction to Phasors
A phasor is a rotating line whose projection on a vertical axis can be used to
represent sinusoidally varying quantities. To get at the idea, consider the red

As the phasor rotates about the origin, its vertical projection creates a
sine wave. (Figure 15–35 illustrates the process.)

projection of this line (indicated in dotted red) is Vm sin a. Now, assume that
the phasor rotates at angular velocity of q rad/s in the counterclockwise direc-
tion. Then, a  qt, and its vertical projection is Vmsin qt. If we designate
this projection (height) as v, we get v  Vmsin qt, which is the familiar sinu-
soidal voltage equation.
If you plot a graph of v versus a, you get the sine wave of Figure 15–
34(b). Figure 15–35 illustrates the process. It shows snapshots of the phasor
and the evolving waveform at various instants of time for a phasor of magni-
tude Vm  100 V rotating at q  30°/s. For example, consider t  0, 1, 2,
and 3s:
1. At t  0 s, a  0, the phasor is at its 0° position, and its vertical projec-
tion is v  Vmsin qt  100 sin 0°  0 V. The point is at the origin.
2. At t  1 s, the phasor has rotated 30° and its vertical projection is v 
100 sin 30°  50 V. This point is plotted at a  30° on the horizontal
axis.

Evolution of the sine

1. Although we have indicated

this is too cumbersome; in
practice, weshowonly the

position and imply rotation
rather than showit explicitly.
2. Although we are using maxi-
mum values (Em and Im) here,
phasors are normally drawn
in terms of effective values
(considered in Section 15.9).
For the moment, we will con-
tinue to use maximum values.

60° on the horizontal axis. Similarly, at t  3 s, a  90°, and v  100 V.
Continuing in this manner, the complete waveform is evolved.
From the foregoing, we conclude that a sinusoidal waveform can be cre-
ated by plotting the vertical projection of a phasor that rotates in the coun-
terclockwise direction at constant angular velocity q. If the phasor has a
length of Vm, the waveform represents voltage; if the phasor has a length of
Im, it represents current. Note carefully: Phasors apply only to sinusoidal
waveforms.

form.
Solution
The phasor has length 20 V and at time t  0 is at 60° as indi-
cated in (a). Now, as the phasor rotates, it generates a sinusoidal waveform,
oscillating between 20 V as indicated in (b). Note that the zero crossover
point occurs at t  2 s, since it takes 2 seconds for the phasor to rotate from
60° to 0° at 30 degrees per second. Now compare the waveform of (b) to
the waveform of Figure 15–32, Example 15–13. They are identical. Thus, the
phasor of (a) represents the shifted waveform v  20 sin(qt  60°).

The terms lead and lag can be understood in terms of phasors. If you
observe phasors rotating as in Figure 15–41(a), the one that you see passing
first is leading and the other is lagging. By definition, the waveform gener-
ated by the leading phasor leads the waveform generated by the lagging
phasor and vice versa. In Figure 15–41, phasor Im leads phasor Vm; thus cur-
rent i(t) leads voltage v(t).
Phase Difference
Phase difference refers to the angular displacement between different wave-
forms of the same frequency. Consider Figure 15–40. If the angular displace-
ment is 0° as in (a), the waveforms are said to be in phase; otherwise, they
are out of phase. When describing a phase difference, select one waveform
as reference. Other waveforms then lead, lag, or are in phase with this refer-
ence. For example, in (b), for reasons to be discussed in the next paragraph,
the current waveform is said to lead the voltage waveform, while in (c) the
current waveform is said to lag.

leads it by 30°, namely cos(qt  30°). For (b), the red phasor generates sin
qt, and the green phasor generates a waveform that leads it by 120°, i.e.,
sin(qt  120°). Since the green phasor is the same in both cases, you can see
that cos(qt  30°)  sin(qt  120°). Note that this process is easier than
trying to remember equations 15–17(a) and (b).
Sometimes you encounter negative waveforms such as i  Im sin qt.
To see how to handle these, refer back to Figure 15–36, which shows the
waveform and phasor for i  Im sin qt. If you multiply this waveform by 1,
you get the inverted waveform Im sin qt of Figure 15–47(a) with corre-
sponding phasor (b). Note that the phasor is the same as the original phasor
except that it is rotated by 180°. This is always true—thus, if you multiply a
waveform by 1, the phasor for the new waveform is 180° rotated from the
original phasor, regardless of the angle of the original phasor.

AC Waveforms and Average Value
While we can describe ac quantities in terms of frequency, period, instanta-
neous value, etc., we do not yet have any way to give a meaningful value to
an ac current or voltage in the same sense that we can say of a car battery
that it has a voltage of 12 volts. This is because ac quantities constantly
change and thus there is no one single numerical value that truly represents a
waveform over its complete cycle. For this reason, ac quantities are generally
described by a group of characteristics, including instantaneous, peak, aver-
age, and effective values. The first two of these we have already seen. In this
section, we look at average values; in Section 15.9, we consider effective
values.
Average Values
Many quantities are measured by their average, for instance, test and exami-
nation scores. To find the average of a set of marks for example, you add
them, then divide by the number of items summed. For waveforms, the
process is conceptually the same. For example, to find the average of a
waveform, you can sum the instantaneous values over a full cycle, then

divide by the number of points used. The trouble with this approach is that
waveforms do not consist of discrete values.
Average in Terms of the Area Under a Curve
An approach more suitable for use with waveforms is to find the area under
the curve, then divide by the baseline of the curve. To get at the idea, we can
use an analogy. Consider again the technique of computing the average for a
set of numbers. Assume that you earn marks of 80, 60, 60, 95, and 75 on a
group of tests. Your average mark is therefore
average  (80  60  60  95  75)/5  74
An alternate way to view these marks is graphically as in Figure 15–50.
The area under this curve can be computed as
area  (80  1)  (60  2)  (95  1)  (75  1)
Now divide this by the length of the base, namely 5. Thus,
 74

This result is true in general. Thus, to find the average value of a waveform,
divide the area under the waveform by the length of its base. Areas above the
axis are counted as positive, while areas below the axis are counted as nega-
tive. This approach is valid regardless of waveshape.
Average values are also called dc values, because dc meters indicate
average values rather than instantaneous values. Thus, if you measure a non-
dc quantity with a dc meter, the meter will read the average of the waveform,
i.e., the value calculated according to Equation 15–18.

Sine Wave Averages
Because a sine wave is symmetrical, its area below the horizontal axis is
the same as its area above the axis; thus, over a full cycle its net area is
zero, independent of frequency and phase angle. Thus, the average of sin
qt, sin(qt  v), sin 2qt, cos qt, cos(qt  v), cos 2qt, and so on are each
zero. The average of half a sine wave, however, is not zero. Consider Fig-
ure 15–54. The area under the half-cycle may be found using calculus as
area 

Similarly, the area under a half-cycle of voltage is 2Vm. (If you haven’t stud-
ied calculus, you can approximate this area using numerical methods as
described later in this section.)
Two cases are important; full-wave average and half-wave average. The
full-wave case is illustrated in Figure 15–55. The area from 0 to 2p is 2(2Im)
and the base is 2p. Thus, the average is

Numerical Methods
If the area under a curve cannot be computed exactly, it can be approxi-
mated. One method is to approximate the curve by straight line segments as
in Figure 15–57. (If the straight lines closely fit the curve, the accuracy is
very good.) Each element of area is a trapezoid (b) whose area is its average

height times its base. Thus, A1  1⁄2(y0  y1)x, A2  1⁄2(y1  y2)x, etc.

Superimposed AC and DC
Sometimes ac and dc are used in the same circuit. For example, amplifiers
are powered by dc but the signals they amplify are ac. Figure 15–59 shows a
simple circuit with combined ac and dc.
Figure 15–60(c) shows superimposed ac and dc. Since we know that the
average of a sine wave is zero, the average value of the combined waveform
will be its dc component, E. However, peak voltages depend on both compo-
nents as illustrated in (c). Note for the case illustrated that although the
waveform varies sinusoidally, it does not alternate in polarity since it never
changes polarity to become negative.

Solution
The waveform consists of a 10-V dc value with 15 V ac riding on
top of it. The average is the dc value, Vavg  10 V. The peak voltage is 10 
15  25 V, while the minimum voltage is 10  15  5 V. This waveform
alternates in polarity, although not symmetrically (as is the case when there is
no dc component).

15.9
Effective Values
While instantaneous, peak, and average values provide useful information
about a waveform, none of them truly represents the ability of the waveform
to do useful work. In this section, we look at a representation that does. It is
called the waveform’s effective value. The concept of effective value is an
important one; in practice, most ac voltages and currents are expressed as
effective values. Effective values are also called rms values for reasons dis-
cussed shortly.
What Is an Effective Value?
An effective value is an equivalent dc value: it tells you how many volts or
amps of dc that a time-varying waveform is equal to in terms of its ability to
produce average power. Effective values depend on the waveform. A famil-
iar example of such a value is the value of the voltage at the wall outlet in
your home. In North America its value is 120 Vac. This means that the sinu-
soidal voltage at the wall outlets of your home is capable of producing the
same average power as 120 volts of steady dc.
Effective Values for Sine Waves
The effective value of a waveform can be determined using the circuits of
Figure 15–62. Consider a sinusoidally varying current, i(t). By definition, the
effective value of i is that value of dc current that produces the same average
power. Consider (b). Let the dc source be adjusted until its average power is
the same as the average power in (a). The resulting dc current is then the
effective value of the current of (a). To determine this value, determine the
average power for both cases, then equate them.

Chapter 15 I AC Fundamentals
Because ac currents alternate in
direction, you might expect aver-
age power to be zero, with power
during the negative half-cycle
being equal and opposite to
power during the positive half-
cycle and hence cancelling. How-
ever, as Equation 15–22 shows,
current is squared, and hence
power is never negative. This is
consistent with the idea that inso-
far as power dissipation is con-
cerned, the direction of current
through a resistor does not matter
(Figure15–63).

Since power
depends only on current magnitude,
it is the same for both directions.

It is important to note that these relationships hold only for sinusoidal wave-
forms. However, the concept of effective value applies to all waveforms, as
we soon see.
Consider again the ac voltage at the wall outlet in your home. Since Eeff 
120 V, Em  (2	)(120 V)  170 V. This means that a sinusoidal voltage
alternating between 170 V produces the same average power as 120 V of
steady dc (Figure 15–64).
General Equation for Effective Values
The 2	 relationship holds only for sinusoidal waveforms. For other wave-
forms, you need a more general formula. Using calculus, it can be shown
that for any waveform

with a similar equation for voltage. This equation can be used to compute
effective values for any waveform, including sinusoidal. In addition, it leads
to a graphic approach to finding effective values. In Equation 15–29, the
integral of i2 represents the area under the i2 waveform. Thus,
Ieff 
(15–30)
To compute effective values using this equation, do the following:
Step 1: Square the current (or voltage) curve.
Step 2: Find the area under the squared curve.


base

Step 3: Divide the area by the length of the curve.
Step 4: Find the square root of the value from Step 3.
This process is easily carried out for rectangular-shaped waveforms since the
area under their squared curves is easy to compute. For other waveforms,
you have to use calculus or approximate the area using numerical methods.
For the special case of superimposed ac and dc (Figure 15–60), Equation
15–29 leads to the following formula:
Ieff  Id	c
2	 
	 I	ac	2	
(15–31)
where Idc is the dc current value, Iac is the effective value of the ac compo-
nent, and Ieff is the effective value of the combined ac and dc currents. Equa-
tions 15–30 and 15–31 also hold for voltage when V is substituted for I.
RMS Values
Consider again Equation 15–30. To use this equation, we compute the root
of the mean square to obtain the effective value. For this reason, effective
values are called root mean square or rms values and the terms effective
and rms are synonymous. Since, in practice, ac quantities are almost
always expressed as rms values, we shall assume from here on that, unless
otherwise noted, all ac voltages and currents are rms values.

15.10 Rate of Change of a Sine Wave (Derivative)
Several important circuit effects depend on the rate of change of sinusoidal
quantities. The rate of change of a quantity is the slope (i.e., derivative) of
its waveform versus time. Consider the waveform of Figure 15–67. As indi-
cated, the slope is maximum positive at the beginning of the cycle, zero at
both its peaks, maximum negative at the half-cycle crossover point, and
maximum positive at the end of the cycle. This slope is plotted in Figure
15–68. Note that the original waveform and its slope are 90° out of phase.
Thus, if sinusoidal waveform A is taken as reference, its slope B leads it by
90°, whereas, if the slope B is taken as reference, A lags it by 90°. Thus, if
A is a sine wave, B is a cosine wave, and so on. (This result is important to
us in Chapter 16.)

15.11 AC Voltage and Current Measurement
Two of the most important instruments for measuring ac quantities are the
multimeter and the oscilloscope. Multimeters read voltage, current, and
sometimes frequency. Oscilloscopes show waveshape and period and permit
determination of frequency, phase difference, and so on.
Meters for Voltage and Current Measurement
There are two basic classes of ac meters: one measures rms correctly for
sinusoidal waveforms only (called “average responding” instruments); the
other measures rms correctly regardless of waveform (called “true rms”
meters). Most common meters are average responding meters.
Average Responding Meters
Average responding meters use a rectifier circuit to convert incoming ac to
dc. They then respond to the average value of the rectified input, which, as
shown in Figure 15–55, is 0.637Vm for a “full-wave” rectified sine wave.
However, the rms value of a sine wave is 0.707Vm. Thus, the scale of such a
meter is modified by the factor 0.707Vm/0.637Vm  1.11 so that it indicates
rms values directly. Other meters use a “half-wave” circuit, which yields the
waveform of Figure 15–56 for a sine wave input. In this case, its average is
0.318Vm, yielding a scale factor of 0.707Vm/0.318Vm  2.22. Figure 15–69
shows a typical average responding DMM.

Section 15.11 I AC Voltage and Current Measurement
591
FIGURE 15–69
A DMM. While all DMMs measure voltage, current, and resistance,
this one also measures frequency.
True RMS Measurement
To measure the rms value of a nonsinusoidal waveform, you need a true rms
meter. A true rms meter indicates true rms voltages and currents regardless
of waveform. For example, for the waveform of Figure 15–64(a), any ac
meter will correctly read 120 V (since it is a sine wave). For the waveform of
15–61(b), a true rms meter will correctly read 14.6 V (the rms value that we
calculated earlier, in Example 15–30) but an average responding meter will
yield only a meaningless value. True rms instruments are more expensive
than standard meters.
Oscilloscopes
Oscilloscopes (frequently referred to as scopes, Figure 15–70) are used for
time domain measurement, i.e., waveshape, frequency, period, phase differ-
ence, and so on. Usually, you scale values from the screen, although some
higher-priced models can compute and display them for you on a digital
readout.
Oscilloscopes measure voltage. To measure current, you need a current-
to-voltage converter. One type of converter is a clip-on device, known as a
current gun that clamps over the current-carrying conductor and monitors
its magnetic field. (It works only with ac.) The varying magnetic field
induces a voltage which is then displayed on the screen. With such a device,
you can monitor current waveshapes and make current-related measure-
ments. Alternately, you can place a small resistor in the current path, mea-

An oscilloscope may be used for waveform analysis.
sure voltage across it with the oscilloscope, then use Ohm’s law to determine
the current.
A Final Note
AC meters measure voltage and current only over a limited frequency range,
typically from 50 Hz to a few kHz, although others are available that work
up to the 100-kHz range. Note, however, that accuracy may be affected by
frequency. (Check the manual.) Oscilloscopes, on the other hand, can mea-
sure very high frequencies; even moderately priced oscilloscopes work at
frequencies up to hundreds of MHz.
15.12 Circuit Analysis Using Computers
Electronics Workbench and PSpice both provide a convenient way to study
the phase relationships of this chapter, as they both incorporate easy-to-use
graphing facilities. You simply set up sources with the desired magnitude
and phase values and instruct the software to compute and plot the results.
To illustrate, let us graph e1  100 sin qt V and e2  80 sin(qt  60°) V.
Use a frequency of 500 Hz.
Electronics Workbench
For Electronics Workbench, you must specify rms rather than peak values.
Thus, to plot e1  100 sin qt V, key in 70.71 V and 0 degrees. Similarly,
for e2, use 56.57 V and 60°. Here are the steps: Create the circuit of Figure
15–71 on the screen; Double click Source 1 and enter 70.71 V, 0 deg, and
500 Hz in the dialog box; Similarly, set Source 2 to 56.57 V, 60 deg, and

click Add; Repeat for Node 2 (to display e2); Click the Simulate icon; Fol-
lowing simulation, graphs e1 and e2 (Figure 15–72) appear.

For this problem, you need a sinusoidal time-varying ac voltage source. Use
VSIN (it is found in the SOURCE library.) For VSIN, you must specify the
magnitude, phase, and frequency of the source, as well as its offset (since we
do not want an offset in this problem, we will set it to zero.) Proceed as fol-
lows. Build the circuit of Figure 15–74 on the screen. Double click source 1
and in the Properties editor, select the Parts tab. Scroll right until you find a
list of source properties: then in cell VAMPL, enter 100V; in cell PHASE,
enter 0deg; in cell FREQ, enter 500Hz; and in cell VOFF, enter 0V (this
sets source ei  100 sin qt V with q  2p(500 Hz)). Click Apply, then close
the Properties editor window. Similarly, set up source 2 (making sure you
use a phase angle of 60°). Click the New Simulation icon and enter a name
(e.g., fig15-74). In the Simulation Settings box, select Time Domain and
General Settings. Set TSTOP to 2ms (to display a full cycle). Select volt-
age markers from the toolbar and place as shown. (This causes PSpice to
automatically create the photos.) Run the simulation. When the simulation is
complete, the waveforms of Figure 15–75 should appear.

I
n Chapter 15, you learned how to analyze a few simple ac circuits in the time
domain using voltages and currents expressed as functions of time. However,
this is not a very practical approach. A more practical approach is to represent ac
voltages and currents as phasors, circuit elements as impedances, and analyze
circuits in the phasor domain using complex algebra. With this approach, ac cir-
cuit analysis is handled much like dc circuit analysis, and all basic relationships
and theorems—Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s laws, mesh and nodal analysis, superpo-
sition and so on—apply. The major difference is that ac quantities are complex
rather than real as with dc. While this complicates computational details, it does
not alter basic circuit principles. This is the approach used in practice. The basic
ideas are developed in this chapter.
Since phasor analysis and the impedance concept require a familiarity with
complex numbers, we begin with a short review.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Charles Proteus Steinmetz
CHARLES STEINMETZ WAS BORN IN Breslau, Germany in 1865 and emigrated to
the United States in 1889. In 1892, he began working for the General Electric
Company in Schenectady, New York, where he stayed until his death in 1923,
and it was there that his work revolutionized ac circuit analysis. Prior to his time,
this analysis had to be carried out using calculus, a difficult and time-consuming
process. By 1893, however, Steinmetz had reduced the very complex alternating-
current theory to, in his words, “a simple problem in algebra.” The key concept
in this simplification was the phasor—a representation based on complex num-
bers. By representing voltages and currents as phasors, Steinmetz was able to
define a quantity called impedance and then use it to determine voltage and cur-
rent magnitude and phase relationships in one algebraic operation.
Steinmetz wrote the seminal textbook on ac analysis based on his method,
but at the time he introduced it he was practically the only person who under-
stood it. Now, however, it is common knowledge and one of the basic tools of
the electrical engineer and technologist. In this chapter, we learn the method and
illustrate its application to the solution of basic ac circuit problems.
In addition to his work for GE, Charles Steinmetz was a professor of electri-
cal engineering (1902–1913) and electrophysics (1913–1923) at Union Univer-
sity (now Union College) in Schenectady.

16.1
Complex Number Review
A complex number is a number of the form C  a  jb, where a and b are
real numbers and j  
1. The number a is called the real part of C and b
is called its imaginary part. (In circuit theory, j is used to denote the imagi-
nary component rather than i to avoid confusion with current i.)
Geometrical Representation
Complex numbers may be represented geometrically, either in rectangular
form or in polar form as points on a two-dimensional plane called the com-
plex plane (Figure 16–1). The complex number C  6  j8, for example,
represents a point whose coordinate on the real axis is 6 and whose coordi-
nate on the imaginary axis is 8. This form of representation is called the rec-
tangular form.
Complex numbers may also be represented in polar form by magnitude
and angle. Thus, C  10∠53.13° (Figure 16–2) is a complex number with
magnitude 10 and angle 53.13°. This magnitude and angle representation is
just an alternate way of specifying the location of the point represented by
C  a  jb.
Conversion between Rectangular and Polar Forms
To convert between forms, note from Figure 16–3 that
C  a  jb
(rectangular form)
(16–1)
C  C∠v
(polar form)
(16–2)
where C is the magnitude of C. From the geometry of the triangle,

where
C  a2
 b
2
(16–4a)
and
v  tan1b
a

(16–4b)
Equations 16–3 and 16–4 permit conversion between forms. When using
Equation 16–4b, however, be careful when the number to be converted is in
the second or third quadrant, as the angle obtained is the supplementary
angle rather than the actual angle in these two quadrants. This is illustrated
in Example 16–1 for the complex number W.

you will do), a more efficient conversion process is needed than that

tors are available that perform such conversions directly—you simply enter

Point C: Real part  4; imaginary part  3. Thus, C  4  j3. In polar form,
C  42

 4
2  5.66 and
vD  tan1 (4/4)  45°. Therefore, D  5.66∠45°, as shown in (c).
Point V: In rectangular form, V  j2. In polar form, V  2∠90°.

2  5.66
and tan1 (4/4)  45°. Inspection of Figure 16–4(d) shows, however, that
this 45° angle is the supplementary angle. The actual angle (measured from
the positive horizontal axis) is 135°. Thus, W  5.66∠135°.

Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers can be performed analytically
or graphically. Analytic addition and subtraction is most easily illustrated in
rectangular form, while graphical addition and subtraction is best illustrated
in polar form. For analytic addition, add real and imaginary parts separately.
Similarly for subtraction. For graphical addition, add vectorially as in Figure
16–5(a); for subtraction, change the sign of the subtrahend, then add, as in
Figure 16–5(b).

Multiplication and Division of Complex Numbers
These operations are usually performed in polar form. For multiplication,
multiply magnitudes and add angles algebraically. For division, divide the
magnitude of the denominator into the magnitude of the numerator, then
subtract algebraically the angle of the denominator from that of the numera-
tor. Thus, given A  A∠vA and B  B∠vB,

PRACTICE
PROBLEMS 1
1. Polar numbers with the same angle can be added or subtracted directly with-
out conversion to rectangular form. For example, the sum of 6 ∠36.87° and
4 ∠36.87° is 10 ∠36.87°, while the difference is 6 ∠36.87°  4 ∠36.87° 
2 ∠36.87°. By means of sketches, indicate why this procedure is valid.
2. To compare methods of multiplication with small integer values, convert the
numbers of Example 16–4 to polar form, multiply them, then convert the
answers back to rectangular form.
Answers:
1. Since the numbers have the same angle, their sum also has the same angle and thus,
their magnitudes simply add (or subtract).

Complex Conjugates
The conjugate of a complex number (denoted by an asterisk *) is a complex
number with the same real part but the opposite imaginary part. Thus, the
conjugate of C  C∠v  a  jb is C*  C∠v  a  jb. For example, if
C  3  j4  5∠53.13°, then C*  3  j4  5∠53.13°.
Calculators for AC Analysis
The analysis of ac circuits involves a considerable amount of complex
number arithmetic; thus, you will need a calculator that can work easily
with complex numbers. There are several inexpensive calculators on the
market that are suitable for this purpose in that they can perform all
required calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in
either rectangular or polar form without the need for conversion. This is
important, because it saves you a great deal of time and cuts down on
errors. To illustrate, consider Example 16–5. Using a calculator with only
basic complex number conversion capabilities requires that you convert
between forms as illustrated. On the other hand, a calculator with more
sophisticated complex number capabilities (such as that shown in Figure
16–6) allows you to perform the calculation without going through all the
intermediate conversion steps. You need to acquire an appropriate calculator
and learn to use it proficiently.

Complex Numbers in AC Analysis
Representing AC Voltages and Currents by Complex Numbers
As you learned in Chapter 15, ac voltages and currents can be represented as
phasors. Since phasors have magnitude and angle, they can be viewed as
complex numbers. To get at the idea, consider the voltage source of Figure
16–7(a). Its phasor equivalent (b) has magnitude Em and angle v. It therefore
can be viewed as the complex number
E  Em∠v

Transforming e  200 sin(qt  40°) V to E  200 V∠40°.

We can take advantage of this equivalence. Rather than show a source
as a time-varying voltage e(t) that we subsequently convert to a phasor, we
can represent the source by its phasor equivalent right from the start. This
viewpoint is illustrated in Figure 16–9. Since E  200 V∠40°, this represen-
tation retains all the original information of Figure 16–8 with the exception
of the sinusoidal time variation. However, since the sinusoidal waveform and
time variation is implicit in the definition of a phasor, you can easily restore
this information if it is needed.
The idea illustrated in Figure 16–9 is of fundamental importance to cir-
cuit theory. By replacing the time function e(t) with its phasor equivalent E,
we have transformed the source from the time domain to the phasor domain.
The value of this approach is illustrated next.
Before we move on, we should note that both Kirchhoff’s voltage law
and Kirchhoff’s current law apply in the time domain (i.e., when voltages
and currents are expressed as functions of time) and in the phasor domain
(i.e., when voltages and currents are represented as phasors). For example,
e  v1  v2 in the time domain can be transformed to E  V1  V2 in the
phasor domain and vice versa. Similarly for currents.
Summing AC Voltages and Currents
Sinusoidal quantites must sometimes be added or subtracted as in Figure
16–10. Here, we want the sum of e1 and e2, where e1  10 sin qt and e2 
15 sin(qt  60°). The sum of e1 and e2 can be found by adding waveforms
point by point as in (b). For example, at qt  0°, e1  10 sin 0°  0 and
e2  15 sin(0°  60°)  13 V, and their sum is 13 V. Similarly, at qt  90°,
e1  10 sin 90°  10 V and e2  15 sin(90°  60°)  15 sin 150°  7.5,
and their sum is 17.5 V. Continuing in this manner, the sum of e1  e2 (the
green waveform) is obtained.

As you can see, the process is tedious and provides no analytic expres-
sion for the resulting voltage. A better way is to transform the sources and
use complex numbers to perform the addition. This is shown in Figure 16–11.

Here, we have replaced voltages e1 and e2 with their phasor equivalents, E1
and E2, and v with its phasor equivalent, V. Since v  e1  e2, replacing v, e1,
and e2 with their phasor equivalents yields V  E1  E2. Now V can be
found by adding E1 and E2 as complex numbers. Once V is known, its corre-
sponding time equation and companion waveform can be determined.

Verify by direct substitution that v  21.8 sin(qt  36.6°) V, as in Figure 16–12,
is the sum of e1 and e2. To do this, compute e1 and e2 at a point, add them, then
compare the sum to 21.8 sin(qt  36.6°) V computed at the same point. Perform
this computation at qt  30° intervals over the complete cycle to satisfy yourself
that the result is true everywhere. (For example, at qt  0°, v  21.8 sin(qt 

IMPORTANT NOTES...
1. To this point, we have used peak values such as Vm and Im to represent the
magnitudes of phasor voltages and currents, as this has been most conve-
nient for our purposes. In practice, however, rms values are used instead.
Accordingly, we will now change to rms. Thus, from here on, the phasor V 
120 V ∠0° will be taken to mean a voltage of 120 volts rms at an angle of
0°. If you need to convert this to a time function, first multiply the rms
value by 2, then follow the usual procedure. Thus, v  2 (120) sin qt 
170 sin qt.
2. To add or subtract sinusoidal voltages or currents, follow the three steps
outlined in Example 16–6. That is,
• convert sine waves to phasors and express them in complex number
form,
• add or subtract the complex numbers,
• convert back to time functions if desired.
3. Although we use phasors to represent sinusoidal waveforms, it should be
noted that sine waves and phasors are not the same thing. Sinusoidal volt-
ages and currents are real—they are the actual quantities that you measure
with meters and whose waveforms you see on oscilloscopes. Phasors, on
the other hand, are mathematical abstractions that we use to help visualize
relationships and solve problems.
4. Quantities expressed as time functions are said to be in the time domain,
while quantities expressed as phasors are said to be in the phasor (or fre-
quency) domain. Thus, e  170 sin qt V is in the time domain, while V 
120 V ∠0° is in the phasor domain.

While it may seem silly to convert peak values to rms and then convert
rms back to peak as we did here, we did it for a reason. The reason is that very
soon, we will stop working in the time domain entirely and work only with
phasors. At that point, the solution will be complete when we have the answer
in the form I  11.3∠41.4°. (To help focus on rms, voltages and currents in
the next two examples (and in other examples to come) are expressed as an
rms value times 2.)

R, L, and C Circuits with Sinusoidal Excitation
R, L, and C circuit elements each have quite different electrical properties.
Resistance, for example, opposes current, while inductance opposes changes in
current, and capacitance opposes changes in voltage. These differences result
in quite different voltage-current relationships as you saw earlier. We now
investigate these relationships for the case of sinusoidal ac. Sine waves have
several importantcharacteristicsthatyouwilldiscoverfromthisinvestigation:
1. When a circuit consisting of linear circuit elements R, L, and C is con-
nected to a sinusoidal source, all currents and voltages in the circuit will
be sinusoidal.
2. These sine waves have the same frequency as the source and differ from it
only in terms of their magnitudes and phase angles.

Resistance and Sinusoidal AC
We begin with a purely resistive circuit. Here, Ohm’s law applies and thus,
current is directly proportional to voltage. Current variations therefore fol-
low voltage variations, reaching their peak when voltage reaches its peak,

From this, we conclude that for a purely resistive circuit, current and voltage
are in phase. Since voltage and current waveforms coincide, their phasors
also coincide (Figure 16–19).

Inductance and Sinusoidal AC
Phase Lag in an Inductive Circuit
As you saw in Chapter 13, for an ideal inductor, voltage vL is proportional to
the rate of change of current. Because of this, voltage and current are not in
phase as they are for a resistive circuit. This can be shown with a bit of cal-
culus. From Figure 16–21, vL  LdiL/dt. For a sine wave of current, you get

Voltage and current waveforms are shown in Figure 16–22, and phasors in

voltage by 90° (i.e., 1⁄4 cycle). Alternatively you can say that voltage leads
current by 90°.

For inductance, current lags voltage by 90°. Here iL is reference.

Phasors for the
waveforms of Fig. 16–22 showing the
90° lag of current.
Although we have shown that current lags voltage by 90° for the case of
Figure 16–22, this relationship is true in general, that is, current always lags
voltage by 90° regardless of the choice of reference. This is illustrated in
Figure 16–24. Here, VL is at 0° and IL at 90°. Thus, voltage vL will be a
sine wave and current iL a negative cosine wave, i.e., iL  Im cos qt. Since

iL is a negative cosine wave, it can also be expressed as iL  Im sin(qt  90°).
The waveforms are shown in (b).
Since current always lags voltage by 90° for a pure inductance, you can,
if you know the phase of the voltage, determine the phase of the current, and
vice versa. Thus, if vL is known, iL must lag it by 90°, while if iL is known, vL
must lead it by 90°.
Inductive Reactance
From Equation 16–14, we see that the ratio Vm to Im is
V

Since XL  qL  2pfL, inductive reactance is directly proportional to fre-
quency (Figure 16–28). Thus, if frequency is doubled, reactance doubles,
while if frequency is halved, reactance halves, and so on. In addition, XL is
directly proportional to inductance. Thus, if inductance is doubled, XL is
doubled, and so on. Note also that at f  0, XL  0 . This means that

Variation of Capacitive Reactance with Frequency
Since XC  1/qC  1/2pfC, the opposition that capacitance presents varies
inversely with frequency. This means that the higher the frequency, the lower
the reactance, and vice versa (Figure 16–35). At f  0 (i.e., dc), capacitive
reactance is infinite. This means that a capacitance looks like an open circuit
to dc. (We already concluded this earlier in Chapter 10.) Note that XC is also
inversely proportional to capacitance. Thus, if capacitance is doubled, XC is
halved, and so on.

16.7
The Impedance Concept
In Sections 16.5 and 16.6, we handled magnitude and phase analysis sepa-
rately. However, this is not the way it is done in practice. In practice, we rep-
resent circuit elements by their impedance, and determine magnitude and
phase relationships in one step. Before we do this, however, we need to learn
how to represent circuit elements as impedances.
Impedance
The opposition that a circuit element presents to current in the phasor
domain is defined as its impedance. The impedance of the element of Figure
16–37, for example, is the ratio of its voltage phasor to its current phasor.
Impedance is denoted by the boldface, uppercase letter Z. Thus,
Z  V
I

(ohms)
(16–25)
(This equation is sometimes referred to as Ohm’s law for ac circuits.)
Since phasor voltages and currents are complex, Z is also complex. That
is,
Z  V
I
  V
I
∠v
(16–26)
where V and I are the rms magnitudes of V and I respectively, and v is the
angle between them. From Equation 16–26,
Z  Z∠v
(16–27)
where Z  V/I. Since V  0.707Vm and I  0.707Im, Z can also be expressed
as Vm/Im. Once the impedance of a circuit is known, the current and voltage
can be determined using
I  V

and
V  IZ
(16–29)
Let usnowdetermineimpedanceforthebasic circuitelements R,L, andC.

Resistance
For a pure resistance (Figure 16–38), voltage and current are in phase. Thus,
if voltage has an angle v, current will have the same angle. For example, if
VR  VR∠v, then I  I∠v. Substituting into Equation 16–25 yields:
ZR  V
I
R  

R∠0°  R
Thus the impedance of a resistor is just its resistance. That is,
ZR  R
(16–30)
This agrees with what we know about resistive circuits, i.e., that the ratio of
voltage to current is R, and that the angle between them is 0°.
Inductance
For a pure inductance, current lags voltage by 90°. Assuming a 0° angle for
voltage (we can assume any reference we want because we are interested
only in the angle between VL and I), we can write VL  VL∠0° and I 
I∠90°. The impedance of a pure inductance (Figure 16–39) is therefore

A Final Note
The real power of the impedance method becomes apparent when you con-
sider complex circuits with elements in series, parallel, and so on. This we do

later, beginning in Chapter 18. Before we do this, however, there are some
ideas on power that you need to know. These are considered in Chapter 17.
16.8
Computer Analysis of AC Circuits
In Chapter 15, you saw how to represent sinusoidal waveforms using PSpice
and Electronics Workbench. Let us now apply these tools to the ideas of this
chapter. To illustrate, recall that in Example 16–6, we summed voltages e1 
10 sin qt V and e2  15 sin(qt  60°) V using phasor methods to obtain
their sum v  21.8 sin(qt  36.6°) V. We will now verify this summation
numerically. Since the process is independent of frequency, let us choose f 
500 Hz. This yields a period of 2 ms; thus, 1⁄2 cycle is 1 ms, 1⁄4 cycle (90°) is
500 ms, 45° is 250 ms, etc.
Electronics Workbench
As noted in Chapter 15, Electronics Workbench requires that you enter rms
values for waveforms. Thus, to represent 10 sin qt V, enter (0.7071)(10 V) 
7.071 V as its magnitude, and to represent 15 sin(qt  60°) V, enter 10.607 V.
You must also enter its angle. Procedure: Create the circuit of Figure 16–43(a)
on the screen. Set Source 1 to 7.071 V, 0 deg, and 500 Hz using the procedure
of Chapter 15. Similarly, set Source 2 to 10.607 V, 60 deg, and 500 Hz. Click
Analysis, Transient, set TSTOP to 0.002 (to run the solution out to 2 ms so
that you display a full cycle) and TMAX to 2e-06 (to avoid getting a choppy
waveform.) Highlight Node 1 (to display e1) and click Add. Repeat for Node 2
(to display v) Click Simulate. Following simulation, graphs e1 (the red curve,
left-hand scale) and v (the blue curve, right-hand scale) appear. Expand the
Analysis Graph window to full screen, then click the cursor icon and drag a
cursor to 500 ms or as close as you can get it and read values. (You should get
about 10 V for e1 and 17.5 V for v.) Scale values from the graph at 200-ms
increments and tabulate. Now replace the sources with a single source of 21.8

(Note 2) so that PSpice will automatically create the plots. Click the New
Simulation Profile icon, choose Transient, set TSTOP to 2ms (to display a
full cycle), set Maximum Step Size to 1us (to yield a smooth plot), then
click OK. Run the simulation and the waveforms of Figure 16–45 should

EXAMPLE 16–18
Compute and plot the reactance of a 12-F capacitor
over the range 10 Hz to 1000 Hz.
Solution
PSpice has no command to compute reactance; however, we can
calculate voltage and current over the desired frequency range, then plot their
ratio. This gives reactance. Procedure: Create the circuit of Figure 16–46 on
the screen. (Use source VAC here as it is the source to use for phasor analy-
ses—see Appendix A). Note its default of 0V. Double click the default value
(not the symbol) and in the dialog box, enter 120V, then click OK. Click the
New Simulations Profile icon, enter fig 16-46 for a name and then in the dia-
log box that opens, select AC Sweep/Noise. For the Start Frequency, key in
10Hz; for the End Frequency, key 1kHz; set AC Sweep type to Logarithmic,
select Decade and type 100 into the Pts/Decade (points per decade) box. Run
the simultation and a set of empty axes appears. Click Trace, Add Trace and
in the dialog box, click V1(C1), press the / key on the keyboard, then click
I(C1) to yield the ratio V1(C1)/I(C1) (which is the capacitor’s reactance).
Click OK and PSpice will compute and plot the capacitor’s reactance versus
frequency, Figure 16–47. Compare its shape to Figure 16–35. Use the cursor
to scale some values off the screen and verify each point using XC  1/qC.

appear. Using the cursor, scale voltages at 500 ms. You should get 10 V for
e1, 7.5 V for e2 and 17.5 V for v. Read values at 200-ms intervals and tabulate.
Now replace the sources of Figure 16–44 with a single source of 21.8 sin(qt
 36.6°) V, run a simulation, scale values, and compare results. They should
agree.
Another Example
PSpice makes it easy to study the response of circuits over a range of fre-
quencies. This is illustrated in Example 16–18.

Phasor Analysis
As a last example, we will show how to use PSpice to perform phasor
analysis—i.e., to solve problems with voltages and currents expressed in
phasor form. To illustrate, consider again Example 16–17. Recall, VC  70.7
V∠40°, C  10 mF, and f  1000 Hz. Procedure: Create the circuit on the
screen (Figure 16–48) using source VAC and component IPRINT (Note 1).
Double click the VAC symbol and in the Property Editor, set ACMAG to
70.7V and ACPHASE to 40deg. (See Note 2). Double click IPRINT and in
the Property Editor, type yes into cells AC, MAG, and PHASE. Click Apply
and close the editor. Click the New Simulation Profile icon, select AC
Sweep/Noise, Linear, set both Start Frequency and End Frequency to

16–48, since if it is reversed,
the phase angle of the mea-

by 180°.

select Value Only.

is 1.000  103  1000 Hz,
etc.

n Chapter 4, you studied power in dc circuits. In this chapter, we turn our
attention to power in ac circuits. In ac circuits, there are additional considera-
tions that are not present with dc. In dc circuits, for example, the only power
relationship you encounter is P  VI watts. This is referred to as real power or
active power and is the power that does useful work such as light a lamp, power
a heater, run an electric motor, and so on.
In ac circuits, you also encounter this type of power. For ac circuits that
contain reactive elements however, (i.e., inductance or capacitance), a second
component of power also exists. This component, termed reactive power, repre-
sents energy that oscillates back and forth throughout the system. For example,
during the buildup of current in an inductance, energy flows from the power
source to the inductance to create its magnetic field. When the magnetic field
collapses, this energy is returned to the circuit. This movement of energy in and
out of the inductance constitutes a flow of power. However, since it flows first in
one direction, then in the other, it contributes nothing to the average flow of
power from the source to the load. For this reason, reactive power is sometimes
referred to as wattless power. (A similar situation exists regarding power flow to
and from the electric field of a capacitor.)
For a circuit that contains resistive as well as reactive elements, some
energy is dissipated while the remainder is shuttled back and forth as described
above; thus, both active and reactive components of power are present. This
combination of real and reactive power is termed apparent power.
In this chapter, we look at all three components of power. New ideas that
emerge include the concept of power factor, the power triangle, the measurement
of power in ac circuits, and the concept of effective resistance.

PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Henry Cavendish
CAVENDISH, AN ENGLISH CHEMIST and physicist born in 1731, is included here
not for what he did for the emerging electrical field, but for what he didn’t do. A
brilliant man, Cavendish was 50 years ahead of his time, and his experiments in
electricity preceded and anticipated almost all the major discoveries that came
about over the next half century (e.g., he discovered Coulomb’s law before
Coulomb did). However, Cavendish was interested in research and knowledge
purely for its own sake and never bothered to publish most of what he learned, in
effect depriving the world of his findings and holding back the development of
the field of electricity by many years. Cavendish’s work lay unknown for nearly
a century before another great scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, had it published.
Nowadays, Cavendish is better known for his work in the gravitational field than
for his work in the electrical field. One of the amazing things he did was to
determine the mass of the earth using the rather primitive technology of his day.

FIGURE 17–2
Instantaneous power in an ac circuit. Positive p represents power to the
load; negative p represents power returned from the load.
Active Power
Since p represents the power flowing to the load, its average will be the aver-
age power to the load. Denote this average by the letter P. If P is positive,
then, on average, more power flows to the load than is returned from it. (If P
is zero, all power sent to the load is returned.) Thus, if P has a positive value,
it represents the power that is really dissipated by the load. For this reason, P
is called real power. In modern terminology, real power is also called active
power. Thus, active power is the average value of the instantaneous power,
and the terms real power, active power, and average power mean the same
17.1
Introduction
At any given instant, the power to a load is equal to the product of voltage
times current (Figure 17–1). This means that if voltage and current vary with
time, so will power. This time-varying power is referred to as instantaneous
power and is given the symbol p(t) or just p. Thus,
p  vi
(watts)
(17–1)
Now consider the case of sinusoidal ac. Since voltage and current are
positive at various times during their cycle and negative at others, instan-
taneous power may also be positive at some times and negative at others.
This is illustrated in Figure 17–2, where we have multiplied voltage times
current point by point to get the power waveform. For example, from t 
0 s to t  t1, v and i are both positive; therefore, power is positive. At t 
t1, v  0 V and thus p  0 W. From t1 to t2, i is positive and v is nega-
tive; therefore, p is negative. From t2 to t3, both v and i are negative;
therefore power is positive, and so on. As discussed in Chapter 4, a posi-
tive value for p means that power transfer is in the direction of the refer-
ence arrow, while a negative value means that it is in the opposite direc-
tion. Thus, during positive parts of the power cycle, power flows from the
source to the load, while during negative parts, it flows out of the load
back into the circuit.
The waveform of Figure 17–2 is the actual power waveform. We will
now show that the key aspects of power flow embodied in this waveform
can be described in terms of active power, reactive power, and apparent
power.

thing. (We usually refer to it simply as power.) In this book, we use the terms
interchangeably.
Reactive Power
Consider again Figure 17–2. During the intervals that p is negative, power is
being returned from the load. (This can only happen if the load contains
reactive elements: L or C.) The portion of power that flows into the load then
back out is called reactive power. Since it first flows one way then the other,
its average value is zero; thus, reactive power contributes nothing to the
average power to the load.
Although reactive power does no useful work, it cannot be ignored.
Extra current is required to create reactive power, and this current must be
supplied by the source; this also means that conductors, circuit breakers,
switches, transformers, and other equipment must be made physically larger
to handle the extra current. This increases the cost of a system.
At this point, it should be noted that real power and reactive power do
not exist as separate entities. Rather, they are components of the power
waveform shown in Figure 17–2. However, as you will see, we are able to
conceptually separate them for purposes of analysis.
17.2
Power to a Resistive Load
First consider power to a purely resistive load (Figure 17–3). Here, current is
in phase with voltage. Assume i  Imsin qt and v  Vmsin qt. Then,
p  vi  (Vmsin qt)(Imsin qt)  VmImsin2qt

(17–2)
where we have used the trigonometric relationship sin2qt  1⁄2(1  cos 2 qt)
from inside the front cover of the book.
A sketch of p versus time is shown in (b). Note that p is always positive
(except where it is momentarily zero). This means that power flows only
from the source to the load. Since none is ever returned, all power delivered
by the source is absorbed by the load. We therefore conclude that power to a
pure resistance consists of active power only. Note also that the frequency of
the power waveform is double that of the voltage and current waveforms.
(This is confirmed by the 2q in Equation 17–2.)
Average Power
Inspection of the power waveform of Figure 17–3 shows that its average
value lies half way between zero and its peak value of VmIm. That is,
P  VmIm/2
(You can also get the same result by averaging Equation 17–2 as we did in
Chapter 15.) Since V (the magnitude of the rms value of voltage) is Vm/2
and I (the magnitude of the rms value of current) is Im/2, this can be writ-
ten as P  VI. Thus, average power to a purely resistive load is
P  VI
(watts)
(17–3)
Alternate forms are obtained by substituting V  IR and I  V/R into Equa-
tion 17–3. They are
P  I2R
(watts)
(17–4)
 V2/R
(watts)
(17–5)
Thus the active power relationships for resistive circuits are the same for ac
as for dc.
17.3
Power to an Inductive Load
For a purely inductive load as in Figure 17–4(a), current lags voltage by 90°. If
we select current as reference, i  Imsin qt and v  Vmsin(qt  90°). A sketch
of p versus time (obtained by multiplying v times i) then looks as shown in (b).
Note that during the first quarter-cycle, p is positive and hence power flows to
the inductance, while during the second quarter-cycle, p is negative and all
power transferred to the inductance during the first quarter-cycle flows back
out. Similarly for the third and fourth quarter-cycles. Thus, the average power
to an inductance over a full cycle is zero, i.e., there are no power losses asso-
ciated with a pure inductance. Consequently, PL  0 W and the only power
flowing in the circuit is reactive power. This is true in general, that is, the
power that flows into and out of a pure inductance is reactive power only.
To determine this power, consider again equation 17–1.

After some trigonometric manipulation, this reduces to
pL  VI sin 2 qt
(17–6)
where V and I are the magnitudes of the rms values of the voltage and cur-
rent respectively.
The product VI in Equation 17–6 is defined as reactive power and is
given the symbol QL. Because it represents “power” that alternately flows
into, then out of the inductance, QL contributes nothing to the average power
to the load and, as noted earlier, is sometimes referred to as wattless power.
As you will soon see, however, reactive power is of major concern in the
operation of electrical power systems.
Since QL is the product of voltage times current, its unit is the volt-amp
(VA). To indicate that QL represents reactive volt-amps, an “R” is appended
to yield a new unit, the VAR (volt-amps reactive). Thus,
QL  VI

17.4
Power to a Capacitive Load
For a purely capacitive load, current leads voltage by 90°. Taking current as
reference, i  Imsin qt and v  Vmsin(qt  90°). Multiplication of v times i
yields the power curve of Figure 17–5. Note that negative and positive
loops of the power wave are identical; thus, over a cycle, the power returned
to the circuit by the capacitance is exactly equal to that delivered to it by
the source. This means that the average power to a capacitance over a full
cycle is zero, i.e., there are no power losses associated with a pure capaci-
tance. Consequently, PC  0 W and the only power flowing in the circuit is
reactive power. This is true in general, that is, the power that flows into and
out of a pure capacitance is reactive power only. This reactive power is
given by
pC  vi  VmImsin qt sin(qt  90°)
which reduces to
pC  VI sin 2 qt

Power in More Complex Circuits
The relationships described above were developed using the load of Figure
17–1. However, they hold true for every element in a circuit, no matter how
complex the circuit or how its elements are interconnected. Further, in any
circuit, total real power PT is found by summing real power to all circuit
elements, while total reactive power QT is found by summing reactive
power, taking into account that inductive Q is positive and capacitive Q is
negative.
It is sometimes convenient to show power to circuit elements symboli-
cally as illustrated in the next example.

In terms of determining total P and Q, it does not matter how the circuit
or system is connected or what electrical elements it contains. Elements can
be connected in series, in parallel, or in series-parallel, for example, and the
system can contain electric motors and the like, and total P is still found by
summing the power to individual elements, while total Q is found by alge-
braically summing their reactive powers.

The Relationship Between P, Q, and S
Until now, we have treated real, reactive, and apparent power separately. How-
ever, they are related by a very simple relationship through the power triangle.

where V and I are the magnitudes of the rms voltage and current respec-
tively. Since V  IZ and I  V/Z, S can also be written as

(VA)
(17–13)
For small equipment (such as found in electronics), VA is a convenient unit.
However, for heavy power apparatus (Figure 17–12), it is too small and kVA

In addition to its VA rating, it is common practice to rate electrical appa-
ratus in terms of its operating voltage. Once you know these two, it is easy to
determine rated current. For example, a piece of equipment rated at 250
kVA, 4.16 kV has a rated current of I  S/V  (250  103 VA)/(4.16 

The Power Triangle
Consider the series circuit of Figure 17–13(a). Let the current through the cir-
cuit be I  I∠0°, with phasor representation (b). The voltages across the resis-
tor and inductance are VR and VL respectively. As noted in Chapter 16, VR is
in phase with I, while VL leads it by 90°. Kirchhoff’s voltage law applies for
ac voltages in phasor form. Thus, V  VR  VL as indicated in (c).
The voltage triangle of (c) may be redrawn as in Figure 17–14(a) with mag-
nitudes of VR and VL replaced by IR and IXL respectively. Now multiply all quan-
tities by I. This yields sides of I2R, I2XL, and hypotenuse VI as indicated in (b).
Note that these represent P, Q, and S respectively as indicated in (c). This is
calledthe power triangle.Fromthe geometry of thistriangle, you can see that
S  P2
 Q
2
L
(17–15)
Alternatively, the relationship between P, Q, and S may be expressed as
a complex number:
S  P  jQL
(17–16a)
or
S  S∠v
(17–16b)
If the circuit is capacitive instead of inductive, Equation 17–16a becomes
S  P  jQC
(17–17)
The power triangle in this case has a negative imaginary part as indicated in
Figure 17–15.
The power relationships may be written in generalized forms as
S  P  Q
(17–18)
and
S  VI*
(17–19)
where P  P∠0°, QL  jQL, QC  jQC, and I* is the conjugate of current
I. These relationships hold true for all networks regardless of what they con-
tain or how they are configured.
When solving problems involving power, remember that P values can be
added to get PT, and Q values to get QT (where Q is positive for inductive
elements and negative for capacitive). However, apparent power values can-
not be added to get ST, i.e., ST  S1  S2  …  SN. Instead, determine PT
and QT, then use the power triangle to obtain ST.

Active and Reactive Power Equations
An examination of the power triangle of Figures 17–14 and 17–15 shows
that P and Q may be expressed respectively as
P  VI cos v  S cos v
(W)
(17–20)
and
Q  VI sin v  S sin v
(VAR)
(17–21)
where V and I are the magnitudes of the rms values of the voltage and cur-
rent respectively and v is the angle between them. P is always positive, while
Q is positive for inductive circuits and negative for capacitive circuits. Thus,
if V  120 volts, I  50 A, and v  30°, P  (120)(50)cos 30°  5196 W
and Q  (120)(50)sin 30°  3000 VAR.

17.8
Power Factor
The quantity cos v in Equation 17–20 is defined as power factor and is
given the symbol Fp. Thus,
Fp  cos v
(17–22)
From Equation 17–20, we see that Fp may be computed as the ratio of real
power to apparent power. Thus,
cos v  P/S
(17–23)
Power factor is expressed as a number or as a percent. From Equation 17–23,
it is apparent that power factor cannot exceed 1.0 (or 100% if expressed in
percent).
The power factor angle v is of interest. It can be found as
v  cos1(P/S)
(17–24)
Angle v is the angle between voltage and current. For a pure resistance,
therefore, v  0°. For a pure inductance, v  90°; for a pure capacitance,
v  90°. For a circuit containing both resistance and inductance, v will be
somewhere between 0° and 90°; for a circuit containing both resistance and
capacitance, v will be somewhere between 0° and 90°.
Unity, Lagging, and Leading Power Factor
As indicated by Equation 17–23, a load’s power factor shows how much of
its apparent power is actually real power. For example, for a purely resistive
circuit, v  0° and Fp  cos 0°  1.0. Therefore, P  VI (watts) and all the
load’s apparent power is real power. This case (Fp  1) is referred to as unity
power factor.
For a load containing only resistance and inductance, the load current
lags voltage. The power factor in this case is described as lagging. On the
other hand, for a load containing only resistance and capacitance, current
leads voltage and the power factor is described as leading. Thus, an induc-
tive circuit has a lagging power factor, while a capacitive circuit has a lead-
ing power factor.
A load with a very poor power factor can draw excessive current. This is
discussed next.

an apparent power of 1000 VA and is net capacitive with a power triangle angle
of 53.13°. Load 3 is purely resistive with power P3  200 W. Determine the
power triangle for the combined loads and the generator current. 
Answers: ST  1300 VA, vT  22.6°, I  6.25 A

Why Equipment Is Rated in VA
We now examine why electrical apparatus is rated in VA instead of watts.
Consider Figure 17–18. Assume that the generator is rated at 600 V, 120 kVA.
This means that it is capable of supplying I  120 kVA/600 V  200 A. In (a),
the generator is supplying a purely resistive load with 120 kW. Since S  P for
a purely resistive load, S  120 kVA and the generator is supplying its rated
kVA. In (b), the generator is supplying a load with P  120 kW as before, but
Q  160 kVAR. Its apparent power is therefore S  200 kVA, which means
that the generator current is I  200 kVA/600 V  333.3 A. Even though it is
supplying the same power as in (a), the generator is now greatly overloaded,
and damage may result as indicated in (b).
This example illustrates clearly that rating a load or device in terms of
power is a poor choice, as its current-carrying capability can be greatly
exceeded (even though its power rating is not). Thus, the size of electrical
apparatus (generators, interconnecting wires, transformers, etc.) required to
supply a load is governed, not by the load’s power requirements, but rather
by its VA requirements.
Power Factor Correction
The problem shown in Figure 17–18 can be alleviated by cancelling some or
all of the reactive component of power by adding reactance of the opposite
type to the circuit. This is referred to as power factor correction. If you
completely cancel the reactive component, the power factor angle is 0° and
Fp  1. This is referred to as unity power factor correction.
Residential customers are charged solely on the basis of energy used.
This is because all residential power factors are essentially the same, and the

power factor effect is simply built into the tariff. Industrial customers, on the
other hand, have widely different power factors, and the electrical utility
may have to take the power factors of these customers into account.
To illustrate, assume that the loads of Figures 17–18(a) and (b) are two
small industrial plants. If the utility based its charge solely on power, both
customers would pay the same amount. However, it costs the utility more to
supply customer (b) since larger conductors, larger transformers, larger
switchgear, and so on are required to handle the larger current. For this rea-
son, industrial customers may pay a penalty if their power factor drops
below a prescribed value.

AC Power Measurement
To measure power in an ac circuit, you need a wattmeter (since the product
of voltage times current is not sufficient to determine ac power). Figure
17–23 shows such a meter. It is a digital device that monitors voltage and
current and from these, computes and displays power. (You may also
encounter older electrodynamometer type wattmeters, i.e., electromechanical
analog instruments that use a pivoted pointer to indicate the power reading
on a scale, much like the analog meters of Chapter 2. Although their details
differ dramatically from the electronic types, the manner in which they are
connected in a circuit to measure power is the same. Thus, the measurement
techniques described below apply to them as well.)
To help understand power measurement, consider Figure 17–1. Instan-
taneous load power is the product of load voltage times load current, and
average power is the average of this product. One way to implement power
measurement is therefore to create a meter with a current sensing circuit, a
voltage sensing circuit, a multiplier circuit, and an averaging circuit. Figure
17–24 shows a simplified symbolic representation of such an instrument.
Current is passed through its current coil (CC) to create a magnetic field
proportional to the current, and a sensor circuit connected across the load
voltage reacts with this field to produce an output voltage proportional to
the product of instantaneous voltage and current (i.e., proportional to

instantaneous power). An averaging circuit averages this voltage and drives
a display to indicate average power. (The scheme used by the meter of Fig-
ure 17–23 is actually considerably more sophisticated than this because it
measures many things besides power—e.g., it measures, VARs, VA, energy,
etc. However, the basic idea is conceptually correct.)
Figure 17–25 shows how to connect a wattmeter (whether electronic or
electromechanical) into a circuit. Load current passes through its current coil
circuit, and load voltage is impressed across its voltage sensing circuit. With
this connection, the wattmeter computes and displays the product of the
magnitude of the load voltage, the magnitude of the load current, and the
cosine of the angle between them, i.e. Vload  Iload  cos vload. Thus, it measures
load power. Note the  marking on the terminals. You usually connect the
meter so that load current enters the  current terminal and the higher poten-
tial end of the load is connected to the  voltage terminal. On many meters,
the  voltage terminal is internally connected so that only three terminals
are brought out as in Figure 17–26.

When power is to be measured in a low power factor circuit, a low
power factor wattmeter must be used. This is because, for low power factor
loads, currents can be very high, even though the power is low. Thus, you
can easily exceed the current rating of a standard wattmeter and damage it,
even though the power indication on the meter is small.

It should be noted that the wattmeter reads power only for circuit elements

ments, it reads the sum of the powers.

17.10 Effective Resistance
Up to now, we have assumed that resistance is constant, independent of fre-
quency. However, this is not entirely true. For a number of reasons, the resis-
tance of a circuit to ac is greater than its resistance to dc. While this effect is
small at low frequencies, it is very pronounced at high frequencies. AC resis-
tance is known as effective resistance.
Before looking at why ac resistance is greater than dc resistance, we
need to reexamine the concept of resistance itself. Recall from Chapter 3 that
resistance was originally defined as opposition to current, that is, R  V/I.
(This is ohmic resistance.) Building on this, you learned in Chapter 4 that
P  I2R. It is this latter viewpoint that allows us to give meaning to ac resis-
tance. That is, we define ac or effective resistance as
Reff  I
P
2
()
(17–25)
where P is dissipated power (as determined by a wattmeter). From this, you
can see that anything that affects dissipated power affects resistance. For dc
and low-frequency ac, both definitions for R, i.e., R  V/I and R  P/I2 yield
the same value. However, as frequency increases, other factors cause an
increase in resistance. We will now consider some of these.
Eddy Currents and Hysteresis
The magnetic field surrounding a coil or other circuit carrying ac current
varies with time and thus induces voltages in nearby conductive material
such as metal equipment cabinets, transformer cores, and so on. The result-
ing currents (called eddy currents because they flow in circular patterns like
eddies in a brook) are unwanted and create power losses called eddy cur-
rent losses. Since additional power must be supplied to make up for these
losses, P in Equation 17–25 increases, increasing the effective resistance of
the coil.
If ferromagnetic material is also present, an additional power loss occurs
due to hysteresis effects caused by the magnetic field alternately magnetiz-
ing the material in one direction, then the other. Hysteresis and eddy current
losses are important even at low frequencies, such as the 60-Hz power sys-
tem frequency. This is discussed in Chapter 24.

Radiation Resistance
At high frequencies some of the energy supplied to a circuit escapes as radi-
ated energy. For example, a radio transmitter supplies power to an antenna,
where it is converted into radio waves and radiated into space. The resistance
effect here is known as radiation resistance. This resistance is much higher
than simple dc resistance. For example, a TV transmitting antenna may have
a resistance of a fraction of an ohm to dc but several hundred ohms effective
resistance at its operating frequency.

Skin Effect
Magnetically induced voltages created inside a conductor by its own chang-
ing magnetic field force electrons to the periphery of the conductor (Figure
17–28), resulting in a nonuniform distribution of current, with current den-
sity greatest near the periphery and smallest in the center. This phenomenon
is known as skin effect. Because the center of the wire carries little current,
its cross-sectional area has effectively been reduced, thus increasing resis-
tance. While skin effect is generally negligible at power line frequencies
(except for conductors larger than several hundred thousand circular mils), it
is so pronounced at microwave frequencies that the center of a wire carries
almost no current. For this reason, hollow conductors are often used instead
of solid wires, as shown in Figure 17–28(c).

Recall from Figure 17–4(b), energy flows into an inductor during time inter-
val 0 to T/4 and is released during time interval T/4 to T/2. The process then
repeats itself. The energy stored (and subsequently released) can thus be
found by integrating power from t  0 to t  T/4. Current at t  0 is 0 and
current at t  T/4 is Im. Using these as our limits of integration, we find

n this chapter we examine how simple circuits containing resistors, inductors,
and capacitors behave when subjected to sinusoidal voltages and currents.
Principally, we find that the rules and laws which were developed for dc circuits
will apply equally well for ac circuits. The major difference between solving dc
and ac circuits is that analysis of ac circuits requires using vector algebra.
In order to proceed successfully, it is suggested that the student spend time
reviewing the important topics covered in dc analysis. These include Ohm’s law,
the voltage divider rule, Kirchhoff’s voltage law, Kirchhoff’s current law, and
the current divider rule.
You will also find that a brief review of vector algebra will make your
understanding of this chapter more productive. In particular, you should be able
to add and subtract any number of vector quantities.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Heinrich Rudolph Hertz
HEINRICH HERTZ WAS BORN IN HAMBURG, Germany, on February 22, 1857. He
is known mainly for his research into the transmission of electromagnetic waves.
Hertz began his career as an assistant to Hermann von Helmholtz in the
Berlin Institute physics laboratory. In 1885, he was appointed Professor of
Physics at Karlsruhe Polytechnic, where he did much to verify James Clerk
Maxwell’s theories of electromagnetic waves.
In one of his experiments, Hertz discharged an induction coil with a rectan-
gular loop of wire having a very small gap. When the coil discharged, a spark
jumped across the gap. He then placed a second, identical coil close to the first,
but with no electrical connection. When the spark jumped across the gap of the
first coil, a smaller spark was also induced across the second coil. Today, more
elaborate antennas use similar principles to transmit radio signals over vast dis-
tances. Through further research, Hertz was able to prove that electromagnetic
waves have many of the characteristics of light: they have the same speed as
light; they travel in straight lines; they can be reflected and refracted; and they
can be polarized.
Hertz’s experiments ultimately led to the development of radio communica-
tion by such electrical engineers as Guglielmo Marconi and Reginald Fessenden.
Heinrich Hertz died at the age of 36 on January 1, 1894.

18.1
Ohm’s Law for AC Circuits
This section is a brief review of the relationship between voltage and current
for resistors, inductors, and capacitors. Unlike Chapter 16, all phasors are
given as rms rather than as peak values. As you saw in Chapter 17, this
approach simplifies the calculation of power.
Resistors
In Chapter 16, we saw that when a resistor is subjected to a sinusoidal volt-
age as shown in Figure 18–1, the resulting current is also sinusoidal and in
phase with the voltage.
The sinusoidal voltage v  Vmsin(qt  v) may be written in phasor form as
V  V∠v. Whereas the sinusoidal expression gives the instantaneous value of
voltage for a waveform having an amplitude of Vm (volts peak), the phasor form
has a magnitude which is the effective (or rms) value. The relationship between
the magnitude of the phasor and the peak of the sinusoidal voltage is given as
V  

Vm
2

Because the resistance vector may be expressed as ZR  R∠0°, we eval-
uate the current phasor as follows:

Chapter 18 I AC Series-Parallel Circuits
Although currents and voltages
may be shown in either time do-
main (as sinusoidal quantities) or
in phasor domain (as vectors),
resistance and reactance are
never shown as sinusoidal quan-
tities. The reason for this is that
whereas currents and voltages
vary as functions of time, resis-
tance and reactance do not.

If we wish to convert the current from phasor form to its sinusoidal
equivalent in the time domain, we would have i  Imsin(qt  v). Again, the
relationship between the magnitude of the phasor and the peak value of the
sinusoidal equivalent is given as
I  


2

The voltage and current phasors may be shown on a phasor diagram as
in Figure 18–2.
Because one phasor is a current and the other is a voltage, the relative
lengths of these phasors are purely arbitrary. Regardless of the angle v, we
see that the voltage across and the current through a resistor will always be
in phase.

AC Series Circuits
When we examined dc circuits we saw that the current everywhere in a
series circuit is always constant. This same applies when we have series ele-
ments with an ac source. Further, we had seen that the total resistance of a dc
series circuit consisting of n resistors was determined as the summation
RT  R1  R2  …  Rn
When working with ac circuits we no longer work with only resistance
but also with capacitive and inductive reactance. Impedance is a term used to
collectively determine how the resistance, capacitance, and inductance
“impede” the current in a circuit. The symbol for impedance is the letter Z
and the unit is the ohm (). Because impedance may be made up of any com-
bination of resistances and reactances, it is written as a vector quantity Z,
where
Z  Z∠v
()
Each impedance may be represented as a vector on the complex plane,
such that the length of the vector is representative of the magnitude of the
impedance. The diagram showing one or more impedances is referred to as
an impedance diagram.
Resistive impedance ZR is a vector having a magnitude of R along the
positive real axis. Inductive reactance ZL is a vector having a magnitude of

XL along the positive imaginary axis, while the capacitive reactance ZC is a
vector having a magnitude of XC along the negative imaginary axis. Mathe-
matically, each of the vector impedances is written as follows:
ZR  R∠0°  R  j0  R
ZL  XL∠90°  0  jXL  jXL
ZC  XC∠90°  0  jXC  jXC
An impedance diagram showing each of the above impedances is shown
in Figure 18–15.
All impedance vectors will appear in either the first or the fourth quad-
rants, since the resistive impedance vector is always positive.
For a series ac circuit consisting of n impedances, as shown in Figure
18–16, the total impedance of the circuit is found as the vector sum
ZT  Z1  Z2  …  Zn
(18–1)
Consider the branch of Figure 18–17.

From Figure 18–18 we see that the total impedance of the series ele-
ments consists of a real component and an imaginary component. The corre-
sponding total impedance vector may be written in either polar or rectangu-
lar form.
The rectangular form of an impedance is written as
Z  R  jX
If we are given the polar form of the impedance, then we may determine
the equivalent rectangular expression from
R  Z cos v
(18–2)
and
X  Z sin v
(18–3)

In the rectangular representation for impedance, the resistance term, R,
is the total of all resistance looking into the network. The reactance term, X,
is the difference between the total capacitive and inductive reactances. The
sign for the imaginary term will be positive if the inductive reactance is
greater than the capacitive reactance. In such a case, the impedance vector
will appear in the first quadrant of the impedance diagram and is referred to
as being an inductive impedance. If the capacitive reactance is larger, then
the sign for the imaginary term will be negative. In such a case, the imped-
ance vector will appear in the fourth quadrant of the impedance diagram and
the impedance is said to be capacitive.
The polar form of any impedance will be written in the form
Z  Z∠v
The value Z is the magnitude (in ohms) of the impedance vector Z and is
determined as follows:
Z  R2 X
2
()
(18–4)
The corresponding angle of the impedance vector is determined as
v  tan1X
R

(18–5)
Whenever a capacitor and an inductor having equal reactances are placed in
series, as shown in Figure 18–19, the equivalent circuit of the two compo-
nents is a short circuit since the inductive reactance will be exactly balanced
by the capacitive reactance.
Any ac circuit having a total impedance with only a real component, is
referred to as a resistive circuit. In such a case, the impedance vector ZT will
be located along the positive real axis of the impedance diagram and the
angle of the vector will be 0°. The condition under which series reactances
are equal is referred to as “series resonance” and is examined in greater
detail in a later chapter.
If the impedance Z is written in polar form, then the angle v will be pos-
itive for an inductive impedance and negative for a capacitive impedance. In
the event that the circuit is purely reactive, the resulting angle v will be either
90° (inductive) or 90° (capacitive). If we reexamine the impedance dia-
gram of Figure 18–18, we conclude that the original circuit is inductive.

Notice that the magnitude of the voltage across the capacitor is many
times larger than the source voltage applied to the circuit. This example illus-
trates that the voltages across reactive elements must be calculated to ensure
that maximum ratings for the components are not exceeded.
EXAMPLE 18–6
Determine the impedance Z which must be within the
indicated block of Figure 18–22 if the total impedance of the network is
13 ∠22.62°.
Solution
Converting the total impedance from polar to rectangular form,
we get
ZT  13 ∠22.62° ⇔12   j5 
Now, we know that the total impedance is determined from the summa-
tion of the individual impedance vectors, namely
ZT  2   j10   Z  12   j5 
Therefore, the impedance Z is found as
Z  12   j5   (2   j10 )
 10   j5 
 11.18 ∠26.57°
In its most simple form, the impedance Z will consist of a series combi-
nation of a 10- resistor and a capacitor having a reactance of 5 . Figure
18–23 shows the elements which may be contained within Z to satisfy the
given conditions.

The phase angle v for the impedance vector Z  Z∠v provides the phase
angle between the voltage V across Z and the current I through the imped-
ance. For an inductive impedance the voltage will lead the current by v. If
the impedance is capacitive, then the voltage will lag the current by an
amount equal to the magnitude of v.

The phase angle v is also useful for determining the average power dissi-
pated by the circuit. In the simple series circuit shown in Figure 18–26, we
know that only the resistor will dissipate power.
The average power dissipated by the resistor may be determined as fol-
lows:
P  VRI  V

R  I2R
(18–6)
Notice that Equation 18–6 uses only the magnitudes of the voltage, cur-
rent, and impedance vectors. Power is never determined by using phasor
products.
Ohm’s law provides the magnitude of the current phasor as

magnitudes of resistance and total impedance.

The power factor, Fp, is said to be leading if the current leads the volt-
age (capacitive circuit) and lagging if the current lags the voltage (inductive
circuit).
Now substituting the expression for the power factor into Equation
18–7, we express power delivered to the circuit as

PR  (4 A)2(3 )cos 0°  48 W
PC  (4 A)2(4 )cos 90°  0 W
(as expected!)
Notice that the power factor used in determining the power dissipated by each
of the elements is the power factor for that element and not the total power
factor for the circuit.
As expected, the summation of powers dissipated by the resistor and
capacitor is equal to the total power delivered by the voltage source.

Equation 18–10 is very similar to the equation for the voltage divider
rule in dc circuits. The fundamental differences in solving ac circuits are that
we use impedances rather than resistances and that the voltages found are
phasors. Because the voltage divider rule involves solving products and quo-
tients of phasors, we generally use the polar form rather than the rectangular
form of phasors.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law must apply for all circuits whether they are dc
or ac circuits. However, because ac circuits have voltages expressed in either
sinusoidal or phasor form, Kirchhoff’s voltage law for ac circuits may be
stated as follows:
The phasor sum of voltage drops and voltage rises around a closed loop is
equal to zero.
When adding phasor voltages, we find that the summation is generally
done more easily in rectangular form rather than the polar form.

where the unit of admittance is the siemens (S).
In particular, we have seen that the admittance of a resistor R is called
conductance and is given the symbol YR. If we consider resistance as a vec-

If we determine the admittance of a purely reactive component X, the
resultant admittance is called the susceptance of the component and is
assigned the symbol B. The unit for susceptance is siemens (S). In order to
distinguish between inductive susceptance and capacitive susceptance, we
use the subscripts L and C respectively. The vector forms of reactive admit-
tance are given as follows:

the complex plane in an admittance diagram as shown in Figure 18–35.
The lengths of the various vectors are proportional to the magnitudes of
the corresponding admittances. The resistive admittance vector G is shown on
the positive real axis, whereas the inductive and capacitive admittance vectors

the sum. Although the expression for two impedances is very similar to the
expression for two resistors in parallel, the difference is that the calculation
of impedance involves the use of complex algebra.

The previous example illustrates that unlike total parallel resistance, the
total impedance of a combination of parallel reactances may be much larger
that either of the individual impedances. Indeed, if we are given a parallel
combination of equal inductive and capacitive reactances, the total imped-
ance of the combination is equal to infinity (namely an open circuit). Con-
sider the network of Figure 18–41.

Because the denominator of the above expression is equal to zero, the
magnitude of the total impedance will be undefined (Z  
). The magnitude
is undefined and the algebra yields a phase angle v  0°, which indicates
that the vector lies on the positive real axis of the impedance diagram.
Whenever a capacitor and an inductor having equal reactances are placed in
parallel, the equivalent circuit of the two components is an open circuit.
The principle of equal parallel reactances will be studied in a later chap-
ter dealing with “resonance.”

with the notable exception that currents are expressed as phasors. For a par-

work may be determined using either admittance or impedance.

zero.

We may now apply the analysis techniques of series and parallel circuits in
solving more complicated circuits. As in dc circuits, the analysis of such cir-
cuits is simplified by starting with easily recognized combinations. If neces-
sary, the original circuit may be redrawn to make further simplification more
apparent. Regardless of the complexity of the circuits, we find that the fun-
damental rules and laws of circuit analysis must apply in all cases.
Consider the network of Figure 18–47.

on frequency. Consequently, the total impedance of any network having
reactive elements is also frequency dependent. Any such circuit would need to
be analyzed separately at each frequency of interest. We will examine several

Impedance versus angular frequency for the network of Figure 18–53.
The graph illustrates that the reactance of a capacitor is very high (effec-
tively an open circuit) at low frequencies. Consequently, the total impedance
of the series circuit will also be very high at low frequencies. Secondly, we
notice that as the frequency increases, the reactance decreases. Therefore, as
the frequency gets higher, the capacitive reactance has a diminished effect in
the circuit. At very high frequencies (typically for q  10qc), the impedance
of the circuit will effectively be R  1 k.

The results indicate that at dc ( f  0 Hz) the capacitor, which behaves
as an open circuit, will result in a circuit impedance of R  1 k. As the fre-
quency increases, the capacitor reactance approaches 0 , resulting in a cor-

ZT 

The above results indicate that for high frequencies, the impedance of
the circuit is essentially equal to the resistance, due to the very high imped-
ance of the inductor.
Evaluating the impedance at several angular frequencies, we have the
results of Table 18–3.
When the magnitude of the impedance ZT is plotted as a function of
angular frequency q, we get the graph of Figure 18–58.
RLC Circuits
When numerous capacitive and inductive components are combined with
resistors in series-parallel circuits, the total impedance ZT of the circuit
may rise and fall several times over the full range of frequencies. The
analysis of such complex circuits is outside the scope of this textbook.
However, for illustrative purposes we examine the simple series RLC circuit
of Figure 18–59.

The impedance ZT at any frequency will be determined as
ZT  R  jXL  jXC
 R  j(XL  XC)
At very low frequencies, the inductor will appear as a very low impedance
(effectively a short circuit), while the capacitor will appear as a very high
impedance (effectively an open circuit). Because the capacitive reactance
will be much larger than the inductive reactance, the circuit will have a very
large capacitive reactance. This results in a very high circuit impedance, ZT.
As the frequency increases, the inductive reactance increases, while
the capacitive reactance decreases. At some frequency, f0, the inductor and
the capacitor will have the same magnitude of reactance. At this frequency,
the reactances cancel, resulting in a circuit impedance which is equal to the
resistance value.
As the frequency increases still further, the inductive reactance becomes
larger than the capacitive reactance. The circuit becomes inductive and the
magnitude of the total impedance of the circuit again rises. Figure 18–60
shows how the impedance of a series RLC circuit varies with frequency.
The complete analysis of the series RLC circuit and the parallel RLC cir-
cuit is left until we examine the principle of resonance in a later chapter.

As we have seen, we may determine the impedance of any ac circuit as a vec-
tor Z  R  jX. This means that any ac circuit may now be simplified as a
series circuit having a resistance and a reactance, as shown in Figure 18–62.

Anyequivalentcircuitwillbe valid onlyatthe given frequencyofoperation.
We will now examine the technique used to convert any series impedance
into its parallel equivalent. Suppose that the two circuits of Figure 18–62 and
Figure 18–63 are exactly equivalent at some frequency. These circuits can be
equivalent only if both circuits have the same total impedance, ZT, and the
same total admittance, YT.

At this point, the circuit could be simulated and the display will resemble
actual lab results. However, we can refine the display to provide informa-
tion that is more useful. First, click on Analysis/Options. Next click on the
Instruments tab and change the following settings for the oscilloscope:
Pause after each screen
•Minimum number of time points
1000
After returning to the main window, click on the Power switch. It is neces-
sary to press the Pause/Resume button once, since the display on the oscil-
loscope will not immediately show the circuit steady state values, but
rather begins from t  0. Consequently the display will show the transient
(which in this case will last approximately 5 L/R  1 ms).
Now, we can obtain a more detailed display by clicking on the Display
Graphs button. We will use cursors and a grid to help in the analysis. The dis-
play will show several cycles of selected voltages. However, we are really
only interested in viewing one complete cycle. This is done as follows:
Click on the Properties button. Select the General tab. We enable the
cursors by selecting • All traces and Cursors On from the Cursors box.
Next, we enable the grid display by selecting Grid On from the Grid box.
The abscissa (time axis) is adjusted to show one period from t  4 ms
to t  5 ms by selecting the Bottom Axis tab and adjusting the values as
follows:

In the following example we will use the Probe postprocessor of PSpice to
show how the impedance of an RC circuit changes as a function of fre-
quency. The Probe output will provide a graphical result that is very similar
to the frequency responses determined in previous sections of this chapter.

After positioning the cursors and using the display window, we are able to
obtain various measurements for the circuit. The phase angle of the resis-
tor voltage with respect to the source voltage is found by using the differ-
ence between the cursors in the bottom axis, dx  146.88 ms. Now we

Solution
Since PSpice is unable to analyze an incomplete circuit, it is nec-
essary to provide a voltage source (and ground) for the circuit of Figure 18–72.
The input impedance is not dependent on the actual voltage used, and so we
may use any ac voltage source. In this example we arbitrarily select a voltage
of 10 V.
• Open the CIS Demo software.
• Open a new project and call it Ch 18 PSpice 1. Ensure that the Analog or
Mixed-Signal Circuit Wizard is activated.

• Enter the circuit as show in Figure 18–73. Simply click on the voltage
value and change its value to 10V from the default value of 0V. (There
must be no spaces between the magnitude and the units.

• Click on PSpice, New Simulation Profile and give a name such as Example
18-23 to the new simulation. The Simulation Settings dialog box will open.
• Click on the Analysis tab and select AC Sweep/Noise as the Analysis type.
Select General Settings from the Options box.
• Select Linear AC Sweep Type (Quite often, logarithmic frequency sweeps
such as Decade, are used). Enter the following values into the appropriate
dialog boxes. Start Frequency; 50, End Frequency: 500, Total Points: 1001.
Click OK.
• Click on PSpice and Run. The Probe postprocessor will appear on the
screen.
• Click on Trace and Add Trace. You may simply click on the appropriate
values from the list of variables and use the division symbol to result in
impedance. Enter the following expression into the Trace Expression box:
V(R1:1)/I(R1)
Notice that the above expression is nothing other than an application of
Ohm’s Law. The resulting display is shown in Figure 18–74.

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
Y
ou are working in a small industrial plant where several small motors are
powered by a 60-Hz ac line voltage of 120 Vac. Your supervisor tells you
that one of the 2-Hp motors which was recently installed draws too much cur-
rent when the motor is under full load. You take a current reading and find
that the current is 14.4 A. After doing some calculations, you determine that
even if the motor is under full load, it shouldn’t require that much current.
However, you have an idea. You remember that a motor can be repre-
sented as a resistor in series with an inductor. If you could reduce the effect of
the inductive reactance of the motor by placing a capacitor across the motor,
you should be able to reduce the current since the capacitive reactance will
cancel the inductive reactance.
While keeping the motor under load, you place a capacitor into the cir-
cuit. Just as you suspected, the current goes down. After using several differ-
ent values, you observe that the current goes to a minimum of 12.4 A. It is at
this value that you have determined that the reactive impedances are exactly
balanced. Sketch the complete circuit and determine the value of capacitance
that was added into the circuit. Use the information to determine the value of
the motor’s inductance. (Assume that the motor has an efficiency of 100%.)

o this point, we have examined only circuits having a single ac source. In
this chapter, we continue our study by analyzing multisource circuits and
bridge networks. You will find that most of the techniques used in analyzing ac
circuits parallel those of dc circuit analysis. Consequently, a review of Chapter 8
will help you understand the topics of this chapter.
Near the end of the chapter, we examine how computer techniques are used
to analyze even the most complex ac circuits. It must be emphasized that
although computer techniques are much simpler than using a pencil and calcula-
tor, there is virtually no knowledge to be gained by mindlessly entering data into
a computer. We use the computer merely as a tool to verify our results and to
provide a greater dimension to the analysis of circuits.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz
HERMANN HELMHOLTZ WAS BORN IN POTSDAM (near Berlin, Germany) on
August 31, 1821. Helmholtz was a leading scientist of the nineteenth century,
whose legacy includes contributions in the fields of acoustics, chemistry, mathe-
matics, magnetism, electricity, mechanics, optics, and physiology.
Helmholtz graduated from the Medical Institute in Berlin in 1843 and prac-
ticed medicine for five years as a surgeon in the Prussian army. From 1849 to
1871, he served as a professor of physiology at universities in Königsberg,
Bonn, and Heidelberg. In 1871, Helmholtz was appointed Professor of Physics
at the University of Berlin.
Helmholtz’ greatest contributions were as a mathematical physicist, where
his work in theoretical and practical physics led to the proof of the Law of Con-
servation of Energy in his paper “Über die Erhaltung der Kraft,” published in
1847. He showed that mechanics, heat, light, electricity, and magnetism were
simply manifestations of the same force. His work led to the understanding of
electrodynamics (the motion of charge in conductors), and his theory of the elec-
tromagnetic properties of light set the groundwork for later scientists to under-
stand how radio waves are propagated.
For his work, the German emperor Kaiser Wilhelm I made Helmholtz a
noble in 1883. This great scientist died on September 8, 1894, at the age of 73.

19.1
Dependent Sources
The voltage and current sources we have worked with up to now have been
independent sources, meaning that the voltage or current of the supply was
not in any way dependent upon any voltage or current elsewhere in the cir-
cuit. In many amplifier circuits, particularly those involving transistors, it is
possible to explain the operation of the circuits by replacing the device with
an equivalent electronic model. These models often use voltage and current
sources which have values dependent upon some internal voltage or current.
Such sources are called dependent sources. Figure 19–1 compares the sym-
bols for both independent and dependent sources.

Although the diamond is the accepted symbol for representing depen-
dent sources, many articles and textbooks still use a circle. In this textbook
we use both forms of the dependent source to familiarize the student with the
various notations. The dependent source has a magnitude and phase angle
determined by voltage or current at some internal element multiplied by a
constant, k. The magnitude of the constant is determined by parameters
within the particular model, and the units of the constant correspond to the
required quantities in the equation.

Source Conversion
When working with dc circuits, the analysis of a circuit is often simplified by
replacing the source (whether a voltage source or a current source) with its
equivalent. The conversion of any ac source is similar to the method used in
dc circuit analysis.

A voltage source E in series with an impedance Z is equivalent to a cur-
rent source I having the same impedance Z in parallel. Figure 19–4 shows
the equivalent sources.

It is important to realize that the two circuits of Figure 19–4 are equiva-
lent between points a and b. This means that any network connected to
points a and b will behave exactly the same regardless of which type of
source is used. However, the voltages or currents within the sources will sel-
dom be the same. In order to determine the current through or the voltage
across the source impedance, the circuit must be returned to its original state.

Mesh (Loop) Analysis
Mesh analysis allows us to determine each loop current within a circuit,
regardless of the number of sources within the circuit. The following steps
provide a format which simplifies the process of using mesh analysis:
1. Convert all sinusoidal expressions into equivalent phasor notation. Where
necessary, convert current sources into equivalent voltage sources.
2. Redraw the given circuit, simplifying the given impedances wherever
possible and labelling the impedances (Z1, Z2, etc.).
3. Arbitrarily assign clockwise loop currents to each interior closed loop
within a circuit. Show the polarities of all impedances using the assumed
current directions. If an impedance is common to two loops, it may be
thought to have two simultaneous currents. Although in fact two currents
will not occur simultaneously, this maneuver makes the algebraic calcula-
tions fairly simple. The actual current through a common impedance is
the vector sum of the individual loop currents.
4. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to each closed loop in the circuit, writing
each equation as follows:
	 (ZI)  	 E
If the current directions are originally assigned in a clockwise direction,
then the resulting linear equations may be simplified to the following for-
mat:
Loop 1: (	Z1)I1  (	Z12)I2  … (	Z1n)In  (	E1)
Loop 2: (	Z21)I1  (	Z2)I2  … (	Z2n)In  (	E2)
.
.
.
.
.
.
Loop n: (	Zn1)I1  (	Zn2)I2  … (	Zn)In  (	En)
In the above format, 	Zx is the summation of all impedances around
loop x. The sign in front of all loop impedances will be positive.
	Zxy is the summation of impedances which are common between
loop x and loop y. If there is no common impedance between two loops,
this term is simply set to zero. All common impedance terms in the linear
equations are given negative signs.

Chapter 19 I Methods of AC Analysis
Given a 40-mA∠0° current source in parallel with an impedance, Z. Determine
the equivalent voltage source for each of the following impedances:
a. Z  25 k∠30°.
b. Z  100  ∠90°.
c. Z  20 k  j16 k.

	Ex is the summation of voltage rises in the direction of the assumed
current Ix. If a voltage source has a polarity such that it appears as a volt-
age drop in the assumed current direction, then the voltage is given a neg-
ative sign.
5. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations using substitution or
determinants. If necessary, refer to Appendix B for a review of solving
simultaneous linear equations.

Step 4: The loop equations for the circuit of Figure 19–17 are as follows:
Loop 1: (Z1  Z2)I1  (Z2)I2  E1
Loop 2: (Z2)I1  (Z2  Z3)I2  E2

Step 5: Solve for the currents using determinants, where the elements of the
determinants are expressed as vectors.
Since the determinant of the denominator is common to both terms we find
this value first.

Nodal Analysis
Nodal analysis allows us to calculate all node voltages with respect to an
arbitrary reference point in a circuit. The following steps provide a simple
format to apply nodal analysis.
1. Convert all sinusoidal expressions into equivalent phasor notation. If nec-
essary, convert voltage sources into equivalent current sources.
2. Redraw the given circuit, simplifying the given impedances wherever
possible and relabelling the impedances as admittances (Y1, Y2, etc.).
3. Select and label an appropriate reference node. Arbitrarily assign sub-
scripted voltages (V1, V2, etc.) to each of the remaining n nodes within
the circuit.
4. Indicate assumed current directions through all admittances in the circuit.
If an admittance is common to two nodes, it is considered in each of the
two node equations.
5. Apply Kirchhoff’s current law to each of the n nodes in the circuit, writ-
ing each equation as follows:
	(YV)  	Isources
The resulting linear equations may be simplified to the following format:
Node 1: (	Y1)V1  (	Y12)V2  … (	Y1n)Vn  (	I1)
Node 2:
(	Y21)I1  (	Y2)I2  … (	Y2n)In  (	I2)
.
.
.
.
.
.
Node n:
(	Yn1)I1  (	Yn2)I2  …  (	Yn)In  (	In)

In the above format, 	Yx is the summation of all admittances con-
nected to node x. The sign in front of all node admittances will be posi-
tive.
	Yxy is the summation of common admittances between node x and
node y. If there are no common admittances between two nodes, this term
is simply set to zero. All common admittance terms in the linear equa-
tions will have a negative sign.
	Ix is the summation of current sources entering node x. If a current
source leaves the node, the current is given a negative sign.
6. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations using substitution or
determinants.

Now, by labelling the nodes and admittances, the circuit may be simplified as
shown in Figure 19–28.

Section 19.4 I Nodal Analysis

The admittances of Figure 19–28 are as follows:
Y1  0  j0.5 S
Y2  0  j0.5 S
Y3  0.5 S  j0
Y4  0  j0.5 S
Y5  1.0 S  j0.5 S
Using the assigned admittances, the nodal equations are written as follows:
Node 1:
(Y1  Y2)V1  (Y2)V2  (0)V3  I1  I2

Node 3:
(0)V1  (Y3)V2  (Y3  Y4)V3  I3  I4
By substituting the rectangular form of the admittances and current into the
above linear equations, the equations are rewritten as

In the above solution, we see that the given  network has an equivalent Y
network with one arm having a negative resistance. This result indicates that
although the  circuit has an equivalent Y circuit, the Y circuit cannot actu-
ally be constructed from real components since negative resistors do not exist
(although some active components may demonstrate negative resistance char-
acteristics). If the given conversion is used to simplify a circuit we would
treat the impedance Z1  3   j3  as if the resistance actually were a
negative value. Figure 19–32 shows the equivalent Y circuit.

If we take a moment to examine this network, we see that the cir-
cuit contains both a  and a Y. In calculating the total impedance, the solution
is easier when we convert the Y to a .
The conversion is shown in Figure 19–34.

Bridge Networks
Bridge circuits, similar to the network of Figure 19–36, are used extensively
in electronics to measure the values of unknown components.
Recall from Chapter 8 that any bridge circuit is said to be balanced
when the current through the branch between the two arms is zero. In a prac-
tical circuit, component values of very precise resistors are adjusted until the
current through the central element (usually a sensitive galvanometer) is
exactly equal to zero. For ac circuits, the condition of a balanced bridge
occurs when the impedance vectors of the various arms satisfy the following
condition:
Z
Z

3
  Z
Z


(19–9)
When a balanced bridge occurs in a circuit, the equivalent impedance of
the bridge network is easily determined by removing the central impedance
and replacing it by either an open or a short circuit. The resulting impedance
of the bridge circuit is then found as either of the following:
ZT  Z1Z2  Z3Z4
or
ZT  (Z1  Z3)(Z2  Z4)
If, on the other hand, the bridge is not balanced, then the total imped-
ance must be determined by performing a -to-Y conversion. Alterna-
tively, the circuit may be analyzed by using either mesh analysis or nodal
analysis.

EXAMPLE 19–13
Given that the circuit of Figure 19–37 is a balanced
bridge.
a. Calculate the unknown impedance, Zx.
b. Determine the values of Lx and Rx if the circuit operates at a frequency of
1 kHz.
We will now consider various forms of bridge circuits which are used in
electronic circuits to determine the values of unknown inductors and capaci-
tors. As in resistor bridges, the circuits use variable resistors together with
very sensitive galvanometer movements to ensure a balanced condition for
the bridge. However, rather than using a dc source to provide current in the
circuit, the bridge circuits use ac sources operating at a known frequency

(usually 1 kHz). Once the bridge is balanced, the value of unknown induc-
tance or capacitance may be easily determined by obtaining the reading
directly from the instrument. Most instruments using bridge circuitry will
incorporate several different bridges to enable the measurement of various
types of unknown impedances.
Maxwell Bridge
The Maxwell bridge, shown in Figure 19–38, is used to determine the
inductance and series resistance of an inductor having a relatively large
series resistance (in comparison to XL  qL).

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
In some of the examples in this chapter, we analyzed circuits that resulted
in as many as three simultaneous linear equations. You have no doubt won-
dered if there is a less complicated way to solve these circuits without the
need for using complex algebra. Computer programs are particularly useful
for solving such ac circuits. Both Electronics Workbench and PSpice have
individual strengths in the solution of ac circuits. As in previous examples,
Electronics Workbench provides an excellent simulation of how measure-
ments are taken in a lab. PSpice, on the other hand, provides voltage and
current readings, complete with magnitude and phase angle. The following
examples show how these programs are useful for examining the circuits in
this chapter.
768
Chapter 19 I Methods of AC Analysis
EXAMPLE 19–16
Use Electronics Workbench to show that the bridge cir-
cuit of Figure 19–44 is balanced. 
Solution
Recall that a bridge circuit is balanced when the current through
the branch between the two arms of the bridge is equal to zero. In this exam-
ple, we will use a multimeter set on its ac ammeter range to verify the condi-
tion of the circuit. The ammeter is selected by clicking on A and it is set to its
ac range by clicking on the sinusoidal button. Figure 19–45 shows the circuit
connections and the ammeter reading. The results correspond to the condi-
tions that were previously analyzed in Example 19–14. (Note: When using
Electronics Workbench, the ammeter may not show exactly zero current in
the balanced condition. This is due to the way the program does the calcula-
tions. Any current less than 5 mA is considered to be effectively zero.)

R2, and XL. Compare the results to those obtained in Example 19–6.

Chapter 19 I Methods of AC Analysis
ISRC from the SOURCE library and place one IPRINT part from the SPE-
CIAL library. The resistor, inductor, and capacitor are selected from the
ANALOG library and the ground symbol is selected by using the Place
ground tool.
Change the value of the current source by double clicking on the part and
moving the horizontal scroll bar until you find the field titled AC. Type 1A
40Deg into this field. A space must be placed between the magnitude and
phase angle. Click on Apply. In order for these values to be displayed on the
schematic, you must click on the Display button and then Value Only. Click on
OK to return to the properties editor and then close the editor by clicking on X.
The IPRINT part is similar to an ammeter and provides a printout of the
current magnitude and phase angle. The properties of the IPRINT part are
changed by double clicking on the part and scrolling across to show the
appropriate fields. Type OK in the AC, MAG, and PHASE fields. In order to
display the selected fields on the schematic, you must click on the Display
button and then select Name and Value after changing each field. Since we
need to measure three currents in the circuit, we could follow this procedure
two more times. However, an easier method is to click on the IPRINT part
and copy the part by using CtrlC and CtrlV. Each IPRINT
will then have the same properties.
Once the rest of the circuit is completed and wired, click on the New
Simulation Profile tool. Give the simulation a name (such as ac Branch Cur-
rents). Click on the Analysis tab and select AC Sweep/ Noise as the analysis
type. Type the following values:

he Schering bridge of Figure 19–74 (p. 779) is balanced. In this chapter,
you have learned several methods that allow you to find the current any-
where in a circuit. Using any method, determine the current through the gal-

Repeat the calculations for a value of Cx  0.09 mF. Can you make a general
statement for current through the galvanometer if Cx is smaller that the value
required to balance the bridge? What general statement can be made if the
value of Cx is larger than the value in the balanced bridge?

n this chapter we apply the superposition, Thévenin, Norton, and maximum
power transfer theorems in the analysis of ac circuits. Although the Millman
and reciprocity theorems apply to ac circuits as well as to dc circuits, they are
omitted since the applications are virtually identical with those used in analyzing
dc circuits.
Many of the techniques used in this chapter are similar to those used in
Chapter 9, and as a result, most students will find a brief review of dc theorems
useful.
This chapter examines the application of the network theorems by consider-
ing both independent and dependent sources. In order to show the distinctions
between the methods used in analyzing the various types of sources, the sections
are labelled according to the types of sources involved.
An understanding of dependent sources is particularly useful when working
with transistor circuits and operational amplifiers. Sections 20.2 and 20.5 are
intended to provide the background for analyzing the operation of feedback
amplifiers. Your instructor may find that these topics are best left until you cover
this topic in a course dealing with such amplifiers. Consequently, the omission
of sections 20.2 and 20.5 will not in any way detract from the continuity of the
important ideas presented in this chapter.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
William Bradford Shockley
SHOCKLEY WAS BORN the son of a mining engineer in London, England on Feb-
ruary 13, 1910. After graduating from the California Institute of Technology and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shockley joined Bell Telephone Labora-
tories.
With his co-workers, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, Shockley devel-
oped an improved solid-state rectifier using a germanium crystal which had been
injected with minute amounts of impurities. Unlike vacuum tubes, the resulting
diodes were able to operate at much lower voltages without the need for ineffi-
cient heater elements.
In 1948, Shockley combined three layers of germanium to produce a device
which was able to not only rectify a signal but to amplify it. Thus was developed
the first transistor. Since its humble beginning, the transistor has been improved
and decreased in size to the point where now a circuit containing thousands of
transistors can easily fit into an area not much bigger than the head of a pin.
The advent of the transistor has permitted the construction of elaborate
spacecraft, unprecedented communication, and new forms of energy generation.
Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain received the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics
for their discovery of the transistor.

20.1
Superposition Theorem—Independent Sources
The superposition theorem states the following:
The voltage across (or current through) an element is determined by sum-
ming the voltage (or current) due to each independent source.
In order to apply this theorem, all sources other than the one being consid-
ered are eliminated. As in dc circuits, this is done by replacing current sources
with open circuits and by replacing voltage sources with short circuits. The
process is repeated until the effects due to all sources have been determined.
Although we generally work with circuits having all sources at the same
frequency, occasionally a circuit may operate at more than one frequency at
a time. This is particularly true in diode and transistor circuits which use a dc
source to set a “bias” (or operating) point and an ac source to provide the
signal to be conditioned or amplified. In such cases, the resulting voltages or
currents are still determined by applying the superposition theorem. The
topic of how to solve circuits operating at several different frequencies
simultaneously is covered in Chapter 25.
784
Chapter 20 I AC Network Theorems
As in dc circuits, the superposi-
tion theorem can be applied only
to voltage and current; it cannot
be used to solve for the total
power dissipated by an element.
This is because power is not a
linear quantity, but rather fol-
lows a square-law relationship
(P  V2/R  I2R).

Superposition Theorem—Dependent Sources
Chapter 19 introduced the concept of dependent sources. We now examine
ac circuits which are powered by dependent sources. In order to analyze cir-
cuits having dependent sources, it is first necessary to determine whether the
dependent source is conditional upon a controlling element in its own circuit
or whether the controlling element is located in some other circuit.
If the controlling element is external to the circuit under consideration,
the method of analysis is the same as for an independent source. However, if
the controlling element is in the same circuit, the analysis follows a slightly
different stategy. The next two examples show the techniques used to ana-
lyze circuits having dependent sources.

EXAMPLE 20–3
Consider the circuit of Figure 20–8.
a. Determine the general expression for V in terms of I.
b. Calculate V if I  1.0 A∠0°.
c. Calculate V if I  0.3 A∠90°.
Solution
a. Since the current source in the circuit is dependent on current through an
element which is located outside of the circuit of interest, the circuit may
be analyzed in the same manner as for independent sources.

the circuit shown in Figure 20–9.

Given the circuit of Figure 20–11, calculate the voltage
across the 40- resistor.
Solution
In the circuit of Figure 20–11, the dependent source is controlled
by an element located in the circuit. Unlike the sources in the previous exam-
ples, the dependent source cannot be eliminated from the circuit since doing
so would contradict Kirchhoff’s voltage law and/or Kirchhoff’s current law.
The circuit must be analyzed by considering all effects simultaneously.

Thévenin’s Theorem—Independent Sources
Thévenin’s theorem is a method which converts any linear bilateral ac circuit
into a single ac voltage source in series with an equivalent impedance as
shown in Figure 20–13.
The resulting two-terminal network will be equivalent when it is con-
nected to any external branch or component. If the original circuit contains
reactive elements, the Thévenin equivalent circuit will be valid only at the
frequency at which the reactances were determined. The following method
may be used to determine the Thévenin equivalent of an ac circuit having
either independent sources or sources which are dependent upon voltage or
current in some other circuit. The outlined method may not be used in cir-
cuits having dependent sources controlled by voltage or current in the same
circuit.
1. Remove the branch across which the Thévenin equivalent circuit is to be
found. Label the resulting two terminals. Although any designation will
do, we will use the notations a and b.
2. Set all sources to zero. As in dc circuits, this is achieved by replacing
voltage sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits.

3. Determine the Thévenin equivalent impedance, ZTh by calculating the
impedance seen between the open terminals a and b. Occasionally it may
be necessary to redraw the circuit to simplify this process.
4. Replace the sources removed in Step 3 and determine the open-circuit volt-
age across the terminals a and b. If any of the sources are expressed in sinu-
soidal form, it is first necessary to convert these sources into an equivalent
phasor form. For circuits having more than one source, it may be necessary
to apply the superposition theorem to calculate the open-circuit voltage.
Since all voltages will be phasors, the resultant is found by using vector
algebra. The open-circuit voltage is the Thévenin voltage, ETh.
5. Sketch the resulting Thévenin equivalent circuit by including that portion
of the circuit removed in Step 1.

Norton’s Theorem—Independent Sources
Norton’s theorem converts any linear bilateral network into an equivalent
circuit consisting of a single current source and a parallel impedance as
shown in Figure 20–25.
Although Norton’s equivalent circuit may be determined by first finding
the Thévenin equivalent circuit and then performing a source conversion, we
generally use the more direct method outlined below. The steps to find the
Norton equivalent cirucuit are as follows:
1. Remove the branch across which the Norton equivalent circuit is to be
found. Label the resulting two terminals a and b.
2. Set all sources to zero.
3. Determine the Norton equivalent impedance, ZN, by calculating the imped-
ance seen between the open terminals a and b.
NOTE: Since the previous steps are identical with those followed for find-
ing the Thévenin equivalent circuit, we conclude that the Norton imped-
ance must be the same as the Thévenin impedance.
4. Replace the sources removed in Step 3 and determine the current that
would occur between terminals a and b if these terminals were shorted.
Any voltages and currents that are given in sinusoidal notation must first be
expressed in equivalent phasor notation. If the circuit has more than one
source it may be necessary to apply the superposition theorem to calculate
the total short-circuit current. Since all currents will be in phasor form, any
addition must be done using vector algebra. The resulting current is the
Norton current, IN.
5. Sketch the resulting Norton equivalent circuit by inserting that portion of
the circuit removed in Step 1.
As mentioned previously, it is possible to find the Norton equivalent cir-
cuit from the Thévenin equivalent by simply performing a source conver-
sion. We have already determined that both the Thévenin and Norton imped-
ances are determined in the same way. Consequently, the impedances must
be equivalent, and so we have
ZN  ZTh

If a circuit contains one or more dependent sources which are controlled
by an element in the circuit being analyzed, all previous methods fail to pro-
vide equivalent circuits which correctly model the circuit’s behavior. In order
to determine the Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit of a circuit having a
dependent source controlled by a local voltage or current, the following steps
must be taken:
1. Remove the branch across which the Norton equivalent circuit is to be
found. Label the resulting two terminals a and b.
2. Calculate the open-circuit voltage (Thévenin voltage) across the two ter-
minals a and b. Because the circuit contains a dependent source con-
trolled by an element in the circuit, the dependent source may not be set
to zero. Its effects must be considered together with the effects of any
independent source(s).
3. Determine the short-circuit current (Norton current) that would occur
between the terminals. Once again, the dependent source may not be set
to zero, but rather must have its effects considered concurrently with the
effects of any independent source(s).
4. Determine the Thévenin or Norton impedance by applying Equations 20–1
and 20–2 as follows:

Norton (or Thévenin) impedance appears to be 60 k30 k  20 k. How-
ever, we will find that this result is incorrect. The presence of the locally con-
trolled dependent current source makes the analysis of this circuit slightly
more complicated than a circuit that contains only an independent source. We
know, however, that the basic laws of circuit analysis must apply to all cir-
cuits, regardless of the complexity. Applying Kirchhoff’s current law at node
a gives the current through R2 as

Find the Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits exter-

There are several methods of solving this circuit. The following
approach uses the fewest number of steps.

isolate the effects due to each independent source and then apply superposi-
tion to determine the combined result. However, by converting the current
source into an equivalent voltage source, we can determine the open-circuit
voltage in one step. Figure 20–48 shows the circuit that results when the cur-
rent source is converted into an equivalent voltage source.

ily analyzed using Mesh analysis. Loop currents I1 and I2 are assigned in

Notice that the voltage in the second loop equation is expressed in terms of
the controlling voltage across R1. We will not worry about this right now. We
may simplify our calculations by ignoring the units in the above equations. It
is obvious that if all impedances are expressed in k and all voltages are in
volts, then the currents I1 and I2 must be in mA. The determinant for the
denominator is found to be

law as
V  (4 k)I1

For ac circuits, the maximum power transfer theorem states the follow-
ing:
Maximum power will be delivered to a load whenever the load has an
impedance which is equal to the complex conjugate of the Thévenin (or Nor-
ton) impedance of the equivalent circuit.
A detailed derivation of the maximum power transfer theorem is pro-
vided in Appendix C. The maximum power delivered to the load may be cal-

If the reactance of the Thévenin impedance is of the same type (both
capacitive or both inductive) as the reactance in the load, then the reactances
are added.
If one reactance is capacitive and the other is inductive, however, then
the reactances are subtracted.
To determine the power delivered to the load in such cases, the power
will need to be calculated by finding either the voltage across the load or the
current through the load. Equations 20–5 and 20–6 will no longer apply,
since these equations were based on the premise that the load impedance is
the complex conjugate of the Thévenin impedance.

Notice that the load impedance consists of a resistor in series with
a capacitance of 0.010 mF. Since the capacitive reactance is determined by the
frequency, it is quite likely that the maximum power for this circuit may only
be a relative maximum, rather than the absolute maximum. For the absolute
maximum power to be delivered to the load, the load impedance would need
to be

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
As demonstrated in Chapter 9, circuit analysis programs are very useful in
determining the equivalent circuit between specified terminals of a dc cir-
cuit. We will use similar methods to obtain the Thévenin and Norton equiva-
lents of ac circuits. Both Electronics Workbench and PSpice are useful in
analyzing circuits with dependent sources. As we have already seen, the
work in analyzing such a circuit manually is lengthy and very time consum-
ing. In this section, you will learn how to use PSpice to find the Thévenin
equivalent of a simple ac circuit. As well, we will use both programs to ana-
lyze circuits with dependent sources.

Norton equivalent of an ac circuit.

In order to adjust for the correct source voltage and current, we select VAC and
ISRC from the source library SOURCE.slb of PSpice. The values are set for
AC50V 20Deg and AC2A 0Deg respectively. The open-circuit output volt-
age is displayed using VPRINT1, which can be set to measure magnitude and
phase of an ac voltage as follows. Change the properties of VPRINT1 by dou-
ble clicking on the part. Use the horizontal scroll bar to find the AC, MAG,
and PHASE cells. Once you have entered OK in each of the cells, click on
Apply. Next, click on Display and select Name and Value from the display
properties.
Once the circuit is entered, click on the New Simulation Profile tool and
set the analysis for AC Sweep/Noise with a linear sweep beginning and end-
ing at a frequency of 31.83Hz (1 point). As before, it is convenient to disable
the Probe postprocessor from the Probe Window tab in the simulation settings
box.
As before, it is convenient to disable the Probe postprocessor prior to
simulating the design. After simulating the design, the open-circuit voltage is
determined by examining the output file of PSpice. The pertinent data from
the output file is given as
FREQ        VM(a)        VP(a)
3.183E+01   5.690E+01   -1.583E+01
The above result gives ETh  56.90 V∠15.83°. This is the same as the
value determined in Example 20–6. Recall that one way of determining the
Thévenin (or Norton) impedance is to use Ohm’s law, namely
ZTh  ZN  E
IN
Th
The Norton current is found by removing the VPRINT1 device from the
circuit of Figure 20–62 and inserting an IPRINT device (ammeter) between
terminal a and ground. The result is shown in Figure 20–63.
FIGURE 20–63

In the previous example, it was necessary to determine the Thévenin
impedance in two steps, by first solving for the Thévenin voltage and then
solving for the Norton current. It is possible to determine the value in one
step by using an additional step in the analysis. The following example
shows how to determine the Thévenin impedance for a circuit having a
dependent source. The same step may also be used for a circuit having inde-
pendent sources.
The following parts in OrCAD Capture are used to represent dependent
sources:
Voltage-controlled voltage source:
E
Current-controlled current source:
F
Voltage-controlled current source:
G
Current-controlled voltage source:
H
When using dependent sources, it is necessary to ensure that any volt-
age-controlled source is placed across the controlling voltage and any cur-
rent-controlled source is placed in series with the controlling current.
Additionally, each dependent source must have a specified gain. This
value simply provides the ratio between the output value and the control-
ling voltage or current. Although the following example shows how to use
only one type of dependent source, you will find many similarities
between the various sources.

placed across this resistor. To adjust the gain of the voltage source, double
click on the symbol. Use the scroll bar to find the GAIN cell and type 2. In
order to display this value on the schematic, you will need to click on Display
and select Name and Value from the display properties.
As in the previous circuit, you will need to first use a VPRINT1 part to
measure the open circuit voltage at terminal a. The properties of VPRINT1
are changed by typing OK in the AC, MAG, and PHASE cells. Click on Dis-
play and select Name and Value for each of the cells. Give the simulation pro-
file a name and run the simulation. The pertinent data in the PSpice output
file provides the open-circuit (Thévenin) voltage as follows.
FREQ        VM(N00431)  VP(N00431)
1.000E+03   4.000E+00   1.800E+02
The VPRINT1 part is then replaced with IPRINT, which is connected
between terminal a and ground to provide the short-circuit current. Remem-
ber to change the appropriate cells using the properties editor. The PSpice
output file gives the short-circuit (Norton) current as:
FREQ        IM(V_PRINT2)IP(V_PRINT2)
1.000E+03   1.250E-03   1.800E+02

We use 1 kHz as the frequency of operation, although any frequency may be
used. The Voltage-controlled voltage source is selected from the Sources parts
bin and the gain is adjusted by double clicking on the symbol. The Value Tab
is selected and the Voltage gain (E): is set to 2 V/V. The multimeter must be
set to measure ac volts. As expected, the reading on the multimeter is 4 V.
Current is easily measured by setting the multimeter onto its ac ammeter
range as shown in Figure 20–67. The current reading is 1.75 mA. A limitation
of Electronics Workbench modeling is that the model does not indicate the
phase angle of the voltage or current.

n this chapter, you learned how to solve for the required load impedance to
enable maximum power transfer to the load. In all cases, you worked with
load impedances that were in series with the output terminals. This will not
always be the case. The circuit shown in the accompanying figure shows a
load that consists of a resistor in parallel with an inductor.
Determine the value of the resistor RL needed to result in maximum power
delivered to the load. Although several methods are possible, you may find
that this example lends itself to being solved by using calculus.

n this chapter, we build upon the knowledge obtained in previous chapters to
observe how resonant circuits are able to pass a desired range of frequencies
from a signal source to a load. In its most simple form, the resonant circuit con-
sists of an inductor and a capacitor together with a voltage or current source.
Although the circuit is simple, it is one of the most important circuits used in
electronics. As an example, the resonant circuit, in one of its many forms, allows
us to select a desired radio or television signal from the vast number of signals
that are around us at any time.
Whereas there are various configurations of resonant circuits, they all have
several common characteristics. Resonant electronic circuits contain at least one
inductor and one capacitor and have a bell-shaped response curve centered at
some resonant frequency, fr, as illustrated in Figure 21–1.
835
CHAPTER PREVIEW
FIGURE 21–1
Response curve of a resonant circuit.
fr
V or I
f
The response curve of Figure 21–1 indicates that current or voltage will be
at a maximum at the resonant frequency, fr. Varying the frequency in either
direction results in a reduction of the voltage or current.
If we were to apply variable-frequency sinusoidal signals to a circuit con-
sisting of an inductor and capacitor, we would find that maximum energy will
transfer back and forth between the two elements at the resonant frequency. In
an ideal LC circuit (one containing no resistance), these oscillations would con-
tinue unabated even if the signal source were turned off. However, in the practi-
cal situation, all circuits have some resistance. As a result, the stored energy will
eventually be dissipated by the resistance, resulting in damped oscillations. In a
manner similar to pushing a child on a swing, the oscillations will continue
indefinitely if a small amount of energy is applied to the circuit at exactly the
right moment. This phenomenon illustrates the basis of how oscillator circuits
operate and therefore provides us with another application of the resonant cir-
cuit.
In this chapter, we examine in detail the two main types of resonant circuits:
the series resonant circuit and the parallel resonant circuit.

In this circuit, the total resistance is expressed as 
R  RG  RS  Rcoil
21.1
Series Resonance
A simple series resonant circuit is constructed by combining an ac source
with an inductor, a capacitor, and optionally, a resistor as shown in Figure
21–2a. By combining the generator resistance, RG, with the series resistance,
RS, and the resistance of the inductor coil, Rcoil, the circuit may be simplified
as illustrated in Figure 21–2b.

Chapter 21 I Resonance
Edwin Howard Armstrong—Radio Reception 
EDWIN ARMSTRONG WAS BORN in New York City on December 18, 1890. As a
young man, he was keenly interested in experiments involving radio transmis-
sion and reception.
After earning a degree in electrical engineering at Columbia University,
Armstrong used his theoretical background to explain and improve the opera-
tion of the triode vacuum tube, which had been invented by Lee de Forest.
Edwin Armstrong was able to improve the sensitivity of receivers by using
feedback to amplify a signal many times. By increasing the amount of signal
feedback, Armstrong also designed and patented a circuit which used the vac-
uum tube as an oscillator.
Armstrong is best known for conceiving the concept of superheterodyning,
in which a high frequency is lowered to a more usable intermediate frequency.
Superheterodyning is still used in modern AM and FM receivers and in numer-
ous other electronic circuits such as radar and communication equipment.
Edwin Armstrong was the inventor of FM transmission, which led to
greatly improved fidelity in radio transmission.
Although Armstrong was a brilliant engineer, he was an uncompromising
person who was involved in numerous lawsuits with Lee de Forest and the
communications giant, RCA.
After spending nearly two million dollars in legal battles, Edwin Arm-
strong jumped to his death from his thirteenth-floor apartment window on Jan-
uary 31, 1954.

Because the circuit of Figure 21–2 is a series circuit, we calculate the
total impedance as follows:
ZT  R  jXL  jXC
 R  j(XL  XC)
(21–1)
Resonance occurs when the reactance of the circuit is effectively elimi-
nated, resulting in a total impedance that is purely resistive. We know that
the reactances of the inductor and capacitor are given as follows:

(21–2)
XC  q

C
  
2p

(21–3)
Examining Equation 21–1, we see that by setting the reactances of the
capacitor and inductor equal to one another, the total impedance, ZT, is
purely resistive since the inductive reactance which is on the positive j axis
cancels the capacitive reactance on the negative j axis. The total impedance
of the series circuit at resonance is equal to the total circuit resistance, R.
Hence, at resonance,
ZT  R
(21–4)
By letting the reactances be equal we are able to determine the series
resonance frequency, qs (in radians per second) as follows:

Since the calculation of the angular frequency, q, in radians per second
is easier than solving for frequency, f, in hertz, we generally express our res-
onant frequencies in the more simple form. Further calculations of voltage
and current will usually be much easier by using q rather than f. If, however,
it becomes necessary to determine a frequency in hertz, recall that the rela-
tionship between q and f is as follows:

Because the reactive power of the inductor is equal to the reactive power
of the capacitor at resonance, we may express Q in terms of either reactive
power. Consequently, the above expression is written as follows:

Quite often, the inductor of a given circuit will have a Q expressed in
terms of its reactance and internal resistance, as follows:
Qcoil  R


If an inductor with a specified Qcoil is included in a circuit, it is necessary
to include its effects in the overall calculation of the total circuit Q.
We now examine how the Q of a circuit is used in determining other
quantities of the circuit. By multiplying both the numerator and denominator
of Equation 21–13 by the current, I, we have the following:
Qs  I
I
X
R
L  V

(21–14)
Now, since the magnitude of the voltage across the capacitor is equal to
the magnitude of the voltage across the inductor at resonance, we see that the
voltages across the inductor and capacitor are related to the Q by the follow-
ing expression:
VC  VL  QsE
at resonance
(21–15)
Note: Since the Q of a resonant circuit is generally significantly larger than
1, we see that the voltage across reactive elements can be many times greater
than the applied source voltage. Therefore, it is always necessary to ensure
that the reactive elements used in a resonant circuit are able to handle the
expected voltages and currents.

21.3
Impedance of a Series Resonant Circuit
In this section, we examine how the impedance of a series resonant circuit
varies as a function of frequency. Because the impedances of inductors and
capacitors are dependent upon frequency, the total impedance of a series res-
onant circuit must similarly vary with frequency. For algebraic simplicity,
we use frequency expressed as q in radians per second. If it becomes neces-
sary to express the frequency in hertz, the conversion of Equation 21–6 is
used.
The total impedance of a simple series resonant circuit is written as

Examining these equations for various values of frequency, we note that
the following conditions will apply:
When q  qs:
ZT  R
and
v  tan10  0°
This result is consistent with the results obtained in the previous section.
When q  qs:
As we decrease q from resonance, ZT will get larger until q  0. At this
point, the magnitude of the impedance will be undefined, corresponding to
an open circuit. As one might expect, the large impedance occurs because
the capacitor behaves like an open circuit at dc.

The angle v will occur between of 0° and 90° since the numerator of
the argument of the arctangent function will always be negative, correspond-
ing to an angle in the fourth quadrant. Because the angle of the impedance
has a negative sign, we conclude that the impedance must appear capacitive
in this region.
When q  qs:
As q is made larger than resonance, the impedance ZT will increase due
to the increasing reactance of the inductor.
For these values of q, the angle v will always be within 0° and 90°
because both the numerator and the denominator of the arctangent function
are positive. Because the angle of ZT occurs in the first quadrant, the imped-
ance must be inductive.
Sketching the magnitude and phase angle of the impedance ZT as a func-
tion of angular frequency, we have the curves shown in Figure 21–7.

Power, Bandwidth, and Selectivity of a Series
Resonant Circuit
Due to the changing impedance of the circuit, we conclude that if a constant-
amplitude voltage is applied to the series resonant circuit, the current and
power of the circuit will not be constant at all frequencies. In this section, we
examine how current and power are affected by changing the frequency of
the voltage source.
Applying Ohm’s law gives the magnitude of the current at resonance as
follows:
Imax  E
R

(21–18)
For all other frequencies, the magnitude of the current will be less than
Imax because the impedance is greater than at resonance. Indeed, when the
frequency is zero (dc), the current will be zero since the capacitor is effec-

The total power dissipated by the circuit at any frequency is given as
P  I 2R
(21–19)
Since the current is maximum at resonance, it follows that the power
must similarly be maximum at resonance. The maximum power dissipated
by the series resonant circuit is therefore given as
Pmax  I 2

The power response of a series resonant circuit has a bell-shaped curve
called the selectivity curve, which is similar to the current response. Figure

tively an open circuit. On the other hand, at increasingly higher frequencies,
the inductor begins to approximate an open circuit, once again causing the
current in the circuit to approach zero. The current response curve for a typi-
cal series resonant circuit is shown in Figure 21–8.

Examining Figure 21–9, we see that only frequencies around qs will per-
mit significant amounts of power to be dissipated by the circuit. We define
the bandwidth, BW, of the resonant circuit to be the difference between the
frequencies at which the circuit delivers half of the maximum power. The
frequencies q1 and q2 are called the half-power frequencies, the cutoff fre-
quencies, or the band frequencies.
If the bandwidth of a circuit is kept very narrow, the circuit is said to
have a high selectivity, since it is highly selective to signals occuring within
a very narrow range of frequencies. On the other hand, if the bandwidth of a
circuit is large, the circuit is said to have a low selectivity.
The elements of a series resonant circuit determine not only the fre-
quency at which the circuit is resonant, but also the shape (and hence the
bandwidth) of the power response curve. Consider a circuit in which the
resistance, R, and the resonant frequency, qs, are held constant. We find that
by increasing the ratio of L/C, the sides of the power response curve become
steeper. This in turn results in a decrease in the bandwidth. Inversely,
decreasing the ratio of L/C causes the sides of the curve to become more
gradual, resulting in an increased bandwidth. These characteristics are illus-
trated in Figure 21–10.
If, on the other hand, L and C are kept constant, we find that the band-
width will decrease as R is decreased and will increase as R is increased.
Figure 21–11 shows how the shape of the selectivity curve is dependent
upon the value of resistance. A series circuit has the highest selectivity if the
resistance of the circuit is kept to a minimum.
844
Chapter 21 I Resonance
We see from Figure 21–9 that
the selectivity curve is not per-
fectly symmetrical on both sides
of the resonant frequency. As a
result, qs is not exactly centered
between the half-power frequen-
cies. However, as Q increases,
we find that the resonant fre-
quency approaches the midpoint
between q1 and q2. In general, if
Q  10, then we assume that the
resonant frequency is at the mid-
point of half-power frequencies.

Series-to-Parallel RL and RC Conversion
As we have already seen, an inductor will always have some series resis-
tance due to the length of wire used in the coil winding. Even though the
resistance of the wire is generally small in comparison with the reactances in
the circuit, this resistance may occasionally contribute tremendously to the
overall circuit response of a parallel resonant circuit. We begin by converting
the series RL network as shown in Figure 21–17 into an equivalent parallel
RL network. It must be emphasized, however, that the equivalence is only
valid at a single frequency, q.

The previous examples illustrate two important points which are valid if
the Q of the network is large (Q  10).
1. The resistance of the parallel network is approximately Q2 larger than the
resistance of the series network.

Parallel Resonance
A simple parallel resonant circuit is illustrated in Figure 21–26. The parallel
resonant circuit is best analyzed using a constant-current source, unlike the
series resonant circuit which used a constant-voltage source.

Simple parallel resonant circuit.
Consider the LC “tank” circuit shown in Figure 21–27. The tank circuit
consists of a capacitor in parallel with an inductor. Due to its high Q and fre-
quency response, the tank circuit is used extensively in communications
equipment such as AM, FM, and television transmitters and receivers.
The circuit of Figure 21–27 is not exactly a parallel resonant circuit,
since the resistance of the coil is in series with the inductance. In order to
determine the frequency at which the circuit is purely resistive, we must first
convert the series combination of resistance and inductance into an equiva-
lent parallel network. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 21–28.
At resonance, the capacitive and inductive reactances of the circuit of
Figure 21–28 are equal. As we have observed previously, placing equal
inductive and capacitive reactances in parallel effectively results in an open
circuit at the given frequency. The input impedance of this network at reso-
nance is therefore purely resisitive and given as ZT  RP. We determine the
resonant frequency of a tank circuit by first letting the reactances of the
equivalent parallel circuit be equal:

vations.

ance will appear inductive for frequencies less than the resonant frequency, qP.
Inversely, the impedance is capacitive for frequencies greater than qP.

This is precisely the same result as that obtained when we converted an
RL series network into its equivalent parallel network. If the resistance of the
coil is the only resistance within a circuit, then the circuit Q will be equal to
the Q of the coil. However, if the circuit has other sources of resistance, then
the additional resistance will reduce the circuit Q.

are found from Ohm’s law as follows:

At resonance, the currents through the inductor and the capacitor have
the same magnitudes but are 180° out of phase. Notice that the magnitude of
current in the reactive elements at resonance is Q times greater than the
applied source current. Because the Q of a parallel circuit may be very large,
we see the importance of choosing elements that are able to handle the
expected currents.
In a manner similar to that used in determining the bandwidth of a series
resonant circuit, it may be shown that the half-power frequencies of a paral-
lel resonant circuit are

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
PSpice is particularly useful in examining the operation of resonant circuits.
The ability of the software to provide a visual display of the frequency
response is used to evaluate the resonant frequency, maximum current, and
bandwidth of a circuit. The Q of the given circuit is then easily determined.
OrCAD PSpice
Section 21.7 I Circuit Analysis Using Computers
867
EXAMPLE 21–9
Use OrCAD PSpice to obtain the frequency response for
current in the circuit of Figure 21–12. Use cursors to find the resonant fre-
quency and the bandwidth of the circuit from the observed response. Com-
pare the results to those obtained in Example 21–2.
Solution
OrCAD Capture CIS is used to input the circuit as shown in Figure 21–42. For
this example, the project is titled EXAMPLE 21-9. The voltage source used in
this example is VAC and the value is changed to AC10V 0Deg. In order to
obtain a plot of the circuit current, use the Current Into Pin tool as shown.
FIGURE 21–42
Next, we change the simulation settings by clicking on the New Simula-
tion Profile tool. Give the simulation a name such as Series Resonance and
click on Create. Once you are in the simulation settings box, click on the
Analysis tab and select AC Sweep/Noise as the analysis type. The frequency
can be swept either linearly or logarithmically (decade or octave). In this
example we select a logarithmic sweep through a decade. In the box titled AC
Sweep Type, click on Logarithmic and select Decade. Type the following

868
Chapter 21 I Resonance
values as the settings. Start Frequency: 1kHz, End Frequency: 10kHz, and
Points/Decade: 10001. Click OK.
Click on the Run tool. If there are no errors, the PROBE postprocessor
will run automatically and display I(L1) as a function of frequency. You will
notice that the selectivity curve is largely contained within a narrow range of
frequencies. We may zoom into this region as follows. Select the Plot menu,
and click on Axis Settings menu item. Click on the X Axis tab and select
User Defined Data Range. Change the values to 1kHz to 3kHz. Click OK.
The resulting display is shown in Figure 21–43.
Finally, we may use cursors to provide us with the actual resonant fre-
quency, the maximum current and the half-power frequencies. Cursors are
obtained as follows. Click on Trace, Cursor, and Display. The positions of the
cursors are adjusted by using either the mouse or the arrow and Shift
keys. The current at the maximum point of the curve is obtained by clicking
on Trace, Cursor, and Max. The dialog box provides the values of both the
frequency and the value of current. The bandwidth is determined by deter-
mining the frequencies at the half-power points (when the current is 0.707 of
the maximum value). We obtain the following results using the cursors:
Imax1.00A,fS 1.591 kHz,f1 1.514 kHz,f2 1.673 kHz, BW 0.159 kHz.
These values correspond very closely to those calculated in Example 21–2.

EXAMPLE 21–10
Use OrCAD PSpice to obtain the frequency response for
the voltage across the parallel resonant circuit of Figure 21–34. Use the
PROBE postprocessor to find the resonant frequency, the maximum voltage

obtained in Example 21–7.
Solution
This example is similar to the previous example, with minor exceptions. The
OrCAD Capture program is used to enter the circuit as shown in Figure 21–
44. The ac current source is found in the SOURCE library as IAC. The value
of the ac current source is changed AC20mA 0Deg. The Voltage Level tool
is used to provide the voltage simulation for the circuit.

FIGURE 21–44
Use the New Simulation Profile tool to set the simulation for a logarith-
mic ac sweep from 100kHz to 300kHz with a total of 10001 points per
decade. Click on the Plot menu to select the Axis Settings. Change the x-axis
to indicate a User Defined range from 100kHz to 300kHz and change the y-
axis to indicate a User Defined range from 0V to 400V. The resulting display
is shown in Figure 21–45.
As in the previous example, we use cursors to observe that the maximum
circuit voltage, Vmax  400 V, occurs at the resonance frequency as fP  159.2
kHz (1.00 Mrad/s). The half-power frequencies are determined when the out-
put voltage is at 0.707 of the maximum value, namely at f1  155.26 kHz
(0.796 Mrad/s) and f2  163.22 kHz (1.026 Mrad/s). These frequencies give a
bandwidth of BW  7.96 kHz (50.0 krad/s). The above results are the same
as those found in Example 21–7.

ou are the transmitter specialist at an AM commercial radio station,
which transmits at a frequency of 990 kHz and an average power of 10 kW.
As is the case for all commercial AM stations, the bandwidth for your station
is 10 kHz. Your transmitter will radiate the power using a 50- antenna. The
accompanying figure shows a simplified block diagram of the output stage of
the transmitter. The antenna behaves exactly like a 50- resistor connected
between the output of the amplifier and ground.
You have been asked to determine the values of L and C so that the trans-
mitter operates with the given specifications. As part of the calculations,
determine the peak current that the inductor must handle and solve for the
peak voltage across the capacitor. For your calculations, assume that the
transmitted signal is a sinusoidal.

n the previous chapter we examined how LRC resonant circuits react to
changes in frequency. In this chapter we will continue to study how changes
in frequency affect the behavior of other simple circuits. We will analyze simple
low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-reject filter circuits. The analysis will
compare the amplitude and phase shift of the output signal with respect to the
input signal.
As their names imply, low-pass and high-pass filter circuits are able to pass
low frequencies and high frequencies while blocking other frequency compo-
nents. A good understanding of these filters provides a basis for understanding
why circuits such as amplifiers and oscilloscopes are not able to pass all signals
from their input to their output.
Band-reject filters and band-pass filters are circuits which are similar to res-
onant circuits with the exception that these circuits are able to reject or pass cer-
tain frequencies without the need for LC combinations.
The analysis of all filters may be simplified by plotting the output/input
voltage relationship on a semilogarithmic graph called a Bode plot.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Alexander Graham Bell
ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on March 3, 1847.
As a young man, Bell followed his father and grandfather in research dealing
with the deaf.
In 1873, Bell was appointed professor of vocal physiology at Boston Uni-
versity. His research was primarily involved in converting sound waves into elec-
trical fluctuations. With the encouragement of Joseph Henry, who had done a
great deal of work with inductors, Bell eventually developed the telephone.
In his now-famous accident in which Bell spilled acid on himself, Bell
uttered the words “Watson, please come here. I want you.” Watson, who was on
another floor, ran to Bell’s assistance.
Although others had worked on the principle of the telephone, Alexander
Graham Bell was awarded the patent for the telephone in 1876. The telephone he
constructed was a simple device which passed a current through carbon powder.
The density of the carbon powder was determined by air fluctuations due to the
sound of a person’s voice. When the carbon was compressed, resistivity would
decrease, allowing more current.
Bell’s name has been adopted for the decibel, which is the unit used to
describe sound intensities and power gain.
Although the invention of the telephone made Bell wealthy, he continued
experimenting in electronics, air conditioning, and animal breeding. Bell died at
the age of 75 in Baddeck, Nova Scotia on August 2, 1922.

22.1
The Decibel
In electronics, we often wish to consider the effects of a circuit without
examining the actual operation of the circuit itself. This black-box approach
is a common technique used to simplify transistor circuits and for depicting
integrated circuits which may contain hundreds or even thousands of ele-
ments. Consider the system shown in Figure 22–1.

FIGURE 22–1
Although the circuit within the box may contain many elements, any
source connected to the input terminals will effectively see only the input
impedance, Zin. Similarly, any load impedance, RL, connected to the output
terminals will have voltage and current determined by certain parameters in
the circuit. These parameters usually result in an output at the load which is
easily predicted for certain conditions.
We now define several terms which are used to analyze any system hav-
ing two input terminals and two output terminals.
The power gain, AP, is defined as the ratio of output signal power to the
input signal power:
AP  P
P
o
i
u
n
t
(22–1)
We must emphasize that the total output power delivered to any load can
never exceed the total input power to a circuit. When we refer to the power
gain of a system, we are interested in only the power contained in the ac sig-
nal, so we neglect any power due to dc. In many circuits, the ac power will
be significantly less than the dc power. However, ac power gains in the order
of tens of thousands are quite possible.
The voltage gain, Av, is defined as the ratio of output signal voltage to
the input signal voltage:
Av  V
V
o
i
u
n
t
(22–2)
As mentioned, the power gain of a system may be a very large. For other
applications the output power may be much smaller than the input power,
resulting in a loss, or attenuation. Any circuit in which the output signal
power is greater than the input signal power is referred to as an amplifier.

Conversely, any circuit in which the output signal power is less than the
input signal power is referred to as an attenuator.
The ratios expressing power gain or voltage gain may be either very
large or very small, making it inconvenient to express the power gain as a
simple ratio of two numbers. The bel, which is a logarithmic unit named
after Alexander Graham Bell, was selected to represent a ten-fold increase or
decrease in power. Stated mathematically, the power gain in bels is given as
AP(bels)  log10P
P
o
i
u
n
t
Because the bel is an awkwardly large unit, the decibel (dB), which is
one tenth of a bel, has been adopted as a more acceptable unit for describing
the logarithmic change in power levels. One bel contains 10 decibels and so
the power gain in decibels is given as
AP(dB)  10 log10P
P
o
i
u
n
t
(22–3)
If the power level in the system increases from the input to the output,
then the gain in dB will be positive. If the power at the output is less than the
power at the input, then the power gain will be negative. Notice that if the
input and output have the same power levels, then the power gain will be 0 dB,
since log 1  0.

The previous example illustrates that if the power is increased or
decreased by a factor of two, the resultant power gain will be either 3 dB
or 3 dB, respectively. You will recall that in the previous chapter a similar
reference was made when the half-power frequencies of a resonant circuit
were referred to as the 3-dB down frequencies.
The voltage gain of a system may also be expressed in dB. In order to
derive the expression for voltage gain, we first assume that the input resis-
tance and the load resistance are the same value. Then, using the definition
of power gain as given by Equation 22–3, we have the following:

Applications of Decibels
Decibels were originally intended as a measure of changes in acoustical lev-
els. The human ear is not a linear instrument; rather, it responds to sounds in
a logarithmic fashion. Because of this peculiar phenomenon, a ten-fold
increase in sound intensity results in a perceived doubling of sound. This
means that if we wish to double the sound heard from a 10-W power ampli-
fier, we must increase the output power to 100 W.
The minimum sound level which may be detected by the human ear is
called the threshold of hearing and is usually taken to be I0  1  1012W/m2.
Table 22–1 lists approximate sound intensities of several common sounds.
The decibel levels are determined from the expression
b(dB)  10 log10I
I


Some electronic circuits operate with very small power levels. These
power levels may be referenced to some arbitrary level and then expressed in
decibels in a manner similar to how sound intensities are represented. For

instance, power levels may be referenced to a standard power of 1 mW. In
such cases the power level is expressed in dBm and is determined as
PdBm  10 log10

Multistage Systems
Quite often a system consists of several stages. In order to find the total volt-
age gain or power gain of the system, we would need to solve for the product
of the individual gains. The use of decibels makes the solution of a multi-
stage system easy to find. If the gain of each stage is given in decibels, then
the resultant gain is simply determined as the summation of the individual
gains.
Consider the system of Figure 22–4, which represents a three-stage
system.

The power at the output of each stage is determined as follows:
P1  AP1 Pin
P2  AP2 P1
Pout  AP3 P2

In general, for n stages the total power gain is found as the product:
APT  AP1 AP2 … APn
(22–10)
However, if we use logarithms to solve for the gain in decibels, we have the
following:
APT(dB)  10 log10APT
 10 log10 (AP1 AP2 … APn)
APT(dB)  10 log10AP1  10 log10AP2  …  10 log10APn
The total power gain in decibels for n stages is determined as the sum-
mation of the individual decibel power gains:
AP(dB)  AP1(dB)  AP2(dB)  …  APn(dB)
(22–11)
The advantage of using decibels in solving for power gains and power levels
is illustrated in the following example.

Notice that the power level (in dBm) at the output of any stage is easily
determined as the sum of the input power level (in dBm) and the gain of the
stage (in dB). It is for this reason that many communication circuits express
power levels in decibels rather than in watts.

Simple RC and RL Transfer Functions
Electronic circuits usually operate in a highly predictable fashion. If a cer-
tain signal is applied at the input of a system, the output will be determined
by the physical characteristics of the circuit. The frequency of the incoming
signal is one of the many physical conditions which determine the relation-
ship between a given input signal and the resulting output. Although outside
the scope of this text, other conditions that may determine the relationship
between the input and output signals of a given circuit are temperature, light,
radiation, etc.
For any system subjected to a sinusoidal input voltage, as shown in
Figure 22–7, we define the transfer function as the ratio of the output volt-
age phasor to the input voltage phasor for any frequency q (in radians per
second).

Notice that the definition of transfer function is almost the same as volt-
age gain. The difference is that the transfer function takes into account both
amplitude and phase shift of the voltages, whereas voltage gain is a compari-
son of only the amplitudes.
From Equation 22–12 we see that the amplitude of the transfer function
is in fact the voltage gain. The phase angle, v, represents the phase shift
between the input and output voltage phasors. The angle v will be positive if
the output leads the input and negative if the output lags the input waveform.
If the elements within the block of Figure 22–7 are resistors, then the
output and the input voltages will always be in phase. Also, since resistors
have the same value at all frequencies, the voltage gain will remain constant
at all frequencies. (This text does not take into account resistance variations
due to very high frequencies.) The resulting circuit is called an attenuator
since resistance within the block will dissipate some power, thereby reducing
(or attenuating) the signal as it passes through the circuit.
If the elements within the block are combinations of resistors, inductors,
and capacitors, then the output voltage and phase will depend on frequency

FIGURE 22–8
Frequency response of a circuit.
In order to examine the operation of the circuit over a wide range of fre-
quencies, the abscissa (horizontal axis) is usually shown as a logarithmic
scale. The ordinate (vertical axis) is usually shown as a linear scale in deci-
bels or degrees. Such graphs are said to be semilogarithmic since one scale is
logarithmic and the other is linear.
By examining the frequency response of a circuit, we are able to deter-
mine at a glance the voltage gain (in dB) and phase shift (in degrees) for any
sinusoidal input at a given frequency. For example, at a frequency of 1000
Hz, the voltage gain is 20 dB and the phase shift is 45°. This means that
the output signal is one tenth as large as the input signal and the output leads
the input by 45°.
From the frequency response of Figure 22–8, we see that the circuit
which corresponds to this response is able to pass low-frequency signals,
while at the same time partially attenuating high-frequency signals. Any cir-
cuit which passes a particular range of frequencies while blocking others is
referred to as a filter circuit. Filter circuits are usually named according to
their function, although certain filters are named after their inventors. The
filter having the response of Figure 22–8 is referred to as a stepfilter, since
the voltage gain occurs between two limits (steps). Other types of filters
which are used regularly in electrical and electronic circuits include low-
pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-reject filters.
Although the design of filters is a topic in itself, we will examine a few
of the more common types of filters which are used extensively.
Sketching Transfer Functions
Transfer functions are easily sketched on semilogarithmic graph paper by
following a few basic steps. Consider a transfer function given as
TF  
1  j
1
0.01q


Several important characteristics are evident by examining the transfer
function above. The magnitude of the transfer function (voltage gain) will be
less than 1 for all frequencies other than zero hertz (dc). As the frequency
increases, the voltage gain will decrease. For this reason, the circuit which
has the above transfer function is called a low-pass filter. Finally, we see
that the output voltage will lag the input voltage at all frequencies other than
at zero hertz.
We define the cutoff frequency, qc (also called the break frequency),
as the frequency at which the imaginary component of 1  j0.01q is equal to
the real component. This results in a voltage gain which is equal to
Av  


  0.7071
From the transfer function, we see that the cutoff frequency occurs when
the angular frequency q  qc  1/0.01  100 rad/s.At the cutoff frequency, the
voltage gain (in dB) is Av  3.0 dB and the phase shift is v  45°. To deter-

or
Av(dB)  10 log[1  (0.01q)2]
and the phase shift is given as

The frequency response of the transfer function may be sketched by
determining the voltage gain and phase shift at various angular frequencies
around the cutoff frequency. Table 22–2 provides the voltage gain and phase
shift for frequencies between q  0.01qc and q  100qc.

Frequency response of a low-pass filter circuit.
While the previous method can be used to provide a frequency response
for any circuit, it is tedious and very time-consuming. A better method is to
approximate the results as follows:
For q  qc (q  0.1qc),
Av  0 dB
v  0
For q  qc (q 	 10qc),
Av  20 log(0.01q)

The above information is plotted on semilogarithmic graphs using
straight lines to approximate the actual frequency response. Such graphs are
called Bode plots. The actual response will approach the straight lines for
frequencies much less than and much greater than the cutoff frequency. For
this reason, the straight lines are also called the asymptotes of the transfer
function. Figure 22–10 shows the Bode plot for a low-pass filter.

FIGURE 22–10
Frequency response of a low-pass filter.
The Bode plot illustrates several very important points. Because the
abscissa of the Bode plot is not measured linearly, the slope of the asymp-
totes cannot be expressed in the usual terms of rise over run. A decade is
defined as the ten-fold increase or decrease in frequency. For instance,
increasing a frequency from 10 Hz to 100 Hz represents a decade. Similarly,
a ten-fold change in angular frequency is also a decade.
An alternate way of describing a frequency change is by using the term
octave. An octave is defined as a twofold increase or decrease in frequency.
Therefore, a frequency of 400 Hz is one octave higher than a frequency of
200 Hz, while 800 Hz is two octaves higher than 200 Hz.
Both voltage gain and the phase shift have changes which are easily
expressed in terms of a decade. The asymptotic response for voltage gain
shows that the voltage gain will be approximately 0 dB for frequencies less
than qc. For frequencies above qc, the voltage gain changes at a rate of
20 dB for each decade that the frequency increases (20 dB/decade). A
change of 20 dB/decade is equivalent to having a change of 6 dB/octave.
The straight-line response for phase shift illustrates that for frequencies
less than 0.1qc the phase shift will be approximately 0°. For frequencies
above 10qc the phase shift will be essentially constant at 90°. In the region
between 0.1qc and 10qc, the phase shift may be approximated to be
45°/decade although it actually follows a curved line in this region.
All transfer functions of first-order filters (the only types of filters cov-
ered in this text) can be written as
TF 
where each of the cutoff frequencies (in radians per second) is found as

Since voltage gain is expressed in dB, the Bode plot of any transfer
function is determined from the summation of the effects due to the various
terms in the transfer function.

The combined results are shown in Figure 22–12. The total voltage gain
at each frequency is determined by summing the gain due to each term of the
transfer function. Similarly, the total phase shift at each frequency is the sum-
mation of phase shifts due to each of the two terms.
From the Bode plot of Figure 22–12, we conclude that the filter having
this response is a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 rad/s. The
high-frequency gain of this filter is 20 dB.

Writing Transfer Functions
The transfer function of any circuit is found by following a few simple steps.
As we have already seen, a properly written transfer function allows us to
easily calculate the cutoff frequencies and quickly sketch the corresponding
Bode plot for the circuit. The steps are as follows:
1. Determine the boundary conditions for the given circuit by solving for
the voltage gain when the frequency is zero (dc) and when the frequency

approaches infinity. The boundary conditions are found by using the fol-
lowing approximations:
At q  0,
inductors are short circuits,
capacitors are open circuits.
As q →,
inductors are open circuits,
capacitors are short circuits.
By using the above approximations, all capacitors and inductors are
easily removed from the circuit. The resulting voltage gain is determined
for each boundary condition by simply applying the voltage divider rule.
2. Use the voltage divider rule to write the general expression for the trans-
fer function in terms of the frequency, q. In order to simplify the algebra,
all capacitive and inductive reactance vectors are written as follows:
ZC  jq
1
C

and
ZL  jqL
3. Simplify the resulting transfer function so that it is in the following for-
mat:
TF 
Once the function is in this format, it is good practice to verify the bound-
ary conditions found in Step 1. The boundary conditions are determined
algebraically by first letting q  0 and then solving for the resulting dc
voltage gain. Next, we let q →. The various (1  jqt) terms of the
transfer function may now be approximated as simply jqt, since the
imaginary terms will be much larger (	10) than the real components. The
resultant gain will give the high-frequency gain.
4. Determine the break frequency(ies) at q  1/t (in radians per second)
where the time constants will be expressed as either t  RC or t  L/R.
5. Sketch the straight-line approximation by separately considering the
effects of each term in the transfer function.
6. Sketch the actual response of the circuit from the approximation. The
actual voltage gain response will be a smooth, continuous curve which
follows the asymptotic curve but which usually has a 3-dB difference at
the cutoff frequency(ies). This approximation will not apply if two cutoff
frequencies are separated by less than a decade. The actual phase shift
response will have the same value as the straight-line approximation at
the cutoff frequency. At frequencies one decade above and one decade
below the cutoff frequency, the actual phase shift will be 5.71° from the
straight-line approximation.
These steps will now be used in analyzing several important types of
filters.

The Low-Pass Filter
The RC Low-Pass Filter
The circuit of Figure 22–14 is referred to as a low-pass RC filter circuit since
it permits low-frequency signals to pass from the input to the output while
attenuating high frequency signals.
At low frequencies, the capacitor has a very large reactance. Conse-
quently, at low frequencies the capacitor is essentially an open circuit result-
ing in the voltage across the capacitor, Vout, to be essentially equal to the
applied voltage, Vin.
At high frequencies, the capacitor has a very small reactance, which
essentially short circuits the output terminals. The voltage at the output will
therefore approach zero as the frequency increases. Although we are able to
easily predict what happens at the two extremes of frequency, called the
boundary conditions, we do not yet know what occurs between the two
extremes.
The circuit of Figure 22–14 is easily analyzed by applying the voltage
divider rule. Namely,

power is equal to half of the maximum output power (3 dB down from the

Normalized frequency response for an RC low-pass filter. (a) Voltage

Notice that the abscissas (horizontal axes) of the graphs in Figure 22–15
are shown as a ratio of q/qc. Such a graph is called a normalized plot and
eliminates the need to determine the actual cutoff frequency, qc. The normal-
ized plot will have the same values for all low-pass RC filters. The actual
frequency response of the RC low-pass filter can be approximated from the
straight-line approximation by using the following guidelines:
1. At low frequencies (q/qc  0.1) the voltage gain is approximately 0 dB
with a phase shift of about 0°. This means that the output signal of the fil-
ter is very nearly equal to the input signal. The phase shift at q  0.1qc
will be 5.71° less than the straight-line approximation.
2. At the cutoff frequency, qc  1/RC ( fc  1/2pRC), the gain of the filter is
3 dB. This means that at the cutoff frequency, the circuit will deliver

half the power that it would deliver at very low frequencies. At the cutoff
frequency, the output voltage will lag the input voltage by 45°.
3. As the frequency increases beyond the cutoff frequency, the amplitude of
the output signal decreases by a factor of approximately ten for each ten-
fold increase in frequency; namely the voltage gain is 20 dB per
decade. The phase shift at q  10qc will be 5.71° greater than the
straight-line approximation, namely at v  84.29°. For high frequencies
(q/qc 	 10), the phase shift between the input and output voltage
approaches 90°.
The RL Low-Pass Filter
A low-pass filter circuit may be made up of a resistor and an inductor as
illustrated in Figure 22–16.
In a manner similar to that used for the RC low-pass filter, we may write
the transfer function for the circuit of Figure 22–16 as follows:

22–15. In each case, the cutoff frequency is determined as the reciprocal of
the time constant.

In order to sketch the Bode plot, we begin with the asymptotes for the
voltage gain response. The circuit will have a flat response until fc  7.96
kHz. Then the gain will drop at a rate of 20 dB for each decade increase in
frequency. Therefore, the voltage gain at 79.6 kHz will be 20 dB, and at
796 kHz the voltage gain will be 40 dB. At the cutoff frequency for the fil-
ter, the actual voltage gain response will pass through a point which is 3 dB
down from the intersection of the two asymptotes. The frequency response of
the voltage gain is shown in Figure 22–18(a).

Next, we sketch the approximate phase shift response. The phase shift at
7.96 kHz will be 45°. At a frequency one decade below the cutoff fre-
quency (at 796 Hz) the phase shift will be approximately equal to zero, while
at a frequency one decade above the cutoff frequency (at 79.6 kHz) the phase
shift will be near the maximum of 90°. The actual phase shift response will
be a curve which varies slightly from the asymptotic response, as shown in

The High-Pass Filter
The RC High-Pass Filter
As the name implies, the high-pass filter is a circuit which allows high-fre-
quency signals to pass from the input to the output of the circuit while atten-
uating low-frequency signals. A simple RC high-pass filter circuit is illus-
trated in Figure 22–23.
At low frequencies, the reactance of the capacitor will be very large,
effectively preventing any input signal from passing through to the output.
At high frequencies, the capacitive reactance will approach a short-circuit
condition, providing a very low impedance path for the signal from the input
to the output.
The transfer function of the low-pass filter is determined as follows:

Notice that the expression of Equation 22–17 is very similar to the
expression for a low-pass filter, with the exception that there is an addi-
tional term in the numerator. Since the transfer function is a complex
number which is dependent upon frequency, we may once again find the
general expressions for voltage gain and phase shift as functions of fre-
quency, q.

(22–19)
In order to sketch the asymptotic response of the voltage gain we need
to examine the effect of Equation 22–18 on frequencies around the cutoff
frequency, qc.
For frequencies q  0.1qc, the second term of the expression will be
essentially equal to zero, and so the voltage gain at low frequencies is
approximated as
Av(dB) 
 20 log q
q
c

If we substitute some arbitrary values of q into the above approxima-
tion, we arrive at a general statement. For example, by letting q  0.01qc,
we have the voltage gain as
Av  20 log(0.01)  40 dB
and by letting q  0.1qc, we have
Av  20 log(0.1)  20 dB
In general, we see that the expression Av  20 log (q/qc) may be repre-
sented as a straight line on a semilogarithmic graph. The straight line will
intersect the 0-dB axis at the cutoff frequency, qc, and have a slope of
20 dB/decade.
For frequencies q  qc, Equation 22–18 may be expressed as

For the particular case when q  qc, we have
Av(dB)  20 log 1  10 log 2  3.0 dB
which is exactly the same result that we would expect, since the actual
response will be 3 dB down from the asymptotic response.
Examining Equation 22–19 for frequencies q  0.1qc, we see that the
phase shift for the transfer function will be essentially constant at 90°, while
for frequencies q 	 10qc the phase shift will be approximately constant at
0°. At q  qc we have v  90°  45°  45°.

At low frequencies, the inductor is effectively a short circuit, which
means that the output of the circuit is essentially zero at low frequencies.

Inversely, at high frequencies, the reactance of the inductor approaches infin-
ity and greatly exceeds the resistance, effectively preventing current. The
voltage across the inductor is therefore very nearly equal to the applied input
voltage signal. The transfer function for the high-pass RL circuit is derived

The Band-Pass Filter
A band-pass filter will permit frequencies within a certain range to pass
from the input of a circuit to the output. All frequencies which fall out-
side the desired range will be attenuated and so will not appear with
appreciable power at the output. Such a filter circuit is easily constructed
by using a low-pass filter cascaded with a high-pass circuit as illustrated
in Figure 22–30.

Although the low-pass and high-pass blocks may consist of various
combinations of elements, one possibility is to construct the entire filter net-
work from resistors and capacitors as shown in Figure 22–31.
The bandwidth of the resulting band-pass filter will be approximately
equal to the difference between the two cutoff frequencies, namely,

Solution
While the transfer function for the circuit may be written by using
circuit theory, it is easier to recognize that the circuit consists of two stages:
one a low-pass stage and the other a high-pass stage. If the cutoff frequencies
of each stage are separated by more than one decade, then we may assume
that the impedance of one stage will not adversely affect the operation of the
other stage. (If this is not the case, the analysis is complicated and is outside
the scope of this textbook.) Based on the previous assumption, the transfer
function of the first stage is determined as

The band-reject filter has a response which is opposite to that of the band-
pass filter. This filter passes all frequencies with the exception of a narrow
band which is greatly attenuated. A band-reject filter constructed of a resis-

Notch filter.

For low-frequency signals, the inductor provides a low-impedance path
from the input to the output, allowing these signals to pass from the input
and appear across the resistor with minimal attenuation. Conversely, at high
frequencies the capacitor provides a low-impedance path from the input to
the output. Although the complete analysis of the notch filter is outside the
scope of this textbook, the transfer function of the filter is determined by
employing the same techniques as those previously developed.

Notice that the transfer function for the notch filter is significantly more

complex quadratic in the denominator of the transfer function, this type of
filter circuit is called a second-order filter. The design of such filters is a
separate field in electronics engineering.

Notice that the circuit uses a resonant tank circuit as part of the overall
design. As we saw in the previous chapter, the combination of the inductor
and the capacitor results in a very high tank impedance at the resonant fre-
quency. Therefore, for any signals occurring at the resonant frequency, the
output voltage is effectively zero. Because the filter circuit effectively
removes any signal occurring at the resonant frequency, the circuit is often
referred to as a notch filter. The voltage gain response of the notch filter is
shown in Figure 22–38.

Frequency response of voltage gain for a notch filter.

Actual filter design often involves using operational amplifiers to pro-
vide significant voltage gain in the passband of the filter. In addition, such
active filters have the advantage of providing very high input impedance to
prevent loading effects. Many excellent textbooks are available for assistance
in filter design.

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
Despite the complexity of designing a filter for a particular application, the
analysis of the filter is a relatively simple process when done by computer.
We have already seen the ease with which PSpice may be used to examine
the frequency response of resonant circuits. In this chapter we will again use
the Probe postprocessor of PSpice to plot the frequency characteristics of a
particular circuit. We find that with some minor adjustments, the program is
able to simultaneously plot both the voltage gain (in decibels) and the phase
shift (in degrees) of any filter circuit.
ElectronicsWorkbench provides displays that are similar to those obtained
in PSpice.The method, though, is somewhat different. Since ElectronicsWork-
bench simulates actual lab measurements, an instrument called a Bode plotter is
used by the software.As one might expect, the Bode plotter provides a graph of
the frequency response (showing both the gain and phase shift) of a circuit
even though no such instrument is found in a real electronics lab.

mine the cutoff frequencies and the bandwidth of the circuit. Compare the
results to those obtained in Example 22–10.

Solution
The OrCAD Capture program is used to enter the circuit as shown
in Figure 22–39. The analysis is set up to perform an ac sweep from 1 Hz to
100 kHz using 1001 points per decade. The signal generator is set for a mag-
nitude of 1 V and a phase shift of 0°.
In this example, we show both the voltage gain and the phase shift on the
same display. Once the PROBE screen is activated, two simultaneous dis-
plays are obtained by clicking on Plot/Add Plot to Window. We will use the
top display to show voltage gain and the bottom to show the phase shift.
PSpice does not actually calculate the voltage gain in decibels, but
rather determines the output voltage level in dBV, referenced to 1 Vrms. (It is
for this reason that we used a supply voltage of 1 V.) The voltage at point a
of the circuit is obtained by clicking on Trace/Add Trace and then selecting
DB(V(C2:1)) as the Trace Expression. Cursors are obtained by clicking on
Tools/Cursor/Display. The maximum of the function is found by clicking on
Tools/Cursor/Max. The cursor indicates that the maximum gain for the cir-
cuit is 1.02 dB. We find the bandwidth of the circuit (at the 3 dB fre-
quencies) by moving the cursors (arrow keys and Ctrl arrow keys) to the
frequencies at which the output of the circuit is at 4.02 dB. We determine
f1  0.069 kHz, f2  3.67 kHz, and BW  3.61 kHz. These results are con-
sistent with those found in Example 22–10.
Finally, we obtain a trace of the phase shift for the circuit as follows.
Click anywhere on the bottom plot. Click on Trace/Add Trace and then
select P(V(C2:1)) as the Trace Expression. The range of the ordinate is
changed by clicking on the axis, selecting the Y Axis tab, and setting the
User defined range for a value of 90d to 90d. The resulting display is
shown in Figure 22–40.

The Bode plotter is adjusted to provide the desired frequency response
by first double clicking on the instrument. Next, we click on the Magnitude

The Horizontal scale is set to log with values between 1 Hz and 100 kHz.
Similarly, the Phase is set to have a Vertical range of 90° to 90°. After click-

simultaneously by clicking on the Display Graphs icon. By using the cursor

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
A
s a designer for a sound studio, you have been asked to design bandpass
filters for a color organ that will be used to provide lighting for a rock
concert. The color organ will provide stage lighting that will correspond to
the sound level and frequency of the music. You remember from your physics
class that the human ear can perceive sounds from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
The specifications say that the audio frequency spectrum is to be divided
into three ranges. Passive RC filters will be used to isolate signals for each
range. These signals will then be amplified and used to control lights of a par-
ticular color. The low-frequency components (20 to 200 Hz) will control blue
lights, the mid-frequency components (200 Hz to 2 kHz) will control green
lights, and the high-frequency components (2 kHz to 20 kHz) will control red
lights.
Although the specifications call for 3 band-pass filters, you realize that
you can simplify the design by using a low-pass filter with a break frequency
of 200 Hz for the low frequencies and a high-pass filter with a break fre-
quency of 2 kHz for the high frequencies. To simplify your work, you decide
to use only 0.5-mF capacitors for all filters.
Show the design for each of the filters.

S
o far, we have looked only at single-phase systems. In this chapter, we con-
sider three-phase systems. (Three-phase systems differ from single-phase
systems in that they use a set of three voltages instead of one.) Three-phase sys-
tems are used for the generation and transmission of bulk electrical power. All
commercial ac power systems, for example, are three-phase systems. Not all
loads connected to a three-phase system need be three-phase, however—for
example, the electric lights and appliances used in our homes require only sin-
gle-phase ac. To get single-phase ac from a three-phase system, we simply tap
off one of its phases.
Three-phase systems may be balanced or unbalanced. If a system is bal-
anced, it can be analyzed by considering just one of its phases. (This is because,
once you know the solution for one phase, you can write down the solutions to
the other two phases with no further computation other than the addition or sub-
traction of an angle.) This is significant because it makes the analysis of bal-
anced systems only slightly more complex than the analysis of single-phase sys-
tems. Since most systems operate close to balance, many practical problems can
be dealt with by assuming balance. This is the approach used in practice.
Three-phase systems possess economic and operating advantages over sin-
gle-phase systems. For example, for the same power output, three-phase genera-
tors cost less than single-phase generators, produce uniform power rather than
pulsating power, and operate with less vibration and noise.
We begin the chapter with a look at three-phase voltage generation.

CHAPTER PREVIEW
PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
Nikola Tesla
AS NOTED IN CHAPTER 15, the advent of the commercial electrical power age
began with a fierce battle between Thomas A. Edison and George Westinghouse
over the use of dc versus ac for the infant electrical power industry. Edison vig-
orously promoted dc while Westinghouse promoted ac. Tesla settled the argu-
ment in favor of ac with his development of the three-phase power system, the
induction motor, and other ac devices. Coupled with the creation of a practical
power transformer, these developments made long-distance transmission of elec-
trical energy possible and ac became the clear winner.
Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia in 1856 and emigrated to the United
States in 1884. During part of his career, he was associated with Edison, but the
two had a falling out and became bitter rivals. Tesla made many important con-
tributions in the fields of electricity and magnetism (he held over 700 patents),
and the SI unit of magnetic flux density (the “tesla”) is named after him. Tesla
was also primarily responsible for the selection of 60 Hz as the standard power
system frequency in North America and much of the world.

23.1
Three-Phase Voltage Generation
Three-phase generators have three sets of windings and thus produce three
ac voltages instead of one. To get at the idea, consider first the elementary
single-phase generator of Figure 23–1. As coil AA rotates, it produces a
sinusoidal waveform eAA as indicated in (b). This voltage can be represented
by phasor EAA as shown in (c).

If two more windings are added as in Figure 23–2, two additional volt-
ages are generated. Since these windings are identical with AA (except for
their position on the rotor), they produce identical voltages. However, since
coil BB is placed 120° behind coil AA, voltage eBB lags eAA by 120°; simi-
larly, coil CC, which is placed ahead of coil AA by 120°, produces voltage
eCC that leads by 120°. Waveforms are shown in (b) and phasors in (c). As
indicated, the generated voltages are equal in magnitude and phase displaced

120°. Assuming an rms value of 120 V and a reference position of 0° for
phasor EAA for example, yields EAA  120 V∠0°, EBB  120 V∠120° and
ECC  120 V∠120°. Such a set of voltages is said to be balanced. Because
of this fixed relationship between balanced voltages, you can, if you know
one voltage, easily determine the other two.

A Comment on Generator
Construction
Except for small generators, most
three-phase generators do not
actually use the construction of
Figure 23–2. Instead, they use a
fixed set of windings and a rotat-
ing magnetic field. The design
of Figure 23–2 was chosen to
illustrate three-phase voltage
generation because it is easier to
visualize.
NOTES...
23.2
Basic Three-Phase Circuit Connections
The generator of Figure 23–2 has three independent windings: AA, BB, and
CC. As a first thought, you might try connecting loads using six wires as in
Figure 23–3(a). This will work, although it is not a scheme that is used in
practice. Nonetheless, some useful insights can be gained from it. To illus-
trate, assume a voltage of 120 V for each coil and a 12-ohm resistive load.
With EAA as reference, Ohm’s law applied to each circuit yields
IA  EAA/R  120 V∠0°/12   10 A∠0°
IB  EBB/R  120 V∠120°/12   10 A∠120°
IC  ECC/R  120 V∠120°/12   10 A∠120°
These currents form a balanced set, as shown in Figure 23–3(b).
Four-Wire and Three-Wire Systems
Each load in Figure 23–3(a) has its own return wire. What if you replace
them with a single wire as in (c)? By Kirchhoff’s current law, the current in
this wire (which we call the neutral) is the phasor sum of IA, IB, and IC. For
the balanced 12-ohm load,
IN  IA  IB  IC  10 A∠0°  10 A∠120°  10 A∠120°
 (10 A  j0)  (5 A  j8.66 A)  (5 A  j8.66 A)  0 amps
Thus, the return wire carries no current at all! (This result is always true
regardless of load impedance, provided the load is balanced, i.e., all phase
impedances are the same.) In practice, power systems are normally operated
close to balance. Thus, the return current, while not necessarily zero, will be
quite small, and the neutral wire can be made smaller than the other three
conductors. This configuration is called a four-wire system and is one of the
systems used in practice.

The outgoing lines of Figure 23–3(c) are called line or phase conduc-
tors. They are the conductors that you see suspended by insulators on trans-
mission line towers.
Symbology
Having joined points A, B, and C in Figure 23–3(c), we now drop the A, B,
and C notation and simply call the common point N. The voltages are then
renamed EAN, EBN, and ECN. They are known as line-to-neutral voltages.
Standard Representation
Three-phase circuits are not usually drawn as in Figure 23–3. Rather, they
are usually drawn as in Figure 23–4. (Figure 23–4(a), for example, shows
Figure 23–3(c) redrawn in standard form.) Note that coil symbols are used to
represent generator windings rather than the circle symbol that we use for
single phase.
As Figure 23–4(a) shows, the circuit that we have been looking at is a
four-wire, wye-wye (Y-Y) circuit. A variation, the three-wire wye-wye cir-
cuit, is shown in (b). Three-wire wye-wye circuits may be used if the load
can be guaranteed to remain balanced, since under balanced conditions the
neutral conductor carries no current. However, for practical reasons (dis-
cussed in Section 23.7), most wye-wye systems use four wires.
Delta-Connected Generators
Now consider  connection of the generator windings. Theoretically, this is
possible as indicated in Figure 23–5. However, there are practical difficul-
ties. For example, when generators are loaded, distortions occur in the coil

voltages due to magnetic fluxes produced by load currents. In Y-connected
generators, these distortions cancel, but in -connected generators, they do
not. These distortions create a third harmonic current that circulates within
the windings of the -connected generator, lowering its efficiency. (You
will learn about third harmonics in Chapter 25). For this and other reasons,
-connected generators are seldom used and will not be discussed in this
book.
Neutral-Neutral Voltage in a Wye-Wye Circuit
In a balanced Y-Y system, neutral current is zero because line currents sum
to zero. As a consequence, the voltage between neutral points is zero. To see
why, consider again Figure 23–4(a). Assume that the wire joining points n
and N has impedance ZnN. This yields voltage VnN  IN  ZnN. But since
IN  0, VnN  0, regardless of the value of ZnN. Even if the neutral conductor
is absent as in (b), VnN is still zero. Thus, in a balanced Y-Y system, the volt-
age between neutral points is zero.

EXAMPLE 23–1
Assume the circuits of Figure 23–4(a) and (b) are bal-
anced. If EAN  247 V∠0°, what are Van, Vbn, and Vcn?
Solution
In both cases, the voltage VnN between neutral points is zero.
Thus, by KVL, Van  EAN  247 V∠0°. Since the system is balanced, Vbn
 247 V∠120 and Vcn  247 V∠120°.
Phase Sequence
Phase sequence refers to the order in which three-phase voltages are gener-
ated. Consider again Figure 23–2. As the rotor turns in the counterclockwise
direction, voltages are generated in the sequence eAA, eBB, and eCC as indi-
cated by waveforms (b) and the phasor set (c) and the system is said to have
an ABC phase sequence. On the other hand, if the direction of rotation were
reversed, the sequence would be ACB. Sequence ABC is called the positive

phase sequence and is the sequence generated in practice. It is therefore the
only sequence considered in this book.
While voltages are generated in the sequence ABC, the order of voltages
applied to a load depends on how you connect it to the source. For most bal-
anced loads, phase sequence doesn’t matter. However, for three-phase
motors, the order is important, since if you reverse any pair of wires, the
direction of the motor’s rotation will reverse.
23.3
Basic Three-Phase Relationships
To keep track of voltages and currents, we use the symbols and notations of
Figure 23–6. Capital letter subscripts are used at the source and lowercase
letters at the load. As usual, E is used for source voltage and V for voltage
drops.

FIGURE 23–6
Symbols and notation for 3-phase voltages and currents.

Definitions
Line (also called line-to-line) voltages are voltages between lines. Thus,
EAB, EBC, and ECA are line-to-line voltages at the generator, while Vab, Vbc,
and Vca are line-to-line voltages at the load.
Phase voltages are voltages across phases. For a Y load, phases are
defined from line to neutral as indicated in (a); thus, Van, Vbn, and Vcn are
phase voltages for a Y load. For a  load, phases are defined from line to line
as shown in (b); thus, Vab, Vbc, and Vca are phase voltages for a . As you
can see, for a  load, phase voltages and line voltages are the same thing.
For the generator, EAN, EBN, and ECN are phase voltages.
Line currents are the currents in the line conductors. Only a single sub-
script is needed. You can use either Ia, Ib, and Ic as in Figure 23–6 or IA, IB,
and IC as in Figure 23–4. (Some authors use double subscripts such as IAa,
but this is unnecessary.)
Phase currents are currents through phases. For the Y load Figure 23–
6(a), Ia, Ib, and Ic pass through phase impedances and are therefore phase
currents. For the  load (b), Iab, Ibc, and Ica are phase currents. As you can
see, for a Y load, phase currents and line currents are the same thing.
Phase impedances for a Y load are the impedances from a-n, b-n, and
c-n [Figure 23–6(a)] and are denoted by the symbols Zan, Zbn, and Zcn. For a
 load (b), phase impedances are Zab, Zbc, and Zca. In a balanced load,
impedances for all phases are the same, i.e., Zan  Zbn  Zcn, etc.
Line and Phase Voltages for a Wye Circuit
We now need the relationship between line and phase voltages for a Y cir-
cuit. Consider Figure 23–7. By KVL, Vab  Van  Vbn  0. Thus,
Vab  Van  Vbn
(23–1)
Now, assume a magnitude V for each phase voltage and take Van as refer-
ence. Thus, Van  V∠0° and Vbn  V∠120°. Substitute these two into
Equation 23–1:
Vab  V∠0°  V∠120°  V(1  j0)  V(0.5  j0.866)
 V(1.5  j0.866)  1.732 V∠30°  3V∠30°
But Van  V∠0°. Thus,
Vab  3Van∠30°
(23–2)
Equation 23–2 shows that the magnitude of Vab is 3 times the magni-
tude of Van and that Vab leads Van by 30°. This is shown in phasor diagram
form in Figure 23–8(a). Similar relationships hold for the other two phases.
This is shown in (b). Thus, for a balanced Y system, the magnitude of line-to-
line voltage is 3 times the magnitude of the phase voltage and each line-to-
line voltage leads its corresponding phase voltage by 30°. From this you can
see that the line-to-line voltages also form a balanced set. (Although we
developed these relationships with Van in the 0° reference position, they are
true regardless of the choice of reference.) They also hold at the source. Thus,
EAB  3EAN∠30°

nominal values. Other sets of nominal voltages used in practice are 277/480-V
and 347/600-V.

determine the other five by inspection.
Similar relationships hold for Ibc and Ica. Since line voltages are balanced,
phase currents are also balanced. Now consider again Figure 23–12(a). KCL
at node a yields
Ia  Iab  Ica
(23–7)
After some manipulation, this reduces to
Ia  3Iab∠30°
(23–8)
Thus, the magnitude of Ia is 3 times the magnitude of Iab, and Ia lags Iab by
30°. Similarly, for the other two phases. Thus, in a balanced , the magni-
tude of the line current is 3 times the magnitude of the phase current, and
each line current lags its corresponding phase current by 30°. Since phase
currents are balanced, line currents are also balanced. This is shown in (c).

The Single-Phase Equivalent
By now it should be apparent that if you know the solution for one phase of
a balanced system, you effectively know the solution for all three phases. We
will now formalize this viewpoint by developing the single-phase equiva-
lent approach to solving balanced systems. Consider a Y-Y system with line
impedance. The system may be either a three-wire system or a four-wire sys-
tem with neutral conductor impedance. In either case, since the voltage
between neutral points is zero, you can join points n and N with a zero-
impedance conductor without disturbing voltages or currents elsewhere in
the circuit. This is illustrated in Figure 23–15(a). Phase a can now be iso-
lated as in (b). Since VnN  0 as before, the equation describing phase a in
circuit (b) is the same as that describing phase a in the original circuit; thus,
circuit (b) can be used to solve the original problem. If there are  loads
present, convert them to Y loads using the -Y conversion formula for bal-
anced loads: ZY  Z/3, from Chapter 19. This procedure is valid regardless
of the configuration or complexity of the circuit. We will look at its use in
Section 23.4.

choose EAB or Vab.

Examples
Generally, there are several ways to solve most problems. We usually try to
use the simplest approach. Thus, sometimes we use the single-phase equiva-
lent method and sometimes we solve the problem in its three-phase configu-
ration. Generally, if a circuit has line impedance, we use the single-phase
equivalent method; otherwise, we may solve it directly.

that the impedance of the neutral conductor plays no part in the solution,

Power in a Balanced System
To find total power in a balanced system, determine power to one phase,
then multiply by three. Per phase quantities can be found using the formulas
of Chapter 17. Since only magnitudes are involved in many power formulas
and calculations and since magnitudes are the same for all three phases, we
can use a simplified notation. We will use Vf for magnitude of phase voltage,
If for phase current, VL and IL for line voltage and line current respectively,
and Zf for phase impedance.

Active Power to a Balanced Wye Load
First, consider a Y load (Figure 23–22). The power to any phase as indicated
in (b) is the product of the magnitude of the phase voltage Vf times the mag-
nitude of the phase current If times the cosine of the angle vf between them.
Since the angle between voltage and current is always the angle of the load
impedance, the power per phase is
Pf  VfIfcos vf
(W)
(23–10)
where vf is the angle of Zf. Total power is
PT  3Pf  3VfIfcos vf
(W)
(23–11)
It is also handy to have a formula for power in terms of line quantities.
For a Y load, If  IL and Vf  VL/3, where IL is the magnitude of the line
current and VL is the magnitude of the line-to-line voltage. Substituting these
relations into Equation 23–11 and noting that 3/3  3 yields
PT  3VLILcos vf
(W)
(23–12)
This is a very important formula and one that is widely used. Note carefully,
however, that vf is the angle of the load impedance and not the angle
between VL and IL.
Power per phase can also be expressed as
Pf  If
2Rf  V R
2/Rf
(W)
(23–13)
where Rf is the resistive component of the phase impedance and VR is the
voltage across it. Total power is thus

power, and power factor. Thus, all power formulas are the same. Results are
tabulated in Table 23–2. Note: In all of these formulas, vf is the angle of the
load impedance, i.e., the angle of Zan for Y loads and Zab for  loads.

Power and the Single-Phase Equivalent
You can also use the single-phase equivalent in power calculations. Here, all
single-phase active, reactive, and apparent power formulas apply. The power
is of course just the power for one phase.

Measuring Power in Three-Phase Circuits
The Three-Wattmeter Method
Measuring power to a 4-wire Y load requires one wattmeter per phase (i.e.,
three wattmeters) as in Figure 23–28 (except as noted below). As indicated,
wattmeter W1 is connected across voltage Van and its current is Ia. Thus, its
reading is
P1  VanIacos van
which is power to phase an. Similarly, W2 indicates power to phase bn and
W3 to phase cn. Loads may be balanced or unbalanced. The total power is
PT  P1  P2  P3
(23–22)
If the load of Figure 23–28 could be guaranteed to always be balanced, only
one wattmeter would be needed. PT would be 3 times its reading.

While three wattmeters are required for a four-wire system, for a three-wire
system, only two are needed. The connection is shown in Figure 23–29.
Loads may be Y or , balanced or unbalanced. The meters may be connected
in any pair of lines with the voltage terminals connected to the third line. The
total power is the algebraic sum of the meter readings.

Determining Wattmeter Readings
Recall from Chapter 17, the reading of a wattmeter is equal to the product of
the magnitude of its voltage, the magnitude of its current, and the cosine of
the angle between them. For each meter, you must carefully determine what
this angle is. This is illustrated next.
Section 23.6 I Measuring Power in Three-Phase Circuits
961
EXAMPLE 23–14
For Figure 23–30, Van  120 V∠0°. Compute the read-
ings of each meter, then sum to determine total power. Compare PT to the PT
found in Example 23–11.
Solution
Van  120 V∠0°. Thus, Vab  208 V∠30° and Vbc  208 V∠90°.
Ia  Van/Zan  120 V∠0°/(9  j12)   8 A∠53.13°. Thus, Ic 
8 A∠173.13°.
First consider wattmeter 1, Figure 23–31. Note that W1 is connected to ter-
minals a-b; thus it has voltage Vab across it and current Ia through it. Its reading
is therefore P1  VabIacos v1, where v1 is the angle between Vab and Ia. Vab has
an angle of 30° and Ia has an angle of 53.13°. Thus, v1  53.13°  30° 
23.13° and P1  (208)(8)cos 23.13°  1530 W.

Ic is thus 173.13°  90°  83.13°. Therefore, P2  VcbIccos v2  (208)(8)cos
83.13°  199 W and PT  P1  P2  1530  199  1729 W. (This agrees
well with the answer of 1728 W that we obtained in Example 23–11.) Note
that one of the wattmeters reads lower than the other. (This is generally the
case for the two-wattmeter method.)

reads backwards.)
Answers: P1  289 W;
P2  1275 W;
P1  P2  986 W
To understand why a wattmeter
may read backward, recall that it
indicates the product of the mag-
nitude of its voltage times the
magnitude of its current times
the cosine of the angle between
them. This angle is not the angle
vf of the load impedance; Rather,
it can be shown that, for a bal-
anced load, one meter will indi-
cate VfIfcos(vf  30°) while the
other will indicate VfIfcos(vf 
30°). If the magnitude of (vf 
30°) or (vf  30°) exceeds 90°,
its cosine will be negative and the
corresponding meter will read
backward.

Unbalanced Loads
For unbalanced loads, none of the balanced circuit relationships apply.
Each problem must therefore be treated as a three-phase problem. We will
look at a few examples that can be handled by fundamental circuit tech-
niques such as Kirchhoff’s laws and mesh analysis. Source voltages are
always balanced.
Unbalanced Wye Loads
Unbalanced four-wire Y systems without line impedance are easily handled
using Ohm’s law. However, for three-wire systems or four-wire systems with
line and neutral impedance, you generally have to use mesh equations or
computer methods. One of the problems with unbalanced three-wire Y sys-
tems is that you get different voltages across each phase of the load and a
voltage between neutral points. This is illustrated next.
Section 23.7 I Unbalanced Loads
963
EXAMPLE 23–15
Consider again Figure 23–30.
a. Determine the power factor from the load impedance.
b. Using the meter readings of Example 23–14, determine the power factor

Solution
a. Fp  cos vf  cos 53.13°  0.6.
b. P  199 W and Ph  1530 W. Therefore, P/Ph  0.13. From Figure
23–33, Fp  0.6.
Voltage at a neutral point can be
dangerous.Forexample,inFigure
23–34, if the neutral is grounded
at the source, the voltage at the
load neutral is floating at some
potential relative to ground. Since
we are accustomed to thinking
that neutrals are at ground poten-
tial and hence safe to touch, there
is a potential safety hazard here.
SAFETY NOTE...

Power System Loads
Before we leave this chapter, we look briefly at how both single-phase and
three-phase loads may be connected to a three-phase system. (This is neces-
sary because residential and business customers require only single- phase
power, while industrial customers sometimes require both single-phase and
three-phase power.) Figure 23–40 shows how this may be done. (Even this is
simplified, as real systems contain transformers. However, the basic princi-
ples are correct.) Two points should be noted here.
1. In order to approximately balance the system, the utility tries to connect
one-third of its single phase loads to each phase. Three-phase loads gen-
erally are balanced.
2. Real loads are seldom expressed in terms of resistance, capacitance, and
inductance. Instead, they are described in terms of power, power factor,
and so on. This is because most loads consist of electric lights, motors,
and the like which are never described in terms of impedance. (For exam-
ple, you purchase light bulbs as 60-W bulbs, 100-W bulbs, etc., and elec-
tric motors as 1⁄2 horsepower, etc. You never ask for a 240-ohm light!)

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
PSpice and Electronics Workbench may be used to analyze three-phase sys-
tems (balanced or unbalanced, Y or  connected). As usual, PSpice yields
full phasor solutions, but as of this writing, Workbench yields magnitudes
only. Because neither software package allows component placement at an
angle, Y and  circuits must be drawn with components placed either hori-
zontally or vertically as in Figures 23–42 and 23–45, rather than in their tra-
ditional three-phase form. To begin, consider the balanced 4-wire Y circuit

Draw the circuit on the screen as in Figure 23–43 with source  terminals ori-

click each IPRINT device and set MAG to yes, PHASE to yes, and AC to

frequencies to 60Hz and the number of computational points to 1. Run the
simulation, open the Output File (found under View in the results window),
then scroll down until you find the answers. (Figure 23–44 shows the answer
for current Ia.) Examining the results, you will see that they agree exactly
with what we calculated earlier.

Since the circuit is balanced, you should be able to remove the neutral
conductor from between N-n. If you do however, you will get errors. This is
because PSpice requires a dc path from every node back to the reference, but
because capacitors look like open circuits to dc, it sees node n as floating. A
simple solution is to put a very high value resistor (say 100 k) in the path
between N-n. Its value is not critical; it just has to be large enough to look
like an open circuit. Try it and note that you get the same answers as before.
1. Electronics Workbench and
PSpice make no distinction
between balanced circuits

the computer, they are simply

siderations are necessary for

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
Y
ou have been sent to a job site to supervise the installation of a 208-V,
three-phase motor. The motor drives a machine, and it is essential that
the motor rotate in the correct direction (in this case, clockwise), else the
machine may be damaged. You have a drawing that tells you to connect Line a
of the motor to Line A of the three-phase system, Line b to Line B, etc. How-
ever, you find that the three-phase lines have no markings, and you don’t
know which line is which. Unfortunately, you cannot simply connect the
motor and determine which direction it turns for fear of damage.
You think about this for awhile, then you come up with a plan. You know
that the direction of rotation of a three-phase motor depends on the phase
sequence of the applied voltage, so you make a sketch (sketch A). As indi-
cated in part (a) of that drawing, the motor rotates in the correct direction
when a is connected to A, b to B, etc. You reason that the phase sequence you
need is ...A-B-C-A-B-C... (since the direction of rotation depends only on
phase sequence) and that it really doesn’t matter to which line a is connected
as long as the other two are connected such that you provide sequencing in
this order to the motor. To convince yourself, you make several more sketches
(parts b and c). As indicated, in (b) the sequence is ...B-C-A-B-C-A... (which
fits the above pattern) and the motor rotates in the correct direction, but for
(c) the motor rotates in the reverse direction. (Show why.)
You also remember reading about a device called a phase sequence indica-
tor that allows you to determine phase sequence. It uses lights and a capacitor
as in sketch B. To use the device, connect terminal a to the three-phase line that
you have designated A and connect terminals b and c to the other two lines. The
lamp that lights brightly is the one attached to line B. After a few calculations,
you ask the plant electrician for some standard 120-V 60-W light bulbs and
sockets. From your tool kit, you retrieve a 3.9-mF capacitor (one that is rated
for ac operation).You make a slight modification to the schematic of sketch B,
solder the parts together, wrap exposed wires with electrical tape (for safety),
then connect the device and identify the three-phase lines.You then connect the
motor and it rotates in the correct direction. Prepare an analysis to show why
the lamp connected to B is much brighter than the lamp connected to line C.
(Note: Don’t forget that you made a slight change to the schematic. Hint: If you
use a single 60-W lamp in each leg as shown, they will burn out.)

n our study of induced voltage in Chapter 13 we found that the changing
magnetic field produced by current in one coil induced a voltage in a second
coil wound on the same core. A device built to utilize this effect is the trans-
former.
Transformers have many applications. They are used in electrical power sys-
tems to step up voltage for long-distance transmission and then to step it down
again to a safe level for use in our homes and offices. They are used in electronic
equipment power supplies to raise or lower voltages, in audio systems to match
speaker loads to amplifiers, in telephone, radio, and TV systems to couple sig-
nals, and so on.
In this chapter, we look at transformer fundamentals and the analysis of cir-
cuits containing transformers. We discuss transformer action, types of transform-
ers, voltage and current ratios, applications, and so on. Both iron-core and air-
core transformers are covered.

PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE
George Westinghouse
ONE OF THE DEVICES that made possible the commercial ac power system as we
know it today is the transformer. Although Westinghouse did not invent the
transformer, his acquisition of the transformer patent rights and his manufactur-
ing business helped make him an important player in the battle of dc versus ac in
the emerging electrical power industry (see Chapter 15). In concert with Tesla
(see Chapter 23), Westinghouse fought vigorously for ac against Edison, who
favored dc. In 1893, Westinghouse’s company built the Niagara Falls power sys-
tem using ac, and the battle was over with ac the clear winner. (Ironically, in
recent years dc has been resurrected for use in commercial electrical power sys-
tems because it is able to transmit power over longer distances than ac. However,
this was not possible in Edison’s day, and ac was and still is the correct choice
for the commercial electrical power system.)
George Westinghouse was born in 1846 in Central Bridge, New York. He
made his fortune with the invention of the railway air brake system. He died in
1914 and was elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in 1955.

24.1
Introduction
A transformer is a magnetically coupled circuit, i.e., a circuit in which the
magnetic field produced by time-varying current in one circuit induces volt-
age in another. To illustrate, a basic iron-core transformer is shown in Figure
24–1. It consists of two coils wound on a common core. Alternating current
in one winding establishes a flux which links the other winding and induces
a voltage in it. Power thus flows from one circuit to the other via the medium
of the magnetic field, with no electrical connection between the two sides.
The winding to which we supply power is called the primary, while the
winding from which we take power is called the secondary. Power can flow
in either direction, as either winding can be used as the primary or the sec-
ondary.

Transformer Construction
Transformers fall into two broad categories, iron-core and air-core. We begin
with iron-core types. Iron core transformers are generally used for low fre-
quency applications such as audio- and power-frequency applications. Fig-
ures 24–2 and 24–3 show a few examples of iron-core transformers.
Iron (actually a special steel called transformer steel) is used for cores
because it increases the coupling between coils by providing an easy path for
magnetic flux. Two basic types of iron-core construction are used, the core
type and the shell type (Figure 24–4). In both cases, cores are made from
laminations of sheet steel, insulated from each other by thin coatings of
ceramic or other material to help minimize eddy current losses (Section
24.6).

Section 24.1 I Introduction

FIGURE 24–3
Distribution transformer (cutaway view) of the type used by electric
utilities to distribute power to residential and commercial users. The tank is filled with oil
to improve insulation and to remove heat from the core and windings. (Courtesy Carte
International Inc.)

Iron, however, has considerable power loss due to hysteresis and eddy
currents at high frequencies, and is thus not useful as a core material above
about 50 kHz. For high-frequency applications (such as in radio circuits),
air-core and ferrite-core types are used. Figure 24–5 shows a ferrite-core
device. Ferrite (a magnetic material made from powdered iron oxide) greatly
increases coupling between coils (compared with air) while maintaining low
losses. Circuit symbols for transformers are shown in Figure 24–6.

Winding Directions
One of the advantages of a transformer is that it may be used to change the
polarity of an ac voltage. This is illustrated in Figure 24–7 for a pair of iron-
core transformers. For the transformer of (a) the primary and secondary volt-

Tightly Coupled and Loosely Coupled Circuits
If most of the flux produced by one coil links the other, the coils are said to
be tightly coupled. Thus, iron-core transformers are tightly coupled (since
close to 100% of the flux is confined to the core and thus links both wind-
ings). For air- and ferrite-core transformers, however, much less than 100%
of the flux links both windings. They are therefore loosely coupled. Since
air-core and ferrite-core devices are loosely coupled, the same principles of
analysis apply to both and we treat them together in Section 24.9.
Faraday’s Law
All transformer operation is described by Faraday’s law. Faraday’s law (in SI
units) states that the voltage induced in a circuit by a changing magnetic
field is equal to the rate at which the flux linking the circuit is changing.
When Faraday’s law is applied to iron-core and air-core transformers, how-
ever, the results that emerge are quite different: Iron-core transformers are
found to be characterized by their turns ratios, while air-core transformers
are characterized by self- and mutual inductances. We begin with iron-core
transformers.

At first glance, iron-core transformers appear quite difficult to analyze because
they have several characteristics such as winding resistance, core loss, and
leakage flux that appear difficult to handle. Fortunately, these effects are
small and often can be neglected. The result is the ideal transformer. Once
FIGURE 24–7
The relative direction of the windings determines the phase shift.

you know how to analyze an ideal transformer, however, it is relatively
easy to go back and add in the nonideal effects. This is the approach we use
here.
To idealize a transformer, (1) neglect the resistance of its coils, (2)
neglect its core loss, (3) assume all flux is confined to its core, and (4)
assume that negligible current is required to establish its core flux. (Well-
designed iron-core transformers are very close to this ideal.)
We now apply Faraday’s law to the ideal transformer. Before we do this,
however, we need to determine flux linkages. The flux linking a winding (as
determined in Chapter 13) is the product of the flux that passes through the
winding times the number of turns through which it passes. For flux  pass-
ing through N turns, flux linkage is N. Thus, for the ideal transformer (Fig-
ure 24–8), the primary flux linkage is Npm, while the secondary flux link-
age is Nsm, where the subscript “m” indicates mutual flux, i.e., flux that
links both windings.

Voltage Ratio
Now apply Faraday’s law. Since the flux linkage equals N and since N is
constant, the induced voltage is equal to N times the rate of change of , i.e.,
e  Nd/dt. Thus, for the primary,

Equation 24–3 states that the ratio of primary voltage to secondary volt-
age is equal to the ratio of primary turns to secondary turns. This ratio is
called the transformation ratio (or turns ratio) and is given the symbol a.
Thus,
a  Np/Ns
(24–4)

and
ep/es  a
(24–5)
For example, a transformer with 1000 turns on its primary and 250 turns on
its secondary has a turns ratio of 1000/250  4. This is referred to as a 41
ratio.
Since the ratio of two instantaneous sinusoidal voltages is the same as
the ratio of their effective values, Equation 24–5 can also be written as
Ep/Es  a
(24–6)
As noted earlier, ep and es are either in phase or 180° out of phase, depending
on the relative direction of coil windings. We can therefore also express the
ratio of voltages in terms of phasors as
Ep/Es  a
(24–7)
where the relative polarity (in phase or 180° out of phase) is determined by
the direction of the coil windings (Figure 24–7).
Step-Up and Step-Down Transformers
A step-up transformer is one in which the secondary voltage is higher than
the primary voltage, while a step-down transformer is one in which the
secondary voltage is lower. Since a  Ep/Es, a step-up transformer has a
 1, while for a step-down transformer, a  1. If a  1, the transformer’s
turns ratio is unity and the secondary voltage is equal to the primary volt-
age.

Because an ideal transformer has no power loss, its efficiency is 100% and
thus power in equals power out. Consider again Figure 24–8. At any instant,

Polarity of Induced Voltage: The Dot Convention
As noted earlier, an iron core transformer’s secondary voltage is either in
phase with its primary voltage or 180° out of phase, depending on the rela-
tive direction of its windings. We will now demonstrate why.
A simple test, called the kick test (sometimes used by electrical workers
to determine transformer polarity), can help establish the idea. The basic cir-
cuit is shown in Figure 24–11. A switch is used to make and break the circuit
(since voltage is induced only while flux is changing).

FIGURE 24–11
The “kick” test. For the winding directions shown, the meter kicks
upscale at the instant the switch is closed. (This is the transformer of Figure 24–7a.)
For the winding directions shown, at the instant the switch is closed, the
voltmeter needle “kicks” upscale, then settles back to zero. To understand
why, we need to consider magnetic fields. Before we start, however, let us
place a dot on one of the primary terminals; in this case, we arbitrarily
choose the top terminal. Let us also replace the voltmeter by its equivalent
resistance (Figure 24–12).
At the instant the switch is closed, the polarity of the dotted primary ter-
minal is positive with respect to the undotted primary terminal (because the
 end of the source is directly connected to it). As current in the primary
builds, it creates a flux in the upward direction as indicated by the blue arrow
(recall the right-hand rule). According to Lenz’s law, the effect that results

must oppose the cause that produced it. The effect is a voltage induced in the
secondary winding. The resulting current in the secondary produces a flux
which, according to Lenz’s law, must oppose the buildup of the original flux,
i.e., it must be in the direction of the red arrow. Applying the right-hand rule,
we see that secondary current must be in the direction indicated by is. Plac-
ing a plus sign at the tail of this arrow shows that the top end of the resistor
is positive. This means that the top end of the secondary winding is also pos-
itive. Place a dot here. Dotted terminals are called corresponding terminals.
As you can see, corresponding terminals are positive (with respect to
their companion undotted terminals) at the instant the switch is closed. If
you perform a similar analysis at the instant the switch is opened, you will
find that both dotted terminals are negative. Thus, dotted terminals have the
same polarity at all instants of time. What we have developed here is known
as the dot convention for coupled circuits.

PRACTICAL NOTES...
1. While we developed the dot convention using a switched dc source, it is
valid for ac as well. In fact, we will use it mostly for ac.
2. The resistor of Figure 24–12 is required only to work through the physics
to establish the secondary voltage polarity. You can now remove it without
affecting the resulting dot position.
3. In practice, corresponding terminals may be marked with dots, by color
coded wires, or by special letter designations.

Section 24.2 I Iron-Core Transformers: The Ideal Model
989
Solution
Dotted terminals have the same polarity (with respect to their
undotted terminals) at all instants. During the first half-cycle, the dotted end
of the primary coil is positive. Therefore, the dotted end of the secondary is
also positive. During the second half-cycle, both are negative. The polarity
marks on es mean that we are looking at the polarity of the top end of the sec-
ondary coil with respect to its bottom end. Thus, es is positive during the first
half-cycle and negative during the second half cycle. It is therefore in phase
with ep as indicated in (b). Thus, if ep  Emp sin qt, then es  Ems sin qt.

Reflected Impedance
A load impedance ZL connected directly to a source is seen by the source as
ZL. However, if a transformer is connected between the source and load as in
Figure 24–19(a), the impedance seen by the source is now quite different.
Let this equivalent impedance be denoted as Zp. Then, Ip  Eg/Zp. Rearrang-
ing yields Zp  Eg/Ip. But Eg  Ep, Ep  aEs, and Ip  Is/a. Thus,

squared times the load impedance. The term a2ZL is referred to as the load’s
reflected impedance. Note that it retains the load’s characteristics, that is, a
capacitive load still looks capacitive, an inductive load still looks inductive,
and so on.

a better way to solve complex transformer problems.

Transformer Ratings
Transformers are rated in terms of voltage and apparent power (for reasons
discussed in Chapter 17). Rated current can be determined from these rat-
ings. Thus a transformer rated 2400/120 volt, 48 kVA, has a current rating of
48 000 VA/2400 V  20 A on its 2400-V side and 48 000 VA/120 V 
400 A on its 120-V side (Figure 24–22). This transformer can handle a 48-
kVA load, regardless of power factor.

Transformer Applications
Power Supply Transformers
On electronic equipment, power supply transformers are used to convert
the incoming 120 Vac to the voltage levels required for internal circuit opera-
tion. A variety of commercial transformers are made for this purpose. The
transformer of Figure 24–23, for example, has a multi-tapped secondary
winding, each tap providing a different output voltage. It is intended for lab-
oratory supplies, test equipment, or experimental power supplies.
Figure 24–24 illustrates a typical use of a power supply transformer.
First, the incoming line voltage is stepped down, then a rectifier circuit (a
circuit that uses diodes to convert ac to dc using a process called rectifica-
tion) converts the ac to pulsating dc, a filter smooths it, and finally, a voltage
regulator (an electronic device used to maintain a constant output voltage)
regulates it to the required dc value.
Transformers in Power Systems
Transformers are one of the key elements that have made commercial ac
power systems possible. Transformers are used at generating stations to raise
voltage for long-distance transmission. This lowers the transmitted current
and hence the I 2R power losses in the transmission line. At the user end,
transformers reduce the voltage to a safe level for everyday use. A typical
residential connection is shown in Figure 24–25. The taps on the primary
permit the electric utility company to compensate for line voltage drops.
Transformers located far from substations, for example, have lower input
voltages (by a few percent) than those close to substations due to voltage
drops on distribution lines. Taps permit the turns ratio to be changed to com-

be supplied from the same transformer.
The transformer of Figure 24–25 is a single-phase unit (since residential
customers require only single phase). By connecting its primary from line to
neutral (or line to line), the required single-phase input is obtained from a
three-phase line.

Isolation Applications
Transformers are sometimes used to isolate equipment for safety or other
reasons. If a piece of equipment has its frame or chassis connected to the
grounded neutral of Figure 24–25, for example, the connection is perfectly
safe as long as the connection is not changed. If, however, connections are
inadvertently reversed as in Figure 24–26(b) (due to faulty installation for
example), a dangerous situation results. A transformer used as in Figure 24–
27 eliminates this danger by ensuring that the chassis is never directly con-
nected to the “hot” wire. Isolation transformers are made for this purpose.

Impedance Matching
As you learned earlier, load impedance ZL, when viewed through a trans-
former, has a reflected value of Zp  a2ZL. This means that a transformer can
be used to raise or lower the apparent impedance of a load by choice of turns
ratio. This is referred to as impedance matching. Impedance matching is
sometimes used to match loads to amplifiers to achieve maximum power
transfer. If the load and source are not matched, a transformer can be
inserted between them as illustrated next.

Figure 24–28(a) shows the schematic of a multi-tap
sound distribution transformer with various taps that permit the matching of
speakers to amplifiers. Over their design range, speakers are basically resis-
tive. If the speaker of Figure 24–29(a) has a resistance of 4 , what trans-
former ratio should be chosen? What is the power to the speaker?

Autotransformers
An important variation of the transformer is the autotransformer (Figure
24–32). Autotransformers are unusual in that their primary circuit is not elec-
trically isolated from their secondary. However, they are smaller and cheaper
than conventional transformers for the same load kVA since only part of the
load power is transferred inductively. (The remainder is transferred by direct
conduction.) Figure 24–32 shows several variations. The transformer of (c) is
variable by means of a slider, typically, from 0% to 110%.
For analysis, an autotransformer may be viewed as a standard two-wind-
ing transformer reconnected as in Figure 24–33(b). Voltage and current rela-
tionships between windings hold as they do for the standard connection.
Thus, if you apply rated voltage to the primary winding, you will obtain
rated voltage across the secondary winding. Finally, since we are assuming
an ideal transformer, apparent power out equals apparent power in.

Practical Iron-Core Transformers
In Section 24.2, we idealized the transformer. We now add back the effects
that we ignored.
Leakage Flux
While most flux is confined to the core, a small amount (called leakage
flux) passes outside the core and through air at each winding as in Figure
24–39(a). The effect of this leakage can be modeled by inductances Lp and Ls

as indicated in (b). The remaining flux, the mutual flux m, links both wind-
ings and is accounted for by the ideal transformer as previously.

Winding Resistance
The effect of coil resistance can be approximated by resistances Rp and Rs as
shown in Figure 24–40. The effect of these resistances is to cause a slight
power loss and hence a reduction in efficiency as well as a small voltage
drop. (The power loss associated with coil resistance is called copper loss
and varies as the square of the load current.)

Core Loss
Losses occur in the core because of eddy currents and hysteresis. First,
consider eddy currents. Since iron is a conductor, voltage is induced in the
core as flux varies. This voltage creates currents that circulate as “eddies”

within the core itself. One way to reduce these currents is to break their path
of circulation by constructing the core from thin laminations of steel rather
than using a solid block of iron. Laminations are insulated from each other
by a coat of ceramic, varnish, or similar insulating material. (Although this
does not eliminate eddy currents, it greatly reduces them.) Power and audio
transformers are built this way (Figure 24–4). Another way to reduce eddy
currents is to use powdered iron held together by an insulating binder. Ferrite
cores are made like this.
Now consider hysteresis. Because flux constantly reverses, magnetic
domains in the core steel constantly reverse as well. This takes energy. How-
ever, this energy is minimized by using special grain-oriented transformer
steel.
The sum of hysteresis and eddy current loss is called core loss or iron
loss. In a well-designed transformer, it is small, typically one to two percent
of the transformer rating. The effect of core loss can be modeled as a resis-
tor, Rc in Figure 24–41. Core losses vary approximately as the square of
applied voltage. As long as voltage is constant (which it normally is), core
losses remain constant.

Final iron-core transformer equivalent circuit.
Other Effects
We have also neglected magnetizing current. In a real transformer, how-
ever, some current is required to magnetize the core. To account for this, add
path Lm as shown in Figure 24–41. Stray capacitances also exist between var-
ious parts of the transformer. They can be approximated by lumped capaci-
tances as indicated.
The Full Equivalent
Figure 24–41 shows the final equivalent with all effects incorporated. How
good is it? Calculations based on this model agree exceptionally well with
measurements made on real transformers. However, the circuit is complex
and awkward to use. In practice, therefore, only those elements of the model
that affect a given application are actually retained. For example, at power
frequencies, the effect of capacitance is negligible and the capacitors are
omitted for power frequency analysis.

Voltage Regulation
Because of the internal impedance of a transformer (Figure 24–41) volt-
age drops occur inside the transformer. Therefore, the output voltage of a
transformer under load is different from its voltage under no load. This
change in voltage (expressed as a percentage of full-load voltage) is termed
regulation. For regulation analysis, parallel branches Rc and Lm and stray
capacitance have negligible effect and can be neglected. This yields the
simplified circuit of Figure 24–42(a). Even greater simplification is
achieved by reflecting secondary impedances into the primary. This yields
the circuit of (b). The reflected load voltage is aVL and the reflected load
current is IL/a. Regulation calculations are performed using this simplified
circuit.

Transformer Tests
Losses may be determined experimentally using the short-circuit test and
the open-circuit test. (These tests are used mainly with power transformers.)
They provide the data needed to determine a transformer’s equivalent circuit
and to compute its efficiency.
The Short-Circuit Test
Figure 24–46 shows the test setup for the short-circuit test. Starting at 0 V,
gradually increase Eg until the ammeter indicates the rated current. (This
occurs at about 5 percent rated input voltage.) Since core losses are propor-
tional to the square of voltage, at 5 percent rated voltage, core losses are neg-
ligible. The losses that you measure are therefore only copper losses.

of input voltage to output voltage at no load.
2. The voltage rating of a transformer (such as 1200/120 V) is referred to as
its nominal rating. The ratio of nominal voltages is the same as the turns
ratio. Thus, for a nonloaded transformer, if nominal voltage is applied to
the primary, nominal voltage will appear at the secondary.
3. Transformers are normally operated close to their nominal voltages. How-
ever, depending on operating conditions, they may be a few percent above
or below rated voltage at any given time.

The Open-Circuit Test
The setup for the open-circuit test is shown in Figure 24–48. Apply the full

Since the exciting current is small, power loss in the winding resistance is
negligible, and the power that you measure is just core loss.

Voltage and Frequency Effects
Iron-core transformer characteristics vary with frequency and voltage. To
determine why, we start with Faraday’s law, e  Nd/dt. Specializing this to
the sinusoidal ac case, it can be shown that
Ep  4.44fNpm
(24–14)
where m is the mutual core flux.

Effect of Voltage
First, assume constant frequency. Since m  Ep/4.44fNp, the core flux is
proportional to the applied voltage. Thus, if the applied voltage is increased,
the core flux increases. Since magnetizing current is required to produce this
flux, magnetizing current must increase as well. An examination of the B-H
curves of Chapter 12 shows that magnetizing current increases dramatically
when flux density rises above the knee of the curve; in fact, the effect is so
pronounced that the magnetizing current is no longer negligible, but may
exceed the load current! For this reason, power transformers should be oper-
ated only at or near their rated voltage.
Effect of Frequency
Audio transformers must operate over a range of frequencies. Consider again
m  Ep/4.44fNp. As this indicates, decreasing the frequency increases the
core flux and hence the magnetizing current. At low frequencies, this larger
current increases internal voltage drops and hence decreases the output volt-
age as indicated in Figure 24–49. Now consider increasing the frequency. As
frequency increases, leakage inductance and shunt capacitance cause the
voltage to fall off. To compensate for this, audio transformers are sometimes
designed so that their internal capacitances resonate with their inductances to
extend the operating range. This is what causes the peaking at the high-fre-
quency end of the curve.

Loosely Coupled Circuits
We now turn our attention to coupled circuits that do not have iron cores. For
such circuits, only a portion of the flux produced by one coil links another
and the coils are said to be loosely coupled. Loosely coupled circuits cannot
be characterized by turns ratios; rather, as you will see, they are character-
ized by self- and mutual inductances. Air-core transformers, ferrite-core
transformers, and general inductive circuit coupling fall into this category. In
this section, we develop the main ideas.
A transformer with a nominal rating of 240/120 V, 60 Hz, has its load on the
120-V side. Suppose Rp  0.4 , Lp  1.061 mH, Rs  0.1 , and Ls 

CHECK 3

Voltages in Air-Core Coils
To begin, consider the isolated (noncoupled) coil of Figure 24–50. As shown
in Chapter 13, the voltage across this coil is given by vL  Ldi/dt, where i is
the current through the coil and L is its inductance. Note carefully the polar-
ity of the voltage; the plus sign goes at the tail of the current arrow. Because
the coil’s voltage is created by its own current, it is called a self-induced
voltage.
Now consider a pair of coupled coils (Figure 24–51). When coil 1 alone
is energized as in (a), it looks just like the isolated coil of Figure 24–50; thus
its voltage is
v11  L1di1/dt
(self-induced in coil 1)
where L1 is the self-inductance of coil 1 and the subscripts indicate that v11 is
the voltage across coil 1 due to its own current. Similarly, when coil 2 alone
is energized as in (b), its self-induced voltage is
v22  L2di2/dt
(self-induced in coil 2)
For both of these self-voltages, note that the plus sign goes at the tail of their
respective current arrows.
Mutual Voltages
Consider again Figure 24–51(a). When coil 1 is energized, some of the flux
that it produces links coil 2, inducing voltage v21 in coil 2. Since the flux
here is due to i1 alone, v21 is proportional to the rate of change of i1. Let the
constant of proportionality be M. Then,
v21  Mdi1/dt
(mutually induced in coil 2)
v21 is the mutually induced voltage in coil 2 and M is the mutual induc-
tance between the coils. It has units of henries. Similarly, when coil 2 alone
is energized as in (b), the voltage induced in coil 1 is
v12  Mdi2/dt
(mutually induced in coil 1)
When both coils are energized, the voltage of each coil can be found by
superposition; in each coil, the induced voltage is the sum of its self-voltage
plus the voltage mutually induced due to the current in the other coil. The
sign of the self term for each coil is straightforward: It is determined by
placing a plus sign at the tail of the current arrow for the coil as shown in
Figures 24–51(a) and (b). The polarity of the mutual term, however, depends
on whether the mutual voltage is additive or subtractive.
Additive and Subtractive Voltages
Whether self- and mutual voltages add or subtract depends on the direction
of currents through the coils relative to their winding directions. This is best
described in terms of the dot convention. Consider Figure 24–52(a). Com-
paring the coils here to Figure 24–12, you can see that their top ends corre-
spond and thus can be marked with dots. Now let currents enter both coils at
dotted ends. Using the right-hand rule, you can see that their fluxes add. The
total flux linking coil 1 is therefore the sum of that produced by i1 and i2;

The Dot Rule
As you can see, the signs of the mutual voltage terms in Equations 24–15 are
positive when both currents enter dotted terminals, but negative when one
current enters a dotted terminal and the other enters an undotted terminal.
Stated another way, the sign of the mutual voltage is the same as the sign of
its self-voltage when both currents enter dotted (or undotted) terminals, but
is opposite when one current enters a dotted terminal and the other enters an
undotted terminal. This observation provides us with a procedure for deter-
mining voltage polarities in coupled circuits.
1. Assign a direction for currents i1 and i2.
2. Place a plus sign at the tail of the current arrow for each coil to denote the
polarity of its self-induced voltage.

3. If both currents enter (or both leave) dotted terminals, make the sign of
the mutually induced voltage the same as the sign of the self-induced
voltage when you write the equation.
4. If one current enters a dotted terminal and the other leaves, make the sign
of the mutually induced voltage opposite to the sign of the self-induced
voltage.

Write equations for v1 and v2 of Figure 24–54(b).
Answer: Same as Equation 24–15.
Coefficient of Coupling
For loosely coupled coils, not all of the flux produced by one coil links the
other. To describe the degree of coupling between coils, we introduce a coef-
ficient of coupling, k. Mathematically, k is defined as the ratio of the flux
that links the companion coil to the total flux produced by the energized coil.
For iron-core transformers, almost all the flux is confined to the core and
links both coils; thus, k is very close to 1. At the other extreme (i.e., isolated
coils where no flux linkage occurs), k  0. Thus, 0  k  1. Mutual induc-
tance depends on k. It can be shown that mutual inductance, self-inductances,
and the coefficient of coupling are related by the equation
M  kL1L
2
(24–16)
Thus, the larger the coefficient of coupling, the larger the mutual inductance.

Inductors with Mutual Coupling
If a pair of coils are in close proximity, the field of each coil couples the
other, resulting in a change in the apparent inductance of each coil. To illus-
trate, consider Figure 24–55(a), which shows a pair of inductors with self-
inductances L1 and L2. If coupling occurs, the effective coil inductances will
no longer be L1 and L2. To see why, consider the voltage induced in each
winding—it is the sum of the coil’s own self-voltage plus the voltage mutu-
ally induced from the other coil. Since current is the same for both coils,
v1  L1di/dt  Mdi/dt  (L1  M)di/dt, which means that coil 1 has an
effective inductance of L
1  L1  M. Similarly, v2  (L2  M)di/dt, giving
coil 2 an effective inductance of L

The effect of unwanted mutual inductance can be minimized by physi-
cally separating coils or by orienting their axes at right angles. The latter
technique is used where space is limited and coils cannot be spaced widely.
While it does not eliminate coupling, it can help minimize its effects.
24.10 Magnetically Coupled Circuits 
with Sinusoidal Excitation
When coupling occurs between various parts of a circuit (whether wanted or
not), the foregoing principles apply. However, since it is difficult to continue
the analysis in general, we will change over to steady state ac. This will per-
mit us to look for the main ideas. We will use the mesh approach. To use the
mesh approach, (1) write mesh equations using KVL, (2) use the dot conven-
tion to determine the signs of the induced voltage components, and (3) solve
the resulting equations in the usual manner using determinants or a computer
program such as MATHCAD.
To specialize to the sinusoidal ac case, convert voltages and currents to
phasor form. To do this, recall from Chapter 16 that inductor voltage in
phasor form is VL  jqLI. (This is the phasor equivalent of vL  Ldi/dt,
Figure 24–50.) This means that Ldi/dt becomes jqLI; in a similar fashion,
Mdi1/dt ⇒jqMI1 and Mdi2/dt ⇒jqMI2. Thus, in phasor form Equations
24–15 become
V1  jqL1I1  jqMI2
V2  jqMI1  jqL2I2

Solution
qL1  (100)(0.1)  10 , qL2  (100)(0.2)  20 , and qM 
(100)(0.08)  8 . Since one current enters a dotted terminal and the other
leaves, the sign of the mutual term is opposite to the sign of the self term.
KVL yields
Loop 1:
E1  R1I1  jqL1I1  jqMI2  0
Loop 2:
E2  jqL2I2  jqMI1  R2I2  0
Thus,
(15  j10)I1  j8I2  100∠0°
j8I1  (20  j20)I2  150∠30°
These can be solved by the usual methods such as determinants or by com-
puter. The answers are I1  6.36∠6.57° and I2  6.54∠2.24°.
These equations describe the circuit of Figure 24–58 as you can see if you
write KVL for each loop. (Verify this.)

24.11 Coupled Impedance
Earlier we found that an impedance ZL on the secondary side of an iron-core
transformer is reflected into the primary side as a2ZL. A somewhat similar sit-
uation occurs in loosely coupled circuits. In this case however, the impedance
that you see reflected to the primary side is referred to as coupled impedance.
To get at the idea, consider Figure 24–62. Writing KVL for each loop yields
Loop 1:
Eg  Z1I1  jqL1I1  jqMI2  0
Loop 2:
jqL2I2  jqMI1  Z2I2  ZLL2  0

where Zp  Z1  jqL1 and Zs  Z2  jqL2. Solving Equation 24–20b for I2
and substituting this into Equation 24–20a yields, after some manipulation,

The term (qM)2/(Zs  ZL), which reflects the secondary impedances into the
primary, is the coupled impedance for the circuit. Note that since secondary
impedances appear in the denominator, they reflect into the primary with
reversed reactive parts. Thus, capacitance in the secondary circuit looks
inductive to the source and vice versa.

First, read Item #2 from “PSpice and EWB Notes for Coupled Circuits” (see
page 1022). As indicated, transformer element XFRM_LINEAR may be used
to model iron-core transformers based solely on their turns ratios. To do
this, set coupling k = 1, choose an arbitrarily large value for L1, then let
L2  L1/a2 where a is the turns ratio. (The actual values for L1 and L2 are not
critical, they simply must be very large.) For example, arbitrarily choose

L1 = 100000 H, then compute L2 = 100000/(22) = 25000 H. This sets a = 2.
Now proceed as follows. Create the circuit of Figure 24–64 on the screen as
Figure 24–67. Use source VAC, set up as shown. Double click VPRINT1 and
then set AC, MAG, and PHASE to yes in the Properties Editor. Repeat for
the IPRINT devices. Double click the transformer and set COUPLING to 1,
L1 to 100000H, and L2 to 25000H. Select AC Sweep and set Start and End
frequencies to 60HZ. Complete the remainder of the setup, run the simula-
tion, then scroll through the Output File. You should find Ig  208.3

PSPICE AND EWB NOTES FOR COUPLED CIRCUITS
1. Electronics Workbench uses the ideal transformer equations Ep/Es  a and
Ip/Is  1/a to model transformers. It also permits you to set winding resis-
tance, leakage flux, and exciting current effects as per Figure 24–41. As of
this writing, however, Electronics Workbench cannot easily model loosely
coupled circuits. (See the Delmar web site at www.electronictech.com for
a method.)
2. The PSpice transformer model XFRM_LINEAR is based on self-induc-
tances and the coefficient of coupling and is thus able to handle loosely
coupled circuits directly. It is also able to model tightly coupled circuits
(such as iron-core transformers). To see how, note that basic theory shows
that for an ideal iron-core transformer, k  1 and L1 and L2 are infinite, but
their ratio is L1/L2  a2. Thus, to approximate the transformer, just set L1 to
an arbitrary very large value, then compute L2  L1/a2. This fixes a, per-
mitting you to model iron-core transformers based solely on their turns
ratio.
3. The sign of the coefficient of coupling to use with PSpice depends on the
dot locations. For example, if dots are on adjacent coil ends (as in Figure
24–59), make k positive; if dots are on opposite ends (Figure 24–62), make
k negative.
4. PSpice requires grounds on both sides of a transformer.
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
A
circuit you are building calls for a 3.6-mH inductor. In your parts bin,
you find a 1.2-mH and a 2.4-mH inductor. You reason that if you con-
nect them in series, the total inductance will be 3.6 mH. After you build and
test the circuit, you find that it is out of spec. After careful reasoning, you
become suspicious that mutual coupling between the coils is upsetting opera-

have a meter that measures only self-inductance. Then an idea hits you. You
de-energize the circuit, unsolder the end of one of the inductors and measure
total inductance. You get 6.32 mH. What is the mutual inductance?

n our analysis of ac circuits, we have dealt primarily with sinusoidal wave-
forms. Although the sinusoidal wave is the most common waveform in elec-
tronic circuits, it is by no means the only type of signal used in electronics. In
previous chapters we observed how sinusoidal signals were affected by the char-
acteristics of components within a circuit. For instance, if a 1-kHz sinusoid is
applied to a low-pass filter circuit having a cutoff frequency of 3 kHz, we know
that the signal appearing at the output of the filter will be essentially the same as
the signal applied to the input. This effect is illustrated in Figure 25–1.
One would naturally expect that the 1-kHz low-pass filter would allow any
other 1-kHz signal to pass from input to the output without being distorted.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
In this chapter we will find that any periodic waveform is composed of
numerous sinusoidal waveforms, each of which has a unique amplitude and fre-
quency. As we have already seen, circuits such as the low-pass filter and the res-
onant tank circuit do not allow all sinusoidal frequencies to pass from the input
to the output in the same manner. As a result, the output signal may be dramati-
cally different from the signal applied at the input. For example, if we were to
apply a 1-kHz square wave to a low-pass filter having a 3-kHz cutoff, the output
would appear as shown in Figure 25–2.
1031
CHAPTER PREVIEW
Although the frequency of the square wave is less than the 3-kHz cutoff fre-
quency of the filter, we will find that the square wave has many high-frequency
components which are well above the cutoff frequency. It is these components
which are affected in the filter and this results in the distortion of the output
waveform.
Once a periodic waveform is reduced to the summation of sinusoidal wave-
forms, it is a fairly simple matter to determine how various frequency compo-
nents of the original signal will be affected by the circuit. The overall response
of the circuit to a particular waveform can then be found.

The voltage appearing across the load is determined by superposition as
the combination of the ac source in series with a dc source. The result is a
sine wave with a dc offset. As one might expect, when a composite wave is
applied to a load resistor, the resulting power is determined by considering
the effects of both signals. The rms voltage of the composite waveform is

Chapter 25 I Nonsinusoidal Waveforms
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier
FOURIER WAS BORN IN AUXERRE, Yonne, France on March 21, 1768. As a
youth, Fourier reluctantly studied for the priesthood in the monastery of Saint-
Benoit-sur Loire. However, his interest was in mathematics. In 1798, Fourier
accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, where he was made a governor. After return-
ing to France, Fourier was particularly interested in the study of heat transfer
between two points of different temperature. He was appointed joint secretary
of the Academy of Sciences in 1822.
In 1807, Fourier announced the discovery of a theorem which made him
famous. Fourier’s theorem states that any periodic waveform can be written as
the summation of a series of simple sinusoidal functions.
Using his theorem, Fourier was able to develop important theories in heat
transfer, which were published in 1822 in a book titled Analytic Theory of
Heat.
Although still used to describe heat transfer, Fourier’s theorem is used
today to predict how filters and various other electronic circuits operate when
subjected to a nonsinusoidal periodic function.
Fourier died in Paris on May 16, 1830 as the result of a fall down the
stairs.

Any waveform that is made up of two or more separate waveforms is called
a composite waveform. Most signals appearing in electronic circuits are
comprised of complicated combinations of dc levels and sinusoidal waves.

Fourier Series
In 1826, Baron Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier developed a branch of mathe-
matics which is used to express any periodic waveform as an infinite series
of sinusoidal waveforms. Although it seems as though we are turning a sim-
ple waveform into a more complicated form, you will find that the resulting
expression actually simplifies the analysis of many circuits which respond
differently to signals of various frequencies. Using Fourier analysis, any
periodic waveform can be written as a summation of sinusoidal waveforms
as follows:
f(t)  a0  a1 cos qt  a2 cos 2qt  …  an cos nqt  …
 b1 sin qt  b2 sin 2qt  …  bn sin nqt  …
(25–2)
The coefficients of the individual terms of the Fourier series are found
by integrating the original function over one complete period. The coeffi-
cients are determined as

f(t)sin nqt dt
(25–5)
Notice that Equation 25–2 indicates that the Fourier series of a periodic
function may contain both a sine and a cosine component at each frequency.
These individual components can be combined to give a single sinusoidal
expression as follows:
an cos nx  bnsin nx  ansin(nx  90°)  bnsin nx

(25–7)
Therefore, the Fourier equivalent of any periodic waveform may be sim-
plified as follows:
f(t)  a0  c1sin(qt  v1)  c2sin(2qt  v2)  …
The a0 term is a constant which corresponds to the average value of the
periodic waveform and the cn coefficients give the amplitudes of the various
sinusoidal terms. Notice that the first sinusoidal term (n  1) has the same
frequency as the original waveform. This component is referred to as the
fundamental frequency of the given waveform. All other frequencies are
integer multiples of the fundamental frequency and are called the harmonic

when n  3, we have the third harmonic, etc. Using Equations 25–3 to 25–7,
it is possible to derive the Fourier series for any periodic function.

By examining the general expression for the pulse wave of Figure 25–6,
several important characteristics are observed. The Fourier series confirms
that the wave shown has an average value of a0  0.5. In addition, the pulse
wave has only odd harmonics. In other words, a pulse wave having a fre-
quency of 1 kHz would have harmonic components occurring at 3 kHz,
5 kHz, etc. Although the given wave consists of an infinite number of sinu-
soidal components, the amplitudes of successive terms decrease as n
increases.
If we were to consider only the first four nonzero frequency components
of the pulse wave, we would have the following expression:

Although this waveform is not identical with the given pulse wave, we
see that the first four nonzero harmonics provide a reasonable approximation
of the original waveform.
Derivations of Fourier series for certain waveforms are simplified due to
symmetry that occurs in the wave form. We will examine three types of sym-
metry; even, odd, and half-wave symmetry. Each type of symmetry results in
consistent patterns in the Fourier series. The waveforms of Figure 25–8 are
symmetrical around the vertical axis and are said to have even symmetry (or
cosine symmetry).
Section 25.2 I Fourier Series
1037
Waveforms having even symmetry will always have the form
f(t)  f(t)
(Even symmetry)
(25–10)
When the Fourier series of an even symmetry waveform is written, it will
only contain cosine (an) terms and possibly an a0 term. All sine (bn) terms
will be zero.
If the portion of the waveform to the right of the vertical axis in each
signal of Figure 25–9 is rotated 180°, we find that it will exactly overlap the
portion of the waveform to the left of the axis. Such waveforms are said to
have odd symmetry.

Waveforms having half-wave symmetry will always have the form
f(t  T)  f(t)
(Half-wave symmetry)
(25–12)
When the Fourier series of a half-wave symmetry waveform is written, it
will have only odd harmonics and possibly an a0 term. All even harmonic
terms will be zero.
If we refer back to the waveform of Figure 25–6, we see that it has both
odd symmetry and half-wave symmetry. Using the above rules, we would
expect to find only sine terms and odd harmonics. Indeed, we see that Equa-
tion 25–9 has these conditions.
Waveforms having odd symmetry will always have the form
f(t)  f(t)
(Odd symmetry)
(25–11)
When the Fourier series of an odd symmetry waveform is written, it will
only contain sine (bn) terms and possibly an a0 term. All cosine (an) terms
will be zero.
If the portion of the waveform below the horizontal axis in Figure 25–10
is the mirror image of the portion above the axis, the waveform is said to
half-wave symmetry.

Fourier Series of Common Waveforms
All periodic waveforms can be converted into their Fourier equivalent series
by using integration as shown in Section 25.2. Integration of common wave-
forms is time-consuming and prone to error. A more simple approach is to
use tables such as Table 25–1, which gives the Fourier series of several com-
mon waveforms encountered in electrical circuits.

If a given waveform is similar to one of the types shown in Table 25–1
but is shifted along the time axis, it is necessary to include a phase shift with
each of the sinusoidal terms. The phase shift is determined as follows:
1. Determine the period of the given waveform.
2. Compare the given waveform with the figures appearing in Table 25–1
and select which of the waveforms in the table best describes the given
wave.
3. Determine whether the given waveform leads or lags the selected figure
of Table 25–1. Calculate the amount of the phase shift, as a fraction, t, of
the total period. Since one complete cycle is equivalent to 360°, the phase
shift is determined as
f  T
t
  360°
4. Write the resulting Fourier expression for the given waveform. If the
given waveform leads the selected figure of Table 25–1, then add the
angle f to each term. If the given waveform lags the selected figure, then
subtract the angle f from each term.

Section 25.3 I Fourier Series of Common Waveforms
1043
EXAMPLE 25–4
Write the Fourier expression for the first four nonzero
sinusoidal terms of the waveform shown in Figure 25–21.
Solution
Step 1: The period of the given waveform is T  8.0 ms, which
gives a frequency of f  125 Hz or an angular frequency of q  250p rad/s.
Step 2: From Table 25–1, we see that the given waveform is similar to the
square wave of Figure 25–13.
Step 3: The waveform of Figure 25–21 leads the square wave of Figure 25–
13 by an amount equivalent to t  2 ms. This corresponds to a phase shift
of

The above expression may be left as the summation of sine waves. However,
since the cosine wave leads the sine wave by 90°, the expression may be sim-
plified as a summation of cosine waves without any phase shift. This results
in the following:

The waveforms of Table 25–1 provide most of the commonly observed
waveforms. Occasionally, however, a particular waveform consists of a com-
bination of several simple waveforms. In such a case, it is generally easiest if
we first redraw the original waveform as the summation of two or more rec-
ognizable waveforms. Then the Fourier series of each of the individual com-
ponent waves is determined. Finally, the resultant is expressed as the sum-
mation of the two series.

Frequency Spectrum
Most waveforms that we have observed were generally shown as a function
of time. However, they may also be shown as a function of frequency. In
such cases, the amplitude of each harmonic is indicated at the appropriate
frequency. Figure 25–28 shows the display of a 1-kHz sine wave in both the
time domain and the frequency domain, while Figure 25–29 shows the corre-
sponding displays for a pulse waveform.

The frequency spectrum of the pulse wave shows the average value (or
dc value) of the wave at a frequency of 0 kHz and illustrates the absence of
even harmonics. Notice that the amplitude of successive harmonic compo-
nents decreases fairly quickly.
The rms voltage of the composite waveform of Figure 25–29 is deter-

where each voltage, V1, V2, etc., represents the rms value of the correspond-

the rms value of the pulse-wave of Figure 25–29 to be

If the pulse wave were applied to a resistive element, power would be
dissipated as if each frequency component had been applied independently.
The total power can be determined by the summation of the individual con-
tributions of each frequency. In order to calculate the power dissipated at
each sinusoidal frequency, we need to first convert the voltages into rms val-
ues. The frequency spectrum may then be represented in terms of power
rather than as voltage.

Power levels and frequencies of the various harmonics of a periodic
waveform may be measured with an instrument called a spectrum analyzer,
shown in Figure 25–31.
Some spectrum analyzers are able to display either voltage levels or
power levels in the frequency domain, while most others display only power
levels (in dBm). When displaying power levels, the spectrum analyzer usu-
ally uses a reference 50- load. Figure 25–32 shows the display of a 1.0-V
pulse waveform as it would appear on a typical spectrum analyzer.

PRACTICAL NOTES...
Spectrum analyzers are very sensitive instuments. As a result, great care must
be taken to ensure that the input power never exceeds the rated maximum.
When in doubt, it is best to insert an extra attenuator to lower the amount of
power entering the spectrum analyzer.
EXAMPLE 25–7
A spectrum analyzer with a 50- input is used to display
the power levels in dBm of the Fourier series components of the ramp wave-
form shown in Figure 25–33.
Determine the voltage and power levels of the various components and sketch
the resultant display as it would appear on a spectrum analyzer. Assume that
the spectrum analyzer has the same vertical and horizontal settings as those
shown in Figure 25–32.
Solution
The Fourier series of the given waveform is determined from
Table 25–1 as

Because the fundamental frequency occurs at f  2 kHz, we see that harmonic
frequencies will occur at 4 kHz, 6 kHz, etc. However, because the spectrum
analyzer is able to display only up to 10 kHz, we need go no further.
The dc component will have an average value of v0  1.0 V, as expected.

Circuit Response to a Nonsinusoidal Waveform
We have determined that all periodic, nonsinusoidal waveforms are comprised
of numerous sinusoidal components together with a dc component. In Chapter
22 we observed how various frequencies were affected when they were
applied to a given filter. We will now examine how the frequency components
of a waveform will be modified when applied to the input of a given filter.
Consider what happens when a pulse waveform is applied to a bandpass
filter tuned to the third harmonic, as shown in Figure 25–36.

FIGURE 25–36
Since the bandpass filter is tuned to the third harmonic, only the fre-
quency component corresponding to this harmonic will be passed from the
input of the filter to the output. Further, because the filter has a voltage gain
of 0 dB at the center frequency, the amplitude of the resulting sinusoidal out-
put will be the same voltage level as the amplitude of the original third har-
monic. All other frequencies, including the dc component, will be attenuated
by the filter, and so are effectively eliminated from the output.
This method is used extensively in electronic circuits to provide fre-
quency multiplication, since any distorted waveform will be rich in harmon-
ics. The desired frequency component is easily extracted by using a tuned
filter circuit. Although any integer multiplication is theoretically possible,
most frequency multiplier circuits are either frequency doublers or frequency
triplers since higher-order harmonics have much lower amplitudes.

In order to determine the resulting waveform after it passes through any
other filter, it is necessary to determine the amplitude and phase shift of
numerous harmonic components.

a. Determine the dc component at the output of the low-pass filter.
b. Calculate the amplitude and corresponding phase shift of the first four

p
 sin 3qt  5

Since the circuit is a low-pass filter, we know that the dc component will
pass from the input to the output without being attenuated. Therefore
V0(out)  V0(in)  0.5 Vdc
b. By examining the frequency response of Figure 25–36, we see that all
sinusoidal components will be attenuated and phase shifted. From the
graphs we have the following:
1 kHz:
AV1  1.0 dB,
v1  26.6°
3 kHz:
AV3  5.1 dB,
v3  56.3°

AV5  8.6 dB,
v5  68.2°
7 kHz:
AV7  11.2 dB,
v7  74.1°
The amplitudes of the various harmonics at the output of the filter are
determined as follows:

The Fourier series of the output waveform is now approximated as

 0.047 sin (5 qt  68.2°)  0.025 sin (7 qt  74.1°)

grams are able to generate a time-domain display of a waveform from a math-
ematical expression. When the above waveform is plotted in the time domain,
it appears as illustrated in Figure 25–39.

Circuit Analysis Using Computers
PSpice can be used to help visualize the frequency spectrum at the input and
the output of a given circuit. By comparing the input and the output, we are
able to observe how a given circuit distorts the waveform due to attenuation
and phase shift of the various frequency components.
In the following example, we use a low-pass filter that has a cutoff fre-
quency of 3 kHz. We will observe the effects of the filter on a 1-V pulse
wave. In order to complete the required analysis, it is necessary to set up
PSpice correctly.
EXAMPLE 25–9
Use PSpice to find the Fourier series for both the input
and the output waveforms for the circuit shown in Figure 25–42. Use the
Probe postprocessor to obtain both a time-domain and a frequency-domain
display of the input and output waveforms.

Problems
1059
Notice that the output voltage of the third harmonic (3 kHz) is approxi-
mately 0.15 V, while the input voltage of the same harmonic is approximately
0.21 V. As expected, this represents approximately 3 dB of attenuation
between the input and the output at the cutoff frequency.
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
O
ne method of building a frequency multiplier circuit is to generate a sig-
nal which is “rich” in harmonics. A full-wave rectifier is a circuit that
converts a sine wave (which consists of only one frequency component) into
one which appears as shown in Figure 25–17. As we see, the waveform at the
output of the full-wave rectifier is composed of an infinite number of har-
monic components. By applying this signal to a narrow–band-pass filter, it is
possible to select any one of the components. The resulting output will be a
pure sine wave at the desired frequency.
If a sine wave with an amplitude of 10 V is applied to a full-wave recti-
fier, what will be the amplitude and frequency at the output of a passive filter
tuned to the third harmonic? Assume that there are no losses in the full-wave
rectifier or in the filter circuit.

OrCAD–PSpice A/D
OrCAD PSpice (formerly MicroSim PSpice) is a circuit simulation program
designed to analyze electrical and electronic problems using a graphical rep-
resentation of the circuit. Anyone who has worked with previous versions of
the PSpice software will find many similarities between those versions and
the latest release. The applications used in this textbook will help make the
transition a little easier. For those who have never worked with PSpice, this
appendix provides the required steps to guide you through the sometimes-
complicated world of software application. A detailed description of the soft-
ware is provided in the OrCAD Capture User’s Guide. For an evaluation CD
of OrCAD, contact OrCAD at their web site, www.orcad.com. The software
consists of several parts, of which we use only the schematic capture and
PSpice simulation systems.
A.1
Getting Started
You will need to install the software from the CD-ROM. The instructions
provided by OrCAD will guide you through this process. Since the installa-
tion cannot proceed successfully with virus detection software running, it is
necessary to disable this software during the installation.
After you have installed the OrCAD software, the Capture program can
be started as follows:
1. Click the Start menu on the Windows desktop,
2. Select the OrCAD Demo sub-folder from the Program item,
3. Click on Capture CIS Demo. The Capture session frame will open.
Your schematic design and processing will all be done in this frame. To
start a new project in the OrCAD Capture session frame, click on the File
menu, New menu item, and Project item. A New Project box will appear as
shown in Figure A–1.
You will need to give your project a name such as Project 1 and indicate
the location (in which subdirectory) the project is to be saved. In order to
perform a PSpice simulation, it is necessary to select the Analog or Mixed-
Signal Circuit Wizard in the same box. Click OK.
A.2
Entering a Simple Circuit with OrCAD Capture
Although each circuit simulation uses different components, the illustration
that follows shows some of the common commands that are used to con-
struct a schematic, assign values to the parts and run the PSpice simulation.
The PSpice examples throughout the textbook show various applications of

the software. The OrCAD Capture User’s Guide and the OrCAD PSpice A/D
User’s Guide provide additional information on using OrCAD software.
1. Once the project has been named, OrCAD prompts you with the
libraries that you would like to use. In most cases, the default libraries
are sufficient. For this project, we will add two additional libraries;
BREAKOUT and EVAL. Click on breakout.olb, then on Add.
Similarly, click on eval.olb, then on Add. All libraries that are avail-
able for the project are shown in the right-hand box. If you wish to
remove a library from a project, the steps are similar. Click on Finish.
You will now be in the schematic page editor.
2. Click anywhere in the grid of the schematic page editor. You will
observe that a tool palette has been provided as part of the editor. The
tool palette allows you to select various tools with which to create a
schematic page. This palette is easily moved and resized by placing the
cursor at the top of the palette and dragging it (using the left mouse but-
ton) to a new location. Figure A–2 shows the tool palette and the corre-
sponding button functions as well as other tools that are used to simplify
simulation and viewing of the circuit characteristics.
3. The Place part tool is used to construct the circuit shown in Figure A–3.
4. We enter a voltage source by first selecting the SOURCE library. Next,
we may either scroll through the various parts contained in this library
FIGURE A–1

or more easily, move the cursor into the Part box and type VDC fol-
lowed by clicking on OK. The dc source can now be placed anywhere
on the schematic by clicking in the appropriate position. If we had to
place more than one source, we would do so by moving the cursor and
repeating the operation. In this example, we need only one source. The
placement tool is disabled by first right clicking and then selecting End
Mode or by pressing the Esc key.
Notice that the default value of the voltage source is 0V. The value
is easily changed by first double clicking on the default value and then
entering a new value in the Value box. In this case we enter 10V, fol-
lowed by clicking on OK. PSpice does not require that we show the
units. However if units are shown, there must not be any spaces between
the magnitude and the units.

5. Other components are selected using the Place part tool. The capacitor
and resistor are both obtained from the ANALOG library and the switch
is obtained from the EVAL library and then connected using the Place
wire tool. The normally-open switch has a default, TClose value of 0ms
which needs to be changed to 10ms. The capacitor is rotated 90°
counterclockwise by double clicking on the component and using the
Ctrl R command. In order to correctly show the capacitor voltage,
it is necessary to use Ctrl R three times to result in a total of 270°
of rotation.
6. PSpice will not simulate the design unless the circuit has a suitable
ground. The reference node (ground symbol) is placed by clicking on
the Place ground tool, selecting the SOURCE library, and clicking on
0. (In PSpice, ground is always assigned as Node 0.)
7. Once the circuit is completed, it can be simulated. However, if the cir-
cuit were simulated at this point, we would find that the results would
not accurately represent the actual operation. We must give the capacitor
an initial condition. Since it is initially uncharged, the voltage across the
capacitor is 0V. Component characteristics are changed by double click-
ing on the part, which opens the Property editor of Capture. Next we
click on the Parts tab (bottom left) of the Property editor. In order to set
the initial condition of the capacitor to 0V, we enter 0 into the IC (initial
condition) box of the editor. You may find it is necessary to scroll across
to locate the appropriate property. The result is shown in Figure A–4.
FIGURE A–4
Property Editor
The changes are made to the component properties by clicking on
Apply. The Property editor is closed by clicking on X.
8. Using a similar approach, the Property editor is used to change the
default resistance of the switch in its open condition from 1Meg (1 M)
to 1G (1 G).
9. Place a voltage probe as shown in the circuit of Figure A–3 by clicking
on the Voltage Level tool and dragging it to the location shown.
10. The design is now complete and is saved by clicking on the Save docu-
ment tool. You will need to save all schematic changes.
A.3
Simulating a Circuit in OrCAD PSpice
1. The Capture window will display the Project manager as shown in Figure
A–5. Once in the project manager, click on the New Simulation Profile
tool. Enter a name for the profile (e.g., RC Timer) in the Name field.

Appendix A I OrCAD–PSpice A/D
1071
2. The Simulation Settings are used to control how the circuit is analyzed.
For the given design, click on the Analysis tab. In Analysis Type: select
Time Domain (Transient). In Run to time: (TSTOP) enter 100ms. In
Transient options select Maximum step size select enter 20us. Finally,
click on OK to return to the Project Manager. Click on the Run tool.
3. If there are no errors in the design, the Probe window will open.
4. Once in the Probe window, you will see the capacitor voltage as shown in
Figure A–6.

Appendix A I OrCAD–PSpice A/D
Displaying and Labeling Multiple Traces
Multiple traces may be graphed either on the same vertical axis or using
independent y-axis scales. For instance, it is possible to simultaneously dis-
play both capacitor voltage V(C1:1) and current I(C1) for the circuit of Fig-
ure A–3. It is generally good practice to label each trace using the label
menu item. The steps are outlined as follows:
1. In order to add a label to the display, simply select the Plot menu. Click
on Label. You may select from several options, including Text, Line, and
Arrow. The various labels are positioned using the mouse and placed by
clicking in the correct location.
2. Use the Text menu item to label the capacitor voltage as Voltage across
the capacitor.
3. In order to re-label the vertical axis, select Plot, click on Axis Settings. . .
and select the Y Axis tab. Type Capacitor voltage in the Axis Title box
and click on OK.
4. In order to obtain a second plot, we must first generate another axis. Click
on Plot and then Add Y Axis. You should now see that there are two sepa-
rate vertical axes.
5. Add a current trace by clicking on the Trace menu and selecting the Add
Trace menu item. Click on I(C1) to obtain a plot of capacitor current.
Click OK.
6. The plot is labeled by selecting Plot, Label, and then Text, Line, or Arrow.
7. Finally, the current axis is labeled by first selecting the appropriate axis
with the mouse. Notice that as you select an axis,  appears adjacent to
the axis. Select Plot, Axis Settings. . . and click on the Y Axis tab. Type
Capacitor current in the Axis Title box and click on OK. The display
will appear as shown in Figure A–7.

Syntax and Other Things
In designing circuits with OrCAD Capture, you can use either scientific
notation or standard engineering prefixes. For example, you may specify a
12 000-ohm resistor as 12000, 1.2E04, 12k, or 0.012Meg. The previous
illustration shows that PSpice does not require units. However, if units are
used, there must not be a space between the magnitude and the units. In
other words, you may enter 12kohms but not 12k ohms. Table A–1 shows
the prefixes used by PSpice. Notice that M cannot be used to represent mega
(106), since this prefix is used to represent milli (103).
Inductors and Voltage Sources
PSpice does not permit voltage sources and inductors to be connected in
loops. To get around this shortcoming, we simply connect a very small resis-
tor (e.g. 1E-06) in series with the inductor.
Capacitors and Voltage Sources
PSpice requires a dc path from all nodes to the reference node (ground). If
no dc path exists (because of capacitors for example), we may simply insert
a high-value resistor from the node to the reference node.
Component Orientation
Whenever a component is placed into a circuit, it has a default position as
determined by the library from which the component was taken. Any
component can be rotated from its default orientation by entering Ctrl R,
which rotates the component 90° counterclockwise. In order to ensure
that PSpice provides the results that we expect, we must remember that
current through the device is calculated as going from terminal 1 to termi-
nal 2. Various component orientations are shown in Figure A–8. Clearly, if
the component is connected incorrectly, it is likely that the current will be
negative.

Translating Schematics from MicroSim 
into OrCAD Capture
The Schematics-to-Capture translator converts MicroSim schematics, sym-
bol libraries, and package libraries to Capture designs and libraries. It is pos-

1074
Appendix A I OrCAD–PSpice A/D
sible to translate designs generated in MicroSim Schematics from versions
5.4 to 8.0.
The following steps guide you through the process of translating exist-
ing PSpice schematics into Capture schematics. You will find that the
appearance of the circuit is much the same as it was in older versions of
PSpice.
1. Follow the steps outlined in section A.1 Getting Started. As always, you
will need to give your project a name.
2. In order to open an existing schematic, click on the File menu and select
Import Design. The Import Design dialog box shown in Figure A-9 will
open.
3. Click on the PSpice tab.
4. In the Open text box, enter the location and file name of the schematic
that you wish to simulate. You may use the Browse button to find the file
in your computer.
5. In the Save As text box, enter the location and file name of the schematic
that you wish to simulate. The default location is the same as the location
of the original schematic file. The default name is the same as the original
file name with a .OPJ extension. You may use the Browse button to find
the file in your computer.
FIGURE A–9

6. In the MSIM.INI File text box, enter the location of the MSIM.INI file. It
will generally be located in the Windows directory of your computer. If
you were using a demonstration version of the MicroSim PSpice pro-
gram, the file will likely be named msim_evl.ini. This means that you
would need to enter C:\Windows\msim_evl.ini in the text box.
7. Click OK. You may now edit or simulate the circuit as described previ-
ously.

Solution of Simultaneous
Linear Equations
Simultaneous linear equations appear often in the solution of problems in
electrical/electronics technology. The solutions of these equations has been
simplified by a branch of mathematics called linear algebra. Although the
actual theorems and proofs are well outside the scope of this textbook, we
will use some of the principles of linear algebra to solve simple linear
equations. The following is a set of n simultaneous linear equations in n
unknowns:

a21x1  a22x2  …  a2nxn  b2

a21x1  a22x2  b2

Determinants
While substitution may be used for solving simultaneous linear equations in
two variables, it is lengthy and particularly complicated when solving for
more than two unknowns. An easier method used for solving simultaneous
linear equations involves using determinants. We begin by expressing the
simultaneous linear equations (B–1) and (B–2) as a product of matrices:


The value of the second-order determinant is found by taking the prod-
uct of the upper left term and the lower right term (elements of the principal
diagonal) and then subtracting the product of the lower left term and the
upper right term (elements of the secondary diagonal). The result is given as
D  a11a22  a12a21
The unknowns of the simultaneous linear equations are found by using a
technique called Cramer’s rule. In applying this rule, we need to solve the
following determinants:
a11a12
a21a22
The application of Cramer’s rule gives the solution for each unknown by
first placing the determinant of the coefficient matrix in the denominator.
The numerator is then developed by using the same determinant with the
exception that the coefficients of the variable to be found are replaced by the
coefficients of the solution matrix. The resulting solutions are precisely those
found when we used substitution.

The solution of third-order simultaneous linear equations is similar to
the method used for solving second-order equations. Consider the following
third-order simultaneous linear equation:
a11x1  a12x2  a13x3  b1
a21x1  a22x2  a23x3  b2
a31x1  a32x2  a33x3  b3
The corresponding matrix equation is shown as follows:

     
The value of the third-order determinant may be found in one of several
ways. The first method works for only third-order determinants, while the
second method is a more general approach which evaluates any order of
determinant.
Method I.
This method works only for third-order determinants:
1. Begin by writing the original columns of the third-order determinant.
2. Copy the first two columns, placing them to the right of the original
determinant.
3. Add the product of the elements of the principal diagonal to the products of
the adjacent two parallel diagonals to the right of the principal diagonal.
4. Subtract the product of the elements of the secondary diagonal and also sub-
tract theproductsoftheelementsalongthetwoother paralleldiagonals.
The resultant determinant is written as

METHOD II.
This evaluation of determinants is achieved by expansion by
minors. The minor of an element is the determinant which remains after
deleting the row and the column in which the element lies. The value of any
nth-order determinant is found as follows:
1. For any row or column, find the product of each element and the determi-
nant of its minor.
2. A product is given a positive sign if the sum of the row and the column of
the element is even. The product is given a negative sign if the sum is
odd.
3. The value of the determinant is the sum of the resulting terms.
As before, Cramer’s rule is used to solve for the unknowns, x1, x2, and
x3, by using determinants and replacing the appropriate terms of the numera-
tor with the terms of the solution matrix. The resulting determinants and
solutions are given as follows:
By expansion of minors, the determinant of the denominator is found as

FIGURE C–2
For the above circuit, the values of ETh, RTh, and XTh are constant. Although
XTh is shown as an inductor, it could just as easily be a capacitor. The power
delivered to the load is determined as a function of the load impedance as
PL  I2RL 
(C–5)
Maximum power is dependent on two variables, RL and X. Therefore, we
will need to solve for partial derivatives. Maximum power will be transferred
to the load when 

Now, since the partial derivative can only be zero if the numerator of the above
expression is zero, and since ETh and RL are treated as constants, we have
X  XTh  0
or
X  XTh
(C–7)
This result implies that if the Thévenin impedance contains an inductor of
magnitude X, the load must contain a capacitor with the same magnitude.
(Conversely, if the Thévenin impedance were to contain a capacitor, then the
load impedance would need to have an inductor of the same magnitude.)
Next, we determine the partial derivative, 

Now, since the partial derivative can only be zero if the numerator of the

regardless of the load reactance. Therefore, we have

(C–9)
This result shows that the load resistance is dependent upon the load reac-
tance, X. If the reactance of the load is the same type as the Thévenin reac-
tive component (both inductive or both capacitive), then the reactances are
added. If the load reactance is the opposite type of the Thévenin reactive
component, then the reactances are subtracted. If the reactance of the load
can be adjusted to result in maximum power transfer (X  XTh), then equa-
tion (C–9) is simplified to the expected result, namely

related by the power triangle. The magnitude of apparent power
is equal to the product of effective voltage times effective cur-
rent. Its unit is the VA (volt-amp).
atom
The basic building block of matter. In the Bohr model,
an atom consists of a nucleus of positively charged protons and
uncharged neutrons, surrounded by negatively charged orbiting
electrons. An atom normally consists of equal numbers of elec-
trons and protons and is thus uncharged.

through a system. The attenuation is usually measured in deci-
bels, dB.
audio frequency
A frequency in the range of human hearing,
which is typically from about 15 Hz. to 20 kHz.
autotransformer
A type of transformer with a partially com-
mon primary and secondary winding. Part of its energy is trans-
ferred magnetically and part conductively.
average of a waveform
The mean value of a waveform,
obtained by algebraically summing the areas above and below
the zero axis of the waveform, divided by the cycle length of the
waveform. It is equal to the dc value of the waveform as mea-
sured by an ammeter or a voltmeter.
1099
balanced
(1) For a bridge circuit, the voltage between mid-
points on its arms is zero. (2) In three-phase systems, a load that
is identical for all three phases.
band-pass filter
A circuit that permits signals within a range
of frequencies to pass through a circuit. Signals of all other fre-
quencies are prevented from passing through the circuit.
band-stop filter (or notch filter)
A circuit designed to prevent
signals within a range of frequencies from passing through a cir-
cuit. Signalsofallotherfrequenciesfreely passthrough the circuit.
bandwidth (BW)
The difference between the half-power fre-
quencies for any resonant, band-pass, or band-stop filter. The
bandwidth may be expressed in either hertz or radians per second.
Bode plot
A straight line approximation that shows how the
voltage gain of a circuit changes with frequency.
branch
A portion of a circuit that occurs between two nodes
(or terminals).
branch current
The current through a branch of a circuit.
capacitance
A measure of charge storage capacity, for exam-
ple, of a capacitor. A circuit with capacitance opposes a change
in voltage. Unit is the farad (F).
capacitor
A device that stores electrical charges on conductive
“plates” separated by an insulating material called a dielectric.
cascade
Two stages of a circuit are said to be in a cascade con-
nection when the output of one stage is connected to the input of
the next stage.
CGS system
A system of units based on centimeters, grams,
and seconds.
charge
(1) The electrical property of electrons and protons
that causes a force to exist between them. Electrons are nega-
tively charged while protons are positively charged. Charge is
denoted by Q and is defined by Coulomb’s law. (2) An excess or
deficiency of electrons on a body. (3) To store electricity as in to
charge a capacitor or charge a battery.
choke
Another name for an inductor.
circuit
A system of interconnected components such as resis-
tors, capacitors, inductors, voltages sources, and so on.
circuit breaker
A resettable circuit protection device that trips
a set of contacts to open the circuit when current reaches a preset
value.
circuit common
The reference point in a electrical circuit
from which voltages are measured.

circular mil (CM)
A unit used to specify the cross-section
area of a cable or wire. The circular mil is defined as the area
contained in a circle having a diameter of 1 mil (0.001 inch).
coefficient of coupling (k)
A measure of the flux linkage
between circuits such as coils. If k  0, there is no linkage; if k 
1, all of the flux produced by one coil links another. The mutual
inductance M between coils is related to k by the relationship M 
kL1L
2, where L1 and L2 are the self-inductances of the coils.
coil
A term commonly used to denote inductors or windings
on transformers.
conductance (G)
The reciprocal of resistance. Unit is the
siemens (S).
conductor
A material through which charges move easily.
Copper is the most common metallic conductor.
copper loss
The I2R power loss in a conductor due to its resis-
tance, for example the power loss in the windings of a trans-
former.
core
The form or structure around which an inductor or the
coils of a transformer are wound. The core material affects the
magnetic properties of the device.
core loss
Power loss in the core of a transformer or inductor
due to hysteresis and eddy currents.
coulomb (C)
The SI unit of electrical charge, equal to the
charge carried by 6.24  1018 electrons.
Coulomb’s law
An experimental law which states that the force
(in Newtons) between charged particles is F  Q1Q2/4pr2,
where Q1 and Q2 are the charges (in coulombs), r is the distance
between their centers in meters, and  is the permittivity of the
medium. For air,   8.854  1012F/m.

A practical current source can be modeled as
an ideal current source in parallel with an internal impedance.
cutoff frequency, fc or c
The frequency at which the output
power of a circuit is reduced to half of the maximum output

(Hz) or radians per second, (rad/s).
cycle
One complete variation of an ac waveform.
decade
A tenfold change in frequency.
decibel (dB)
A logarithmic unit used to represent an increase
(or decrease) in power levels or sound intensity.
