If you encounter issues whilst running ng build –prod –aot with the compiler 
complaining about authService and/ or the controls property, make sure to have a look 
at the optimizations-final.zip file (attached to last lecture of this module). 
 
There, both issues have been fixed by not referencing authService directly in the header 
template and by fetching the controls of the FormArray in the TS class instead of the 
template.
